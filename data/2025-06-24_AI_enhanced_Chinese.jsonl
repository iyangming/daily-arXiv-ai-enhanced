This\nreview presents a forward-looking perspective on monitoring and maintaining the\n\"health\" of AI systems in healthcare. We highlight the urgent need for\ncontinuous performance monitoring, early degradation detection, and effective\nself-correction mechanisms. The paper begins by reviewing common causes of\nperformance degradation at both data and model levels. We then summarize key\ntechniques for detecting data and model drift, followed by an in-depth look at\nroot cause analysis. Correction strategies are further reviewed, ranging from\nmodel retraining to test-time adaptation. Our survey spans both traditional\nmachine learning models and state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs),\noffering insights into their strengths and limitations. Finally, we discuss\nongoing technical challenges and propose future research directions. This work\naims to guide the development of reliable, robust medical AI systems capable of\nsustaining safe, long-term deployment in dynamic clinical settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "该论文综述了医疗AI系统在长期部署中性能下降的原因及应对策略，强调持续监控、早期检测和自我纠正的重要性。", "motivation": "医疗AI系统在动态临床环境中性能可能下降，影响可靠性和安全性，需研究如何维持其长期健康。", "method": "回顾性能下降的常见原因，总结数据与模型漂移检测技术，分析根源并提出纠正策略（如模型再训练）。", "result": "提供了从传统机器学习到大型语言模型的性能维护方法，并指出其优缺点。", "conclusion": "论文为开发可靠、稳健的医疗AI系统提供了指导，并提出了未来研究方向。"}}

In this study, we propose that it is necessary to\nmeasure the theory of mind capabilities of LLMs. We begin by reviewing existing\nresearch on theory of mind and identifying the perspectives and tasks relevant\nto its application in safety evaluation. Given that theory of mind has been\npredominantly studied within the context of developmental psychology, we\nanalyze developmental trends across a series of open-weight LLMs. Our results\nindicate that while LLMs have improved in reading comprehension, their theory\nof mind capabilities have not shown comparable development.

What drives this stability in the\ngeneration? We investigate this phenomenon through the lens of probability\nconcentration in the model's output distribution. To quantify this\nconcentration, we introduce the Branching Factor (BF) -- a token-invariant\nmeasure of the effective number of plausible next steps during generation. Our\nempirical analysis reveals two key findings: (1) BF often decreases as\ngeneration progresses, suggesting that LLMs become more predictable as they\ngenerate. (2) alignment tuning substantially sharpens the model's output\ndistribution from the outset, reducing BF by nearly an order of magnitude\n(e.g., from 12 to 1.2) relative to base models. This stark reduction helps\nexplain why aligned models often appear less sensitive to decoding strategies.\nBuilding on this insight, we find this stability has surprising implications\nfor complex reasoning. Aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT) models (e.g.,\nDeepSeek-distilled models), for instance, leverage this effect; by generating\nlonger reasoning chains, they push generation into later, more deterministic\n(lower BF) stages, resulting in more stable outputs. We hypothesize that\nalignment tuning does not fundamentally change a model's behavior, but instead\nsteers it toward stylistic tokens (e.g., \"Sure\") that unlock low-entropy\ntrajectories already present in the base model. This view is supported by\nnudging experiments, which show that prompting base models with such tokens can\nsimilarly reduce BF.

To address this, we introduce FilMaster, an end-to-end\nAI system that integrates real-world cinematic principles for\nprofessional-grade film generation, yielding editable, industry-standard\noutputs. FilMaster is built on two key principles: (1) learning cinematography\nfrom extensive real-world film data and (2) emulating professional,\naudience-centric post-production workflows. Inspired by these principles,\nFilMaster incorporates two stages: a Reference-Guided Generation Stage which\ntransforms user input to video clips, and a Generative Post-Production Stage\nwhich transforms raw footage into audiovisual outputs by orchestrating visual\nand auditory elements for cinematic rhythm. Our generation stage highlights a\nMulti-shot Synergized RAG Camera Language Design module to guide the AI in\ngenerating professional camera language by retrieving reference clips from a\nvast corpus of 440,000 film clips. Our post-production stage emulates\nprofessional workflows by designing an Audience-Centric Cinematic Rhythm\nControl module, including Rough Cut and Fine Cut processes informed by\nsimulated audience feedback, for effective integration of audiovisual elements\nto achieve engaging content. The system is empowered by generative AI models\nlike (M)LLMs and video generation models. Furthermore, we introduce FilmEval, a\ncomprehensive benchmark for evaluating AI-generated films.

To address these challenges, we propose\nManipulate in Dream (MinD), a hierarchical diffusion-based world model\nframework that employs a dual-system design for vision-language manipulation.\nMinD executes VGM at low frequencies to extract video prediction features,\nwhile leveraging a high-frequency diffusion policy for real-time interaction.\nThis architecture enables low-latency, closed-loop control in manipulation with\ncoherent visual guidance. To better coordinate the two systems, we introduce a\nvideo-action diffusion matching module (DiffMatcher), with a novel co-training\nstrategy that uses separate schedulers for each diffusion model. Specifically,\nwe introduce a diffusion-forcing mechanism to DiffMatcher that aligns their\nintermediate representations during training, helping the fast action model\nbetter understand video-based predictions. Beyond manipulation, MinD also\nfunctions as a world simulator, reliably predicting task success or failure in\nlatent space before execution. Trustworthy analysis further shows that VGMs can\npreemptively evaluate task feasibility and mitigate risks. Extensive\nexperiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that MinD achieves\nstate-of-the-art manipulation (63%+) in RL-Bench, advancing the frontier of\nunified world modeling in robotics.", "AI": {"tldr": "论文提出了一种名为MinD的分层扩散世界模型框架，通过双系统设计解决视频生成模型在机器人应用中的速度慢和一致性差问题，实现了低延迟闭环控制和可靠的任务预测。", "motivation": "视频生成模型（VGMs）在机器人统一世界建模中具有潜力，但实际应用中存在生成速度慢和视频与动作一致性差的问题。", "method": "MinD采用分层扩散框架，结合低频视频预测和高频扩散策略，并引入DiffMatcher模块和共训练策略以协调两者。", "result": "MinD在RL-Bench中实现了63%以上的操作性能，并在任务预测和风险缓解方面表现出色。", "conclusion": "MinD通过双系统设计和DiffMatcher模块，显著提升了VGMs在机器人操作和世界建模中的性能，推动了统一世界建模的前沿。"}}
