To mitigate these issues, we introduce DACN, a\ndual-attention convolutional network for hyperspectral image super-resolution.\nSpecifically, the model first employs augmented convolutions, integrating\nmulti-head attention to effectively capture both local and global feature\ndependencies. Next, we infer separate attention maps for the channel and\nspatial dimensions to determine where to focus across different channels and\nspatial positions. Furthermore, a custom optimized loss function is proposed\nthat combines L2 regularization with spatial-spectral gradient loss to ensure\naccurate spectral fidelity.
