This\nrequires social intelligence to gather information through a long time span and\nuse it to navigate various social contexts effectively. Whether AI systems are\nalso capable of this is understudied in the existing research. In this paper,\nwe present a novel benchmark, LIFELONG-SOTOPIA, to perform a comprehensive\nevaluation of language agents by simulating multi-episode interactions. In each\nepisode, the language agents role-play characters to achieve their respective\nsocial goals in randomly sampled social tasks. With LIFELONG-SOTOPIA, we find\nthat goal achievement and believability of all of the language models that we\ntest decline through the whole interaction. Although using an advanced memory\nmethod improves the agents' performance, the best agents still achieve a\nsignificantly lower goal completion rate than humans on scenarios requiring an\nexplicit understanding of interaction history. These findings show that we can\nuse LIFELONG-SOTOPIA to evaluate the social intelligence of language agents\nover lifelong social interactions.", "AI": {"tldr": "论文提出了LIFELONG-SOTOPIA基准，用于评估语言模型在长期社交互动中的表现，发现其目标达成率和可信度随时间下降，且与人类表现存在差距。", "motivation": "研究AI系统是否具备长期社交互动的能力，填补现有研究的空白。", "method": "通过LIFELONG-SOTOPIA基准模拟多轮社交互动，语言模型扮演角色完成随机社交任务。", "result": "语言模型的目标达成率和可信度随时间下降，高级记忆方法虽有改进，但仍显著低于人类表现。", "conclusion": "LIFELONG-SOTOPIA可用于评估语言模型在长期社交互动中的社会智能。"}}

In our recent work,\nwe focused on the statics and dynamics of a particular subclass of ANNs, which\nwe refer to as binary ANNs. A binary ANN is a feed-forward network in which\nboth inputs and outputs are restricted to binary values, making it particularly\nsuitable for a variety of practical use cases. Our previous study approached\nbinary ANNs through the lens of belief-change theory, specifically the\nAlchourron, Gardenfors and Makinson (AGM) framework, yielding several key\ninsights. Most notably, we demonstrated that the knowledge embodied in a binary\nANN (expressed through its input-output behaviour) can be symbolically\nrepresented using a propositional logic language. Moreover, the process of\nmodifying a belief set (through revision or contraction) was mapped onto a\ngradual transition through a series of intermediate belief sets. Analogously,\nthe training of binary ANNs was conceptualized as a sequence of such belief-set\ntransitions, which we showed can be formalized using full-meet AGM-style belief\nchange. In the present article, we extend this line of investigation by\naddressing some critical limitations of our previous study. Specifically, we\nshow that Dalal's method for belief change naturally induces a structured,\ngradual evolution of states of belief. More importantly, given the known\nshortcomings of full-meet belief change, we demonstrate that the training\ndynamics of binary ANNs can be more effectively modelled using robust AGM-style\nchange operations -- namely, lexicographic revision and moderate contraction --\nthat align with the Darwiche-Pearl framework for iterated belief change.", "AI": {"tldr": "论文探讨了二进制人工神经网络（ANNs）的静态和动态特性，通过信念变化理论（AGM框架）建模其训练过程，并扩展了先前研究，提出更有效的建模方法。", "motivation": "二进制ANNs在输入输出均为二进制时具有广泛的实际应用价值，但现有研究存在局限性，需改进建模方法。", "method": "采用Dalal的信念变化方法和Darwiche-Pearl框架中的稳健AGM风格操作（如词典修订和适度收缩）来建模二进制ANNs的训练动态。", "result": "证明了这些方法能更有效地描述二进制ANNs的训练过程，克服了全交信念变化的不足。", "conclusion": "扩展了二进制ANNs的理论建模工具，为实际应用提供了更稳健的框架。"}}

To address these issues, we\npropose an integrated framework, FinLMM-R1, combining an automated and scalable\npipeline for data construction with enhanced training strategies to improve the\nmultimodal reasoning of LMM. The Automated and Scalable Pipeline (ASP) resolves\ntextual-visual misalignment in financial reports through a separate paradigm of\nquestion-answer generation and image-question alignment, ensuring data\nintegrity and extraction efficiency. Through ASP, we collect 89,378 aligned\nimage-question pairs from 23,397 financial reports, covering tasks such as\narithmetic reasoning, statistics reasoning, financial explanation, and\nfinancial knowledge. Moreover, we introduce the Thinking with Adversarial\nReward in LMM (TAR-LMM), extending the prior two-stage training framework [1]\nwith additional reward mechanisms. In the first stage, we focus on text-only\ntasks with format and accuracy rewards to guide the model in generating\nwell-structured thinking contents. In the second stage, we construct\nmulti-image contrastive samples with additional reward components including\nimage selection, thinking content length, and adversarial reward to jointly\noptimize the LMM across visual perception, reasoning efficiency, and logical\ncoherence.

This work\naims to address these challenges by proposing a novel multi-view X-ray/CT\nregistration method for intraoperative bone registration. Methods: The proposed\nregistration method consists of a multi-view, contour-based iterative closest\npoint (ICP) optimization. Unlike previous methods, which attempt to match bone\ncontours across the entire silhouette in both imaging modalities, we focus on\nmatching specific subcategories of contours corresponding to bone\nsubstructures.
