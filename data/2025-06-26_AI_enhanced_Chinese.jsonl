What makes a base language model\nsuitable for reinforcement learning? Gaining deeper insight into this question\nis essential for developing RL-scalable foundation models of the next\ngeneration. In this work, we investigate how mid-training strategies shape RL\ndynamics, focusing on two representative model families: Qwen and Llama. Our\nstudy reveals that (1) high-quality mathematical corpora, such as\nMegaMath-Web-Pro, significantly improve both base model and RL performance,\nwhile existing alternatives (e.g., FineMath-4plus) fail to do so; (2) further\nadding QA-style data, particularly long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning\nexamples, enhances RL outcomes, and instruction data further unlocks this\neffect; (3) while long-CoT improves reasoning depth, it can also induce\nverbosity of model responses and unstability of RL training, underscoring the\nimportance of data formatting; (4) scaling mid-training consistently leads to\nstronger downstream RL performance. Building on these insights, we introduce a\ntwo-stage mid-training strategy, Stable-then-Decay, in which base models are\nfirst trained on 200B tokens with a constant learning rate, followed by 20B\ntokens across three CoT-focused branches with learning rate decay. This yields\nOctoThinker, a family of models demonstrating strong RL compatibility and\nclosing the performance gap with more RL-friendly model families, i.e., Qwen.\nWe hope our work will help shape pre-training strategies for foundation models\nin the RL era.

Traditional\nideation methods like Lean Inception lack structured support for these ML\nconsiderations, which can result in misaligned product visions and unrealistic\nexpectations. [Goal] This paper presents Define-ML, a framework that extends\nLean Inception with tailored activities - Data Source Mapping, Feature-to-Data\nSource Mapping, and ML Mapping - to systematically integrate data and technical\nconstraints into early-stage ML product ideation. [Method] We developed and\nvalidated Define-ML following the Technology Transfer Model, conducting both\nstatic validation (with a toy problem) and dynamic validation (in a real-world\nindustrial case study). The analysis combined quantitative surveys with\nqualitative feedback, assessing utility, ease of use, and intent of adoption.\n[Results] Participants found Define-ML effective for clarifying data concerns,\naligning ML capabilities with business goals, and fostering cross-functional\ncollaboration. The approach's structured activities reduced ideation ambiguity,\nthough some noted a learning curve for ML-specific components, which can be\nmitigated by expert facilitation. All participants expressed the intention to\nadopt Define-ML. [Conclusion] Define-ML provides an openly available, validated\napproach for ML product ideation, building on Lean Inception's agility while\naligning features with available data and increasing awareness of technical\nfeasibility.", "AI": {"tldr": "Define-ML是一个扩展Lean Inception的框架，通过结构化活动整合数据和ML技术约束，提升ML产品构思的清晰度和可行性。", "motivation": "传统构思方法缺乏对ML特有挑战（如数据依赖性和技术可行性）的支持，导致产品愿景与实际情况脱节。", "method": "基于技术转移模型开发Define-ML，通过静态验证（玩具问题）和动态验证（工业案例）评估其效用和易用性。", "result": "Define-ML有效澄清数据问题、对齐业务目标与ML能力，并促进跨职能协作，但需专家指导降低学习曲线。", "conclusion": "Define-ML为ML产品构思提供了开放且验证过的解决方案，结合了敏捷性和技术可行性。"}}
