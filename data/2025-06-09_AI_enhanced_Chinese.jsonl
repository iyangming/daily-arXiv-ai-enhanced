Vector Quantization (VQ), a\nclustering-based quantization method, serves as a prevalent solution to this\nissue for its extremely low-bit (even at 2-bit) and considerable accuracy.\nSince a vector is a quantity in mathematics and physics that has both direction\nand magnitude, existing VQ works typically quantize them in a coupled manner.\nHowever, we find that direction exhibits significantly greater sensitivity to\nquantization compared to the magnitude.

In this\npaper, we introduce MF$^2$, a new benchmark for evaluating whether models can\ncomprehend, consolidate, and recall key narrative information from full-length\nmovies (50-170 minutes long). MF$^2$ includes over 50 full-length,\nopen-licensed movies, each paired with manually constructed sets of claim pairs\n-- one true (fact) and one plausible but false (fib), totalling over 850 pairs.\nThese claims target core narrative elements such as character motivations and\nemotions, causal chains, and event order, and refer to memorable moments that\nhumans can recall without rewatching the movie. Instead of multiple-choice\nformats, we adopt a binary claim evaluation protocol: for each pair, models\nmust correctly identify both the true and false claims. This reduces biases\nlike answer ordering and enables a more precise assessment of reasoning. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that both open-weight and closed state-of-the-art\nmodels fall well short of human performance, underscoring the relative ease of\nthe task for humans and their superior ability to retain and reason over\ncritical narrative information -- an ability current VLMs lack.", "AI": {"tldr": "MF$^2$是一个新的基准测试，用于评估模型是否能从全长电影中理解、整合和回忆关键叙事信息，揭示了当前视觉语言模型在深度理解长视频内容上的不足。", "motivation": "当前视觉语言模型在长视频内容理解上存在局限，现有基准测试多关注细节或依赖自动生成的问题，未能反映真实理解能力。", "method": "MF$^2$包含50多部开放许可的全长电影，每部电影配对手工构建的真假声明对，共850多对，评估模型对核心叙事元素的识别能力。", "result": "实验表明，当前最先进的模型在识别真假声明对上的表现远低于人类水平，突显了模型在叙事信息保留和推理上的不足。", "conclusion": "MF$^2$为评估模型对长视频内容的深度理解提供了新标准，揭示了现有模型与人类能力之间的显著差距。"}}

It provides insight into\nhow well a model is trained and can guide decisions on assigning better\nlayer-wise training hyperparameters. In this paper, we address a challenge\nassociated with such eigenspectrum methods: the impact of the aspect ratio of\nweight matrices on estimated heavytailness metrics. We demonstrate that\nmatrices of varying sizes (and aspect ratios) introduce a non-negligible bias\nin estimating heavytailness metrics, leading to inaccurate model diagnosis and\nlayer-wise hyperparameter assignment.
