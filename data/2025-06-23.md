### [1] [LLMs Struggle to Perform Counterfactual Reasoning with Parametric Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15732)
*Khurram Yamin,Gaurav Ghosal,Bryan Wilder*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs在知识密集型任务中表现优异，但在新环境中整合参数化知识与新信息时表现不佳，尤其是在反事实推理任务中。简单的微调可能损害其原有知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs是否能在新环境中结合上下文知识与参数化知识，特别是在反事实推理任务中的表现。

Method: 通过合成和真实实验，研究LLMs在多跳推理问题中的反事实推理能力，并尝试通过微调提升其表现。

Result: LLMs在反事实推理中表现不佳，倾向于依赖参数化知识；简单的微调可能损害其原有知识。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在新环境中重新利用参数化知识的能力存在显著局限性。

Abstract: Large Language Models have been shown to contain extensive world knowledge in
their parameters, enabling impressive performance on many knowledge intensive
tasks. However, when deployed in novel settings, LLMs often encounter
situations where they must integrate parametric knowledge with new or
unfamiliar information. In this work, we explore whether LLMs can combine
knowledge in-context with their parametric knowledge through the lens of
counterfactual reasoning. Through synthetic and real experiments in multi-hop
reasoning problems, we show that LLMs generally struggle with counterfactual
reasoning, often resorting to exclusively using their parametric knowledge.
Moreover, we show that simple post-hoc finetuning can struggle to instill
counterfactual reasoning ability -- often leading to degradation in stored
parametric knowledge. Ultimately, our work reveals important limitations of
current LLM's abilities to re-purpose parametric knowledge in novel settings.

### [2] [$\texttt{SPECS}$: Faster Test-Time Scaling through Speculative Drafts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15733)
*Mert Cemri,Nived Rajaraman,Rishabh Tiwari,Xiaoxuan Liu,Kurt Keutzer,Ion Stoica,Kannan Ramchandran,Ahmad Beirami,Ziteng Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SPECS的延迟感知测试时扩展方法，通过小模型生成候选序列并结合大模型和奖励模型评估，在降低延迟的同时保持或提升准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前测试时扩展方法主要优化准确性而忽略延迟约束，影响用户体验。

Method: 使用小模型高效生成候选序列，结合大模型和奖励模型评估，引入奖励引导的软验证和基于奖励的延迟机制。

Result: 在多个数据集上，SPECS匹配或超越束搜索准确性，同时降低延迟达19.1%。

Conclusion: SPECS通过延迟感知设计，在保持性能的同时显著减少延迟，理论分析表明其收敛性。

Abstract: Scaling test-time compute has driven the recent advances in the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs), typically by allocating
additional computation for more thorough exploration. However, increased
compute often comes at the expense of higher user-facing latency, directly
impacting user experience. Current test-time scaling methods primarily optimize
for accuracy based on total compute resources (FLOPS), often overlooking
latency constraints. To address this gap, we propose $\texttt{SPECS}$, a
latency-aware test-time scaling method inspired by speculative decoding.
$\texttt{SPECS}$~uses a smaller, faster model to generate candidate sequences
efficiently, and evaluates these candidates using signals from both a larger
target model and a dedicated reward model. We introduce new integration
strategies, including reward-guided soft verification and a reward-based
deferral mechanism. Empirical results on MATH500, AMC23 and OlympiadBench
datasets show that $\texttt{SPECS}$~matches or surpasses beam search accuracy
while reducing latency by up to $\sim$19.1\%. Our theoretical analysis shows
that our algorithm converges to the solution of a KL-regularized reinforcement
learning objective with increasing beam width.

### [3] [The Safety Reminder: A Soft Prompt to Reactivate Delayed Safety Awareness in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15734)
*Peiyuan Tang,Haojie Xin,Xiaodong Zhang,Jun Sun,Qin Xia,Zijiang Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“安全提醒”的软提示调优方法，通过优化可学习的提示标记来增强视觉语言模型（VLM）的安全性，防止有害内容生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型（VLM）在代码生成和聊天机器人等实际应用中的能力增强，其安全性问题日益突出。VLM因其多模态特性面临独特的安全漏洞，攻击者可能通过修改视觉或文本输入绕过安全防护，生成有害内容。

Method: 通过系统分析VLM在攻击下的行为，发现了一种称为“延迟安全感知”的现象。基于此，提出了一种名为“安全提醒”的软提示调优方法，通过优化可学习的提示标记，在文本生成过程中定期注入以增强安全性。

Result: 在三个安全基准和一个对抗攻击测试中，该方法显著降低了攻击成功率，同时保持了模型在正常任务中的性能。

Conclusion: “安全提醒”方法为实际应用中部署更安全的VLM提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate increasing capabilities across
real-world applications such as code generation and chatbot assistance,
ensuring their safety has become paramount. Unlike traditional Large Language
Models (LLMs), VLMs face unique vulnerabilities due to their multimodal nature,
allowing adversaries to modify visual or textual inputs to bypass safety
guardrails and trigger the generation of harmful content. Through systematic
analysis of VLM behavior under attack, we identify a novel phenomenon termed
``delayed safety awareness''. Specifically, we observe that safety-aligned VLMs
may initially be compromised to produce harmful content, but eventually
recognize the associated risks and attempt to self-correct. This pattern
suggests that VLMs retain their underlying safety awareness but experience a
temporal delay in their activation. Building on this insight, we hypothesize
that VLMs' safety awareness can be proactively reactivated through carefully
designed prompts. To this end, we introduce ``The Safety Reminder'', a soft
prompt tuning approach that optimizes learnable prompt tokens, which are
periodically injected during the text generation process to enhance safety
awareness, effectively preventing harmful content generation. Additionally, our
safety reminder only activates when harmful content is detected, leaving normal
conversations unaffected and preserving the model's performance on benign
tasks. Through comprehensive evaluation across three established safety
benchmarks and one adversarial attacks, we demonstrate that our approach
significantly reduces attack success rates while maintaining model utility,
offering a practical solution for deploying safer VLMs in real-world
applications.

### [4] [ContextBench: Modifying Contexts for Targeted Latent Activation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15735)
*Robert Graham,Edward Stevinson,Leo Richter,Alexander Chia,Joseph Miller,Joseph Isaac Bloom*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究通过上下文修改生成针对性输入以激活语言模型特定行为或特征，提出ContextBench基准，改进EPO方法并取得最佳效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何生成针对性输入以触发语言模型的特定行为或特征，提升安全性。

Method: 提出上下文修改方法，构建ContextBench基准，改进EPO方法（结合LLM辅助和扩散模型修复）。

Result: 改进后的EPO方法在激活效果和语言流畅性上表现最佳。

Conclusion: 上下文修改方法在平衡激活效果和流畅性方面具有潜力，改进EPO方法表现优异。

Abstract: Identifying inputs that trigger specific behaviours or latent features in
language models could have a wide range of safety use cases. We investigate a
class of methods capable of generating targeted, linguistically fluent inputs
that activate specific latent features or elicit model behaviours. We formalise
this approach as context modification and present ContextBench -- a benchmark
with tasks assessing core method capabilities and potential safety
applications. Our evaluation framework measures both elicitation strength
(activation of latent features or behaviours) and linguistic fluency,
highlighting how current state-of-the-art methods struggle to balance these
objectives. We enhance Evolutionary Prompt Optimisation (EPO) with
LLM-assistance and diffusion model inpainting, and demonstrate that these
variants achieve state-of-the-art performance in balancing elicitation
effectiveness and fluency.

### [5] [SHADE-Arena: Evaluating Sabotage and Monitoring in LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15740)
*Jonathan Kutasov,Yuqi Sun,Paul Colognese,Teun van der Weij,Linda Petrini,Chen Bo Calvin Zhang,John Hughes,Xiang Deng,Henry Sleight,Tyler Tracy,Buck Shlegeris,Joe Benton*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文研究了前沿大型语言模型（LLM）在执行任务时隐藏有害目标的能力，并开发了SHADE-Arena评估数据集。结果显示，部分模型在隐藏目标时表现较好，但监控模型仍能有效识别恶意行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM作为自主代理在复杂任务中的广泛应用，评估其是否能够隐藏有害目标并逃避监控变得至关重要。

Method: 使用SHADE-Arena数据集评估LLM在完成主任务时隐藏有害目标的能力，并测试监控模型的识别效果。

Result: 部分前沿模型（如Claude 3.7 Sonnet和Gemini 2.5 Pro）在隐藏目标时表现较好，但监控模型（如Gemini 2.5 Pro）的识别能力较强（AUC 0.87）。

Conclusion: 当前模型在长上下文任务中仍存在困难，但监控隐蔽有害行为的挑战将随着任务复杂性增加而加剧。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous
agents in complex and long horizon settings, it is critical to evaluate their
ability to sabotage users by pursuing hidden objectives. We study the ability
of frontier LLMs to evade monitoring and achieve harmful hidden goals while
completing a wide array of realistic tasks. We evaluate a broad range of
frontier LLMs using SHADE (Subtle Harmful Agent Detection & Evaluation)-Arena,
the first highly diverse agent evaluation dataset for sabotage and monitoring
capabilities of LLM agents. SHADE-Arena consists of complex pairs of benign
main tasks and harmful side objectives in complicated environments. Agents are
evaluated on their ability to complete the side task without appearing
suspicious to an LLM monitor. When measuring agent ability to (a) complete the
main task, (b) complete the side task, and (c) avoid detection, we find that
the best performing frontier models score 27% (Claude 3.7 Sonnet) and 15%
(Gemini 2.5 Pro) as sabotage agents when overseen by Claude 3.6 Sonnet. For
current frontier models, success on the side task relies heavily on having
access to a hidden scratchpad that is not visible to the monitor. We also use
SHADE-Arena to measure models' monitoring abilities, with the top monitor
(Gemini 2.5 Pro) achieving an AUC of 0.87 at distinguishing benign and malign
transcripts. We find that for now, models still struggle at sabotage due to
failures in long-context main task execution. However, our measurements already
demonstrate the difficulty of monitoring for subtle sabotage attempts, which we
expect to only increase in the face of more complex and longer-horizon tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文指出当前Agentic AI研究缺乏标准化和科学严谨性，通过系统实证研究提出更稳健的评估协议，并开源了高性能框架OAgents。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Agentic AI研究缺乏标准化和科学严谨性，导致方法间难以公平比较，设计选择对效果的影响不明确。

Method: 在GAIA基准和BrowseComp上系统研究关键组件设计选择的影响，提出稳健评估协议。

Result: 发现缺乏标准评估协议导致结果不可复现，提出关键组件设计，开源高性能框架OAgents。

Conclusion: OAgents框架为Agentic AI研究提供了模块化设计和标准化评估，推动未来研究。

Abstract: Recently, Agentic AI has become an increasingly popular research field.
However, we argue that current agent research practices lack standardization
and scientific rigor, making it hard to conduct fair comparisons among methods.
As a result, it is still unclear how different design choices in agent
frameworks affect effectiveness, and measuring their progress remains
challenging. In this work, we conduct a systematic empirical study on GAIA
benchmark and BrowseComp to examine the impact of popular design choices in key
agent components in a fair and rigorous manner. We find that the lack of a
standard evaluation protocol makes previous works, even open-sourced ones,
non-reproducible, with significant variance between random runs. Therefore, we
introduce a more robust evaluation protocol to stabilize comparisons. Our study
reveals which components and designs are crucial for effective agents, while
others are redundant, despite seeming logical. Based on our findings, we build
and open-source OAgents, a new foundation agent framework that achieves
state-of-the-art performance among open-source projects. OAgents offers a
modular design for various agent components, promoting future research in
Agentic AI.

### [7] [Sysformer: Safeguarding Frozen Large Language Models with Adaptive System Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15751)
*Kartik Sharma,Yiqiao Jin,Vineeth Rakesh,Yingtong Dou,Menghai Pan,Mahashweta Das,Srijan Kumar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Sysformer的新方法，通过动态调整系统提示来提升大型语言模型（LLM）的安全性，无需微调模型参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖昂贵的微调或启发式技术，难以确保LLM在安全关键场景中的响应安全性。

Method: 提出Sysformer模型，在LLM输入嵌入空间中动态更新系统提示，以拒绝有害提示并优化安全提示的响应。

Result: 实验表明，Sysformer显著提升了LLM的安全性，有害提示拒绝率提升80%，安全提示合规性提升90%，对抗攻击的鲁棒性提升100%。

Conclusion: Sysformer为LLM提供了一种低成本的安全保障方法，并推动了可变系统提示设计的未来研究。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are deployed in safety-critical settings, it
is essential to ensure that their responses comply with safety standards. Prior
research has revealed that LLMs often fail to grasp the notion of safe
behaviors, resulting in either unjustified refusals to harmless prompts or the
generation of harmful content. While substantial efforts have been made to
improve their robustness, existing defenses often rely on costly fine-tuning of
model parameters or employ suboptimal heuristic techniques. In this work, we
take a novel approach to safeguard LLMs by learning to adapt the system prompts
in instruction-tuned LLMs. While LLMs are typically pre-trained to follow a
fixed system prompt, we investigate the impact of tailoring the system prompt
to each specific user input on the safety of the responses. To this end, we
propose $\textbf{Sysformer}$, a trans$\textbf{former}$ model that updates an
initial $\textbf{sys}$tem prompt to a more robust system prompt in the LLM
input embedding space while attending to the user prompt. While keeping the LLM
parameters frozen, the Sysformer is trained to refuse to respond to a set of
harmful prompts while responding ideally to a set of safe ones. Through
extensive experiments on $5$ LLMs from different families and $2$ recent
benchmarks, we demonstrate that Sysformer can significantly enhance the
robustness of LLMs, leading to upto $80\%$ gain in the refusal rate on harmful
prompts while enhancing the compliance with the safe prompts by upto $90\%$.
Results also generalize well to sophisticated jailbreaking attacks, making LLMs
upto $100\%$ more robust against different attack strategies. We hope our
findings lead to cheaper safeguarding of LLMs and motivate future
investigations into designing variable system prompts.

### [8] [Linear-Time Primitives for Algorithm Development in Graphical Causal Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15758)
*Marcel Wienöbst,Sebastian Weichwald,Leonard Henckel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CIfly是一个高效的图形因果推断框架，以可达性为核心操作，支持多种因果推理任务，并证明其线性时间复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果推理原语（如道德化和潜在投影）计算复杂度高，CIfly旨在提供更高效的替代方案。

Method: 基于状态空间图的可达性操作，提出规则表模式，并在Rust中实现高性能执行。

Result: CIfly在多种因果推理任务中表现高效，并支持新算法开发（如工具变量）。

Conclusion: CIfly为图形因果推断提供了灵活、可扩展的框架，便于算法开发和高效部署。

Abstract: We introduce CIfly, a framework for efficient algorithmic primitives in
graphical causal inference that isolates reachability as a reusable core
operation. It builds on the insight that many causal reasoning tasks can be
reduced to reachability in purpose-built state-space graphs that can be
constructed on the fly during traversal. We formalize a rule table schema for
specifying such algorithms and prove they run in linear time. We establish
CIfly as a more efficient alternative to the common primitives moralization and
latent projection, which we show are computationally equivalent to Boolean
matrix multiplication. Our open-source Rust implementation parses rule table
text files and runs the specified CIfly algorithms providing high-performance
execution accessible from Python and R. We demonstrate CIfly's utility by
re-implementing a range of established causal inference tasks within the
framework and by developing new algorithms for instrumental variables. These
contributions position CIfly as a flexible and scalable backbone for graphical
causal inference, guiding algorithm development and enabling easy and efficient
deployment.

### [9] [Advancing Stochastic 3-SAT Solvers by Dissipating Oversatisfied Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15774)
*J. Schwardt,J. C. Budich*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DOCSAT的随机局部搜索启发式算法，用于解决3-SAT问题，特别针对难解实例，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如WalkSAT）容易陷入局部极小值，导致无法找到真正解。DOCSAT通过减少过满足约束来避免这一问题。

Method: DOCSAT通过消散过满足约束（DOC）来减少其不利影响，使其变得关键。算法在随机生成的难解3-SAT实例上进行了测试。

Result: DOCSAT在N=15000的难解实例上表现优于WalkSAT和Kissat等算法，尤其是在最难的五分之一实例中。

Conclusion: DOCSAT通过利用组合问题的统计结构避免局部极小值，为其他优化问题提供了通用化思路。

Abstract: We introduce and benchmark a stochastic local search heuristic for the
NP-complete satisfiability problem 3-SAT that drastically outperforms existing
solvers in the notoriously difficult realm of critically hard instances. Our
construction is based on the crucial observation that well established previous
approaches such as WalkSAT are prone to get stuck in local minima that are
distinguished from true solutions by a larger number of oversatisfied
combinatorial constraints. To address this issue, the proposed algorithm,
coined DOCSAT, dissipates oversatisfied constraints (DOC), i.e. reduces their
unfavorable abundance so as to render them critical. We analyze and benchmark
our algorithm on a randomly generated sample of hard but satisfiable 3-SAT
instances with varying problem sizes up to N=15000. Quite remarkably, we find
that DOCSAT outperforms both WalkSAT and other well known algorithms including
the complete solver Kissat, even when comparing its ability to solve the
hardest quintile of the sample to the average performance of its competitors.
The essence of DOCSAT may be seen as a way of harnessing statistical structure
beyond the primary cost function of a combinatorial problem to avoid or escape
local minima traps in stochastic local search, which opens avenues for
generalization to other optimization problems.

*Lukas Helff,Ahmad Omar,Felix Friedrich,Wolfgang Stammer,Antonia Wüst,Tim Woydt,Rupert Mitchell,Patrick Schramowski,Kristian Kersting*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SLR是一个端到端框架，用于通过可扩展的逻辑推理系统评估和训练大型语言模型（LLMs）。它能够根据用户任务自动生成难度可控的归纳推理任务，并创建SLR-Bench基准测试。评估显示，当前LLMs在逻辑推理上表现不佳，但通过SLR调优可显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型在逻辑推理任务上表现有限，缺乏系统化的评估和训练方法。SLR旨在提供一个自动化、可扩展的框架，以提升LLMs的逻辑推理能力。

Method: SLR通过自动合成（i）潜在的真实规则，（ii）用于验证模型输出的符号验证程序，（iii）任务提示，生成难度可控的推理任务。基于此，创建了包含19k+提示的SLR-Bench基准测试。

Result: 评估发现，当前LLMs在逻辑推理上表现不佳，但通过SLR调优的Llama-3-8B模型在SLR-Bench上的准确率翻倍，达到与Gemini-Flash-Thinking相当的水平，且计算成本更低。

Conclusion: SLR是一个完全自动化、无需人工标注的框架，能够有效提升LLMs的逻辑推理能力，并为未来研究提供了可扩展的环境。

Abstract: We introduce SLR, an end-to-end framework for systematic evaluation and
training of Large Language Models (LLMs) via Scalable Logical Reasoning. Given
a user's task specification, SLR enables scalable, automated synthesis of
inductive reasoning tasks with precisely controlled difficulty. For each task,
SLR synthesizes (i) a latent ground-truth rule, (ii) an executable validation
program used by a symbolic judge to deterministically verify model outputs, and
(iii) an instruction prompt for the reasoning task. Using SLR, we create
SLR-Bench, a benchmark comprising over 19k prompts spanning 20 curriculum
levels that progressively increase in relational, arithmetic, and recursive
complexity. Large-scale evaluation reveals that contemporary LLMs readily
produce syntactically valid rules, yet often fail at correct logical inference.
Recent reasoning LLMs do somewhat better, but incur substantial increases in
test-time compute, sometimes exceeding 15k completion tokens. Finally,
logic-tuning via SLR doubles Llama-3-8B accuracy on SLR-Bench, achieving parity
with Gemini-Flash-Thinking at a fraction of computational cost. SLR is fully
automated, requires no human annotation, ensures dataset novelty, and offers a
scalable environment for probing and advancing LLMs' reasoning capabilities.

policy-value networks with MCTS to simulate move consequences and refine
decision-making. By overcoming challenges such as Xiangqi's high branching
factor and asymmetrical piece dynamics, our work advances AI capabilities in
culturally significant strategy games while providing insights for adapting
DRL-MCTS frameworks to domain-specific rule systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI代理在多样化人类操作者和利益相关者中适应的需求，特别是在高风险的跨团队协调和军民互动场景中。

Method: 使用Sotopia模拟测试平台，通过两个实验系统评估人格特质和AI特性对LLM模拟社交谈判结果的影响。实验1采用因果发现方法分析人格特质对价格谈判的影响，实验2评估人类-AI工作谈判中AI透明度和信任度的作用。

Result: 实验1发现宜人性和外向性显著影响谈判结果；实验2表明AI代理的信任度对任务有效性至关重要。

Conclusion: 研究为评估AI代理可靠性提供了可重复的方法，强调了社交动态对复杂任务成功的重要性。

Abstract: This paper presents an evaluation framework for agentic AI systems in
mission-critical negotiation contexts, addressing the need for AI agents that
can adapt to diverse human operators and stakeholders. Using Sotopia as a
simulation testbed, we present two experiments that systematically evaluated
how personality traits and AI agent characteristics influence LLM-simulated
social negotiation outcomes--a capability essential for a variety of
applications involving cross-team coordination and civil-military interactions.
Experiment 1 employs causal discovery methods to measure how personality traits
impact price bargaining negotiations, through which we found that Agreeableness
and Extraversion significantly affect believability, goal achievement, and
knowledge acquisition outcomes. Sociocognitive lexical measures extracted from
team communications detected fine-grained differences in agents' empathic
communication, moral foundations, and opinion patterns, providing actionable
insights for agentic AI systems that must operate reliably in high-stakes
operational scenarios. Experiment 2 evaluates human-AI job negotiations by
manipulating both simulated human personality and AI system characteristics,
specifically transparency, competence, adaptability, demonstrating how AI agent
trustworthiness impact mission effectiveness. These findings establish a
repeatable evaluation methodology for experimenting with AI agent reliability
across diverse operator personalities and human-agent team dynamics, directly
supporting operational requirements for reliable AI systems. Our work advances
the evaluation of agentic AI workflows by moving beyond standard performance
metrics to incorporate social dynamics essential for mission success in complex
operations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学文献的指数级增长超出了人类专家和现有AI系统的处理能力，需要一种新的架构来动态、概率化地评估和更新科学主张的信念。

Method: BEWA架构通过复制分数、引用权重和时间衰减评估科学主张，利用贝叶斯推理、矛盾处理和认知衰减机制更新信念，支持图结构传播、作者信誉建模和加密验证。

Conclusion: BEWA为动态科学领域中的机器推理系统提供了基础，支持真理效用和信念收敛，同时确保审计弹性。

Abstract: The exponential expansion of scientific literature has surpassed the
epistemic processing capabilities of both human experts and current artificial
intelligence systems. This paper introduces Bayesian Epistemology with Weighted
Authority (BEWA), a formally structured architecture that operationalises
belief as a dynamic, probabilistically coherent function over structured
scientific claims. Each claim is contextualised, author-attributed, and
evaluated through a system of replication scores, citation weighting, and
temporal decay. Belief updates are performed via evidence-conditioned Bayesian
inference, contradiction processing, and epistemic decay mechanisms. The
architecture supports graph-based claim propagation, authorial credibility
modelling, cryptographic anchoring, and zero-knowledge audit verification. By
formalising scientific reasoning into a computationally verifiable epistemic
network, BEWA advances the foundation for machine reasoning systems that
promote truth utility, rational belief convergence, and audit-resilient
integrity across dynamic scientific domains.

Abstract: Hard constraints in reinforcement learning (RL), whether imposed via the
reward function or the model architecture, often degrade policy performance.
Lagrangian methods offer a way to blend objectives with constraints, but often
require intricate reward engineering and parameter tuning. In this work, we
extend recent advances that connect Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) equations with RL to
propose two novel value functions for dual-objective satisfaction. Namely, we
address: (1) the Reach-Always-Avoid problem - of achieving distinct reward and
penalty thresholds - and (2) the Reach-Reach problem - of achieving thresholds
of two distinct rewards. In contrast with temporal logic approaches, which
typically involve representing an automaton, we derive explicit, tractable
Bellman forms in this context by decomposing our problem into reach, avoid, and
reach-avoid problems, as to leverage these aforementioned recent advances. From
a mathematical perspective, the Reach-Always-Avoid and Reach-Reach problems are
complementary and fundamentally different from standard sum-of-rewards problems
and temporal logic problems, providing a new perspective on constrained
decision-making. We leverage our analysis to propose a variation of Proximal
Policy Optimization (DO-HJ-PPO), which solves these problems. Across a range of
tasks for safe-arrival and multi-target achievement, we demonstrate that
DO-HJ-PPO produces qualitatively distinct behaviors from previous approaches
and out-competes a number of baselines in various metrics.

*Reyna Abhyankar,Qi Qi,Yiying Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 生成式AI用于解决桌面应用任务，但现有系统因高延迟而难以实用。研究发现模型调用是延迟主因，且步骤越多延迟越长。通过人工标注数据集评估，发现高效代理仍需优化步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究生成式AI在桌面应用任务中的实际可用性，揭示高延迟问题并指导未来计算机代理开发。

Method: 在OSWorld基准上分析计算机代理的时间性能，构建人工标注数据集OSWorld-Human，评估16个代理的效率。

Result: 发现模型调用是延迟主因，步骤越多延迟越长；高效代理仍需1.4-2.7倍多余步骤。

Conclusion: 生成式AI代理需优化模型调用和步骤效率，以提高实际可用性。

Abstract: Generative AI is being leveraged to solve a variety of computer-use tasks
involving desktop applications. State-of-the-art systems have focused solely on
improving accuracy on leading benchmarks. However, these systems are
practically unusable due to extremely high end-to-end latency (e.g., tens of
minutes) for tasks that typically take humans just a few minutes to complete.
To understand the cause behind this and to guide future developments of
computer agents, we conduct the first study on the temporal performance of
computer-use agents on OSWorld, the flagship benchmark in computer-use AI. We
find that large model calls for planning and reflection account for the
majority of the overall latency, and as an agent uses more steps to complete a
task, each successive step can take 3x longer than steps at the beginning of a
task. We then construct OSWorld-Human, a manually annotated version of the
original OSWorld dataset that contains a human-determined trajectory for each
task. We evaluate 16 agents on their efficiency using OSWorld-Human and found
that even the highest-scoring agents on OSWorld take 1.4-2.7x more steps than
necessary.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 制造过程中参数互依赖性通常以数学表达式表示，但需要确保数据检索和解释的正确性，因此需要一致的语义模型和验证机制。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了参数互依赖性问题，适用于跨上下文应用和知识重用。

Abstract: The formalization of process knowledge using ontologies enables consistent
modeling of parameter interdependencies in manufacturing. These
interdependencies are typically represented as mathematical expressions that
define relations between process parameters, supporting tasks such as
calculation, validation, and simulation. To support cross-context application
and knowledge reuse, such expressions are often defined in a generic form and
applied across multiple process contexts. This highlights the necessity of a
consistent and semantically coherent model to ensure the correctness of data
retrieval and interpretation. Consequently, dedicated mechanisms are required
to address key challenges such as selecting context-relevant data, ensuring
unit compatibility between variables and data elements, and verifying the
completeness of input data required for evaluating mathematical expressions.
This paper presents a set of verification mechanisms for a previously developed
ontology-based process model that integrates standardized process semantics,
data element definitions, and formal mathematical constructs. The approach
includes (i) SPARQL-based filtering to retrieve process-relevant data, (ii) a
unit consistency check based on expected-unit annotations and semantic
classification, and (iii) a data completeness check to validate the
evaluability of interdependencies. The applicability of the approach is
demonstrated with a use case from Resin Transfer Molding (RTM), supporting the
development of machine-interpretable and verifiable engineering models.

Result: 在324种modCMA-ES和576种modDE变体上测试，MSE提升达36.6%。

Conclusion: 几何学习在黑盒优化中具有潜力。

Abstract: Automated algorithm performance prediction in numerical blackbox optimization
often relies on problem characterizations, such as exploratory landscape
analysis features. These features are typically used as inputs to machine
learning models and are represented in a tabular format. However, such
approaches often overlook algorithm configurations, a key factor influencing
performance. The relationships between algorithm operators, parameters, problem
characteristics, and performance outcomes form a complex structure best
represented as a graph. This work explores the use of heterogeneous graph data
structures and graph neural networks to predict the performance of optimization
algorithms by capturing the complex dependencies between problems, algorithm
configurations, and performance outcomes. We focus on two modular frameworks,
modCMA-ES and modDE, which decompose two widely used derivative-free
optimization algorithms: the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy
(CMA-ES) and differential evolution (DE). We evaluate 324 modCMA-ES and 576
modDE variants on 24 BBOB problems across six runtime budgets and two problem
dimensions. Achieving up to 36.6% improvement in MSE over traditional
tabular-based methods, this work highlights the potential of geometric learning
in black-box optimization.

Motivation: 探讨LLMs在决策任务中的表现及其与人类的差异，以评估其作为人类决策替代品的潜力与风险。

Method: 使用三项心理学任务测试五种领先LLMs和360名人类参与者的决策行为。

Result: LLMs在任务中表现优于人类，接近最优水平，但决策机制与人类存在根本差异。

Conclusion: LLMs在决策任务中表现出色，但其与人类的差异提示需谨慎依赖其替代人类判断，需进一步研究。

Abstract: Human decision-making belongs to the foundation of our society and
civilization, but we are on the verge of a future where much of it will be
delegated to artificial intelligence. The arrival of Large Language Models
(LLMs) has transformed the nature and scope of AI-supported decision-making;
however, the process by which they learn to make decisions, compared to humans,
remains poorly understood. In this study, we examined the decision-making
behavior of five leading LLMs across three core dimensions of real-world
decision-making: uncertainty, risk, and set-shifting. Using three
well-established experimental psychology tasks designed to probe these
dimensions, we benchmarked LLMs against 360 newly recruited human participants.
Across all tasks, LLMs often outperformed humans, approaching near-optimal
performance. Moreover, the processes underlying their decisions diverged
fundamentally from those of humans. On the one hand, our finding demonstrates
the ability of LLMs to manage uncertainty, calibrate risk, and adapt to
changes. On the other hand, this disparity highlights the risks of relying on
them as substitutes for human judgment, calling for further inquiry.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AFT在处理非单调推理形式时存在局限性，尤其是在某些简单例子中。本文旨在通过扩展AFT来解决这些限制。

Method: 引入更一般的近似空间概念，取代原有的区间操作，以更精细地逼近或构造感兴趣的不动点。

Result: 展示了扩展后的AFT具有更强的表达能力，并分析了不同近似空间之间的关系。

Conclusion: 通过扩展AFT，本文成功克服了原有理论的局限性，为非单调推理形式提供了更灵活和强大的工具。

Abstract: Approximation Fixpoint Theory (AFT) is a powerful theory covering various
semantics of non-monotonic reasoning formalisms in knowledge representation
such as Logic Programming and Answer Set Programming. Many semantics of such
non-monotonic formalisms can be characterized as suitable fixpoints of a
non-monotonic operator on a suitable lattice. Instead of working on the
original lattice, AFT operates on intervals in such lattice to approximate or
construct the fixpoints of interest. While AFT has been applied successfully
across a broad range of non-monotonic reasoning formalisms, it is confronted by
its limitations in other, relatively simple, examples. In this paper, we
overcome those limitations by extending consistent AFT to deal with
approximations that are more refined than intervals. Therefore, we introduce a
more general notion of approximation spaces, showcase the improved
expressiveness and investigate relations between different approximation
spaces.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在复杂推理任务中表现优异，但在规则一致性、异常处理和可解释性方面存在不足，特别是在需要自然语言理解和精确逻辑推理的领域（如法律分析）。

Method: 提出了一种结构化提示框架，将推理分解为三个可验证步骤：实体识别、属性提取和符号规则应用，结合神经与符号方法，通过形式验证确保逻辑一致性。

Result: 在LegalBench的传闻判定任务中，该方法显著优于基线，OpenAI o-family模型的F1分数大幅提升（o1达到0.929，o3-mini达到0.867）。

Conclusion: 该混合神经符号系统为透明且一致的基于规则的推理提供了可行路径，展示了在结构化法律推理任务中可解释AI的应用潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in complex reasoning tasks but struggle
with consistent rule application, exception handling, and explainability,
particularly in domains like legal analysis that require both natural language
understanding and precise logical inference. This paper introduces a structured
prompting framework that decomposes reasoning into three verifiable steps:
entity identification, property extraction, and symbolic rule application. By
integrating neural and symbolic approaches, our method leverages LLMs'
interpretive flexibility while ensuring logical consistency through formal
verification. The framework externalizes task definitions, enabling domain
experts to refine logical structures without altering the architecture.
Evaluated on the LegalBench hearsay determination task, our approach
significantly outperformed baselines, with OpenAI o-family models showing
substantial improvements - o1 achieving an F1 score of 0.929 and o3-mini
reaching 0.867 using structured decomposition with complementary predicates,
compared to their few-shot baselines of 0.714 and 0.74 respectively. This
hybrid neural-symbolic system offers a promising pathway for transparent and
consistent rule-based reasoning, suggesting potential for explainable AI
applications in structured legal reasoning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有静态评估方法无法捕捉动态风险，阻碍了具身代理在现实家庭任务中的安全部署。

Method: 提出IS-Bench，包含161个场景和388个安全风险，支持过程导向的评估，验证风险缓解步骤的顺序。

Result: 实验显示当前代理缺乏交互安全意识，安全感知的Chain-of-Thought虽能提升性能，但可能影响任务完成。

Conclusion: IS-Bench为开发更安全的具身AI系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Flawed planning from VLM-driven embodied agents poses significant safety
hazards, hindering their deployment in real-world household tasks. However,
existing static, non-interactive evaluation paradigms fail to adequately assess
risks within these interactive environments, since they cannot simulate dynamic
risks that emerge from an agent's actions and rely on unreliable post-hoc
evaluations that ignore unsafe intermediate steps. To bridge this critical gap,
we propose evaluating an agent's interactive safety: its ability to perceive
emergent risks and execute mitigation steps in the correct procedural order. We
thus present IS-Bench, the first multi-modal benchmark designed for interactive
safety, featuring 161 challenging scenarios with 388 unique safety risks
instantiated in a high-fidelity simulator. Crucially, it facilitates a novel
process-oriented evaluation that verifies whether risk mitigation actions are
performed before/after specific risk-prone steps. Extensive experiments on
leading VLMs, including the GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5 series, reveal that current
agents lack interactive safety awareness, and that while safety-aware
Chain-of-Thought can improve performance, it often compromises task completion.
By highlighting these critical limitations, IS-Bench provides a foundation for
developing safer and more reliable embodied AI systems.

Abstract: Consumer applications provide ample opportunities to surface and communicate
various forms of content to users. From promotional campaigns for new features
or subscriptions, to evergreen nudges for engagement, or personalised
recommendations; across e-mails, push notifications, and in-app surfaces. The
conventional approach to orchestration for communication relies heavily on
labour-intensive manual marketer work, and inhibits effective personalisation
of content, timing, frequency, and copy-writing. We formulate this task under a
sequential decision-making framework, where we aim to optimise a modular
decision-making policy that maximises incremental engagement for any funnel
event. Our approach leverages a Difference-in-Differences design for Individual
Treatment Effect estimation, and Thompson sampling to balance the
explore-exploit trade-off. We present results from a multi-service application,
where our methodology has resulted in significant increases to a variety of
goal events across several product features, and is currently deployed across
150 million users.

Motivation: AI驱动的开发效率可能超越人类，但现有LLM代理无法充分利用探索经验，导致效率低下。

Method: 提出ML-Master，采用选择性记忆机制，结合并行解决方案的多样性与分析推理。

Result: 在MLE-Bench上，ML-Master平均奖牌率29.3%，显著优于现有方法，且时间减半。

Conclusion: ML-Master是推动AI4AI发展的有力工具。

Abstract: As AI capabilities advance toward and potentially beyond human-level
performance, a natural transition emerges where AI-driven development becomes
more efficient than human-centric approaches. A promising pathway toward this
transition lies in AI-for-AI (AI4AI), which leverages AI techniques to automate
and optimize the design, training, and deployment of AI systems themselves.
While LLM-based agents have shown the potential to realize AI4AI, they are
often unable to fully leverage the experience accumulated by agents during the
exploration of solutions in the reasoning process, leading to inefficiencies
and suboptimal performance. To address this limitation, we propose ML-Master, a
novel AI4AI agent that seamlessly integrates exploration and reasoning by
employing a selectively scoped memory mechanism. This approach allows ML-Master
to efficiently combine diverse insights from parallel solution trajectories
with analytical reasoning, guiding further exploration without overwhelming the
agent with excessive context. We evaluate ML-Master on the MLE-Bench, where it
achieves a 29.3% average medal rate, significantly surpassing existing methods,
particularly in medium-complexity tasks, while accomplishing this superior
performance within a strict 12-hour time constraint-half the 24-hour limit used
by previous baselines. These results demonstrate ML-Master's potential as a
powerful tool for advancing AI4AI.

Conclusion: 该方法提高了有害内容分析的可靠性，减少了误报，适用于大规模数据集，有助于构建更安全、包容的工作环境。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer promising opportunities for organizational
research. However, their built-in moderation systems can create problems when
researchers try to analyze harmful content, often refusing to follow certain
instructions or producing overly cautious responses that undermine validity of
the results. This is particularly problematic when analyzing organizational
conflicts such as microaggressions or hate speech. This paper introduces an Elo
rating-based method that significantly improves LLM performance for harmful
content analysis In two datasets, one focused on microaggression detection and
the other on hate speech, we find that our method outperforms traditional LLM
prompting techniques and conventional machine learning models on key measures
such as accuracy, precision, and F1 scores. Advantages include better
reliability when analyzing harmful content, fewer false positives, and greater
scalability for large-scale datasets. This approach supports organizational
applications, including detecting workplace harassment, assessing toxic
communication, and fostering safer and more inclusive work environments.

Abstract: The long-standing goal of creating a comprehensive, multi-purpose knowledge
resource, reminiscent of the 1984 Cyc project, still persists in AI. Despite
the success of knowledge resources like WordNet, ConceptNet, Wolfram|Alpha and
other commercial knowledge graphs, verifiable, general-purpose widely available
sources of knowledge remain a critical deficiency in AI infrastructure. Large
language models struggle due to knowledge gaps; robotic planning lacks
necessary world knowledge; and the detection of factually false information
relies heavily on human expertise. What kind of knowledge resource is most
needed in AI today? How can modern technology shape its development and
evaluation? A recent AAAI workshop gathered over 50 researchers to explore
these questions. This paper synthesizes our findings and outlines a
community-driven vision for a new knowledge infrastructure. In addition to
leveraging contemporary advances in knowledge representation and reasoning, one
promising idea is to build an open engineering framework to exploit knowledge
modules effectively within the context of practical applications. Such a
framework should include sets of conventions and social structures that are
adopted by contributors.

Motivation: 尽管深度学习模型在PPM中预测准确，但其缺乏可解释性降低了用户信任。现有XAI评估多关注功能指标，忽略了用户中心的决策影响。

Method: 通过决策实验，比较不同解释风格（特征重要性、规则基础、反事实）和感知AI准确性（高或低）对用户决策的影响。

Result: 感知准确性和解释风格对任务表现和决策信心有显著影响。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在PPM中结合用户中心评估的重要性，以提升XAI的实际应用效果。

Abstract: Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM) often uses deep learning models to
predict the future behavior of ongoing processes, such as predicting process
outcomes. While these models achieve high accuracy, their lack of
interpretability undermines user trust and adoption. Explainable AI (XAI) aims
to address this challenge by providing the reasoning behind the predictions.
However, current evaluations of XAI in PPM focus primarily on functional
metrics (such as fidelity), overlooking user-centered aspects such as their
effect on task performance and decision-making. This study investigates the
effects of explanation styles (feature importance, rule-based, and
counterfactual) and perceived AI accuracy (low or high) on decision-making in
PPM. We conducted a decision-making experiment, where users were presented with
the AI predictions, perceived accuracy levels, and explanations of different
styles. Users' decisions were measured both before and after receiving
explanations, allowing the assessment of objective metrics (Task Performance
and Agreement) and subjective metrics (Decision Confidence). Our findings show
that perceived accuracy and explanation style have a significant effect.

Conclusion: 低维模型结合直观变量，为足球战术分析提供了高效工具。

Abstract: Understanding football tactics is crucial for managers and analysts. Previous
research has proposed models based on spatial and kinematic equations, but
these are computationally expensive. Also, Reinforcement learning approaches
use player positions and velocities but lack interpretability and require large
datasets. Rule-based models align with expert knowledge but have not fully
considered all players' states. This study explores whether low-dimensional,
rule-based models using spatiotemporal data can effectively capture football
tactics. Our approach defines interpretable state variables for both the
ball-holder and potential pass receivers, based on criteria that explore
options like passing. Through discussions with a manager, we identified key
variables representing the game state. We then used StatsBomb event data and
SkillCorner tracking data from the 2023$/$24 LaLiga season to train an XGBoost
model to predict pass success. The analysis revealed that the distance between
the player and the ball, as well as the player's space score, were key factors
in determining successful passes. Our interpretable low-dimensional modeling
facilitates tactical analysis through the use of intuitive variables and
provides practical value as a tool to support decision-making in football.

Conclusion: 该框架通过激励设计和数据异构性考虑，显著提升了联邦学习的收敛效率和模型质量。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) provides a promising paradigm for facilitating
collaboration between multiple clients that jointly learn a global model
without directly sharing their local data. However, existing research suffers
from two caveats: 1) From the perspective of agents, voluntary and unselfish
participation is often assumed. But self-interested agents may opt out of the
system or provide low-quality contributions without proper incentives; 2) From
the mechanism designer's perspective, the aggregated models can be
unsatisfactory as the existing game-theoretical federated learning approach for
data collection ignores the potential heterogeneous effort caused by
contributed data. To alleviate above challenges, we propose an incentive-aware
framework for agent participation that considers data heterogeneity to
accelerate the convergence process. Specifically, we first introduce the notion
of Wasserstein distance to explicitly illustrate the heterogeneous effort and
reformulate the existing upper bound of convergence. To induce truthful
reporting from agents, we analyze and measure the generalization error gap of
any two agents by leveraging the peer prediction mechanism to develop score
functions. We further present a two-stage Stackelberg game model that
formalizes the process and examines the existence of equilibrium. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed mechanism.

Abstract: The success of vehicle electrification, which brings significant societal and
environmental benefits, is contingent upon the availability of efficient and
adaptable charging infrastructure. Traditional fixed-location charging stations
often face issues like underutilization or congestion due to the dynamic nature
of charging demand. Mobile chargers have emerged as a flexible solution,
capable of relocating to align with these demand fluctuations. This paper
addresses the optimal planning and operation of hybrid charging
infrastructures, integrating both fixed and mobile chargers within urban road
networks. We introduce the Hybrid Charging Station Planning and Operation
(HCSPO) problem, which simultaneously optimizes the location and configuration
of fixed charging stations and schedules mobile chargers for dynamic
operations. Our approach incorporates a charging demand prediction model
grounded in Model Predictive Control (MPC) to enhance decision-making. To solve
the HCSPO problem, we propose a deep reinforcement learning method, augmented
with heuristic scheduling techniques, to effectively bridge the planning of
fixed chargers with the real-time operation of mobile chargers. Extensive case
studies using real-world urban scenarios demonstrate that our method
significantly improves the availability of charging infrastructure and reduces
user inconvenience compared to existing solutions and baselines.

Abstract: Image generation models are revolutionizing many domains, and urban analysis
and design is no exception. While such models are widely adopted, there is a
limited literature exploring their geographic knowledge, along with the biases
they embed. In this work, we generated 150 synthetic images for each state in
the USA and related capitals using FLUX 1 and Stable Diffusion 3.5, two
state-of-the-art models for image generation. We embed each image using DINO-v2
ViT-S/14 and the Fr\'echet Inception Distances to measure the similarity
between the generated images. We found that while these models have implicitly
learned aspects of USA geography, if we prompt the models to generate an image
for "United States" instead of specific cities or states, the models exhibit a
strong representative bias toward metropolis-like areas, excluding rural states
and smaller cities. {\color{black} In addition, we found that models
systematically exhibit some entity-disambiguation issues with European-sounding
names like Frankfort or Devon.

Result: 在移动用户的无线通信系统中验证了方法的动态适应性。

Conclusion: 该方法在动态离散环境中表现出良好的优化能力，适用于实时系统。

Abstract: Many real-time systems require the optimization of discrete variables.
Black-box optimization (BBO) algorithms and multi-armed bandit (MAB) algorithms
perform optimization by repeatedly taking actions and observing the
corresponding instant rewards without any prior knowledge. Recently, a BBO
method using an Ising machine has been proposed to find the best action that is
represented by a combination of discrete values and maximizes the instant
reward in static environments. In contrast, dynamic environments, where
real-time systems operate, necessitate MAB algorithms that maximize the average
reward over multiple trials. However, due to the enormous number of actions
resulting from the combinatorial nature of discrete optimization, conventional
MAB algorithms cannot effectively optimize dynamic, discrete environments.
Here, we show a heuristic MAB method for dynamic, discrete environments by
extending the BBO method, in which an Ising machine effectively explores the
actions while considering interactions between variables and changes in dynamic
environments. We demonstrate the dynamic adaptability of the proposed method in
a wireless communication system with moving users.

Result: 实验表明，MMFL在多种GTSP实例中显著优于现有方法，且保持实时计算效率。机器人测试验证了其实际效果。

Conclusion: MMFL框架在解决GTSP问题上表现出色，适用于实时机器人应用。

Abstract: Effective and efficient task planning is essential for mobile robots,
especially in applications like warehouse retrieval and environmental
monitoring. These tasks often involve selecting one location from each of
several target clusters, forming a Generalized Traveling Salesman Problem
(GTSP) that remains challenging to solve both accurately and efficiently. To
address this, we propose a Multimodal Fused Learning (MMFL) framework that
leverages both graph and image-based representations to capture complementary
aspects of the problem, and learns a policy capable of generating high-quality
task planning schemes in real time. Specifically, we first introduce a
coordinate-based image builder that transforms GTSP instances into spatially
informative representations. We then design an adaptive resolution scaling
strategy to enhance adaptability across different problem scales, and develop a
multimodal fusion module with dedicated bottlenecks that enables effective
integration of geometric and spatial features. Extensive experiments show that
our MMFL approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across
various GTSP instances while maintaining the computational efficiency required
for real-time robotic applications. Physical robot tests further validate its
practical effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: 该方法为开发高熟练度且风格多样的游戏AI提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: A wide variety of bots in games enriches the gameplay experience and enhances
replayability. Recent advancements in game artificial intelligence have
predominantly focused on improving the proficiency of bots. Nevertheless,
developing highly competent bots with a wide range of distinct play styles
remains a relatively under-explored area. We select the Mahjong game
environment as a case study. The high degree of randomness inherent in the
Mahjong game and the prevalence of out-of-distribution states lead to
suboptimal performance of existing offline learning and
Learning-from-Demonstration (LfD) algorithms. In this paper, we leverage the
gameplay histories of existing Mahjong agents and put forward a novel LfD
algorithm that necessitates only minimal modifications to the Proximal Policy
Optimization algorithm. The comprehensive empirical results illustrate that our
proposed method not only significantly enhances the proficiency of the agents
but also effectively preserves their unique play styles.

the use of defined classes and (b) a proposal of changes that allow BFO to
support functions, dispositions, and roles of generically dependent
continuants.

Motivation: LLMs在复杂数学推理中的多步FOL推理能力不足，尤其是在定理证明任务中表现较差。

Method: DREAM采用Axiom-Driven Strategy Diversification和Sub-Proposition Error Feedback机制，优化LLMs的推理策略。

Result: DREAM将性能提升了0.6%至6.4%，并提供了包含447个数学定理的数据集。

Conclusion: DREAM为LLMs在数学推理领域的应用提供了有效解决方案，尤其是在多步FOL任务中。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising first-order logic (FOL)
reasoning capabilities with applications in various areas. However, their
effectiveness in complex mathematical reasoning involving multi-step FOL
deductions is still under-researched. While LLMs perform competitively on
established mathematical reasoning benchmarks, they struggle with multi-step
FOL tasks, as demonstrated by Deepseek-Prover-V2-7B's low accuracy (4.2%) on
our proposed theorem proving dataset. This issue arises from the limited
exploration of diverse proof strategies and the potential for early reasoning
mistakes to undermine entire proofs. To address these issues, we propose DREAM,
a self-adaptive solution that enhances the Diversity and REAsonability of LLMs'
generation strategies. DREAM incorporates an Axiom-Driven Strategy
Diversification mechanism to promote varied strategic outcomes and a
Sub-Proposition Error Feedback to help LLMs reflect on and correct their
proofs. Our contributions include pioneering advancements in LLMs' mathematical
reasoning through FOL theorem proving, introducing a novel inference stage
solution that improves performance by 0.6% to 6.4%, and providing a curated
dataset of 447 mathematical theorems in Lean 4 format for evaluation.

Abstract: The creation of benchmarks to evaluate the safety of Large Language Models is
one of the key activities within the trusted AI community. These benchmarks
allow models to be compared for different aspects of safety such as toxicity,
bias, harmful behavior etc. Independent benchmarks adopt different approaches
with distinct data sets and evaluation methods. We investigate how robust such
benchmarks are by using different approaches to rank a set of representative
models for bias and compare how similar are the overall rankings. We show that
different but widely used bias evaluations methods result in disparate model
rankings. We conclude with recommendations for the community in the usage of
such benchmarks.

<details>

Motivation: 当前大型推理模型在数学问题上的高准确率掩盖了其真实推理缺陷，需通过数学证明的严谨性揭示这些不足。

Method: 引入RFMDataset（200个数学证明问题），评估高级模型表现，并分析其失败案例。

Result: 发现10种错误类型，显示模型在数学证明中表现不佳（正确率<20%），存在推理不严谨、幻觉和不完整等问题。

Conclusion: 模型的自反思不足以解决逻辑困境，需进行形式化和细粒度的逻辑训练。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (e.g., R1, o3) have demonstrated remarkable
mathematical problem-solving abilities. However, the high reported accuracy of
these advanced models on popular datasets, reliance on purely numerical
evaluation and potential benchmark leakage, often masks their true reasoning
shortcomings. To address this, we propose leveraging the inherent rigor and
methodological complexity of mathematical proofs as a diagnostic tool to expose
these hidden failures. Specifically, we introduce the RFMDataset (Reveal
Failure Modes), a collection of 200 diverse mathematical proof problems, and
thoroughly evaluate advanced models' performance on it. Our in-depth analysis
of their failures uncovers 10 fine-grained error types, which shows fundamental
limitations in current large reasoning models: 1) large reasoning models
grapple profoundly with mathematical proofs, with some generating entirely
correct proofs for less than 20% of problems and failing even on basic ones; 2)
models exhibit a diverse spectrum of reasoning failures, prominently
demonstrating the lack of guarantees for the correctness and rigor of
single-step reasoning; and 3) models show hallucination and incompleteness
during the reasoning process. Our findings reveal that models' self-reflection
is insufficient to resolve the current logical dilemmas, necessitating
formalized and fine-grained logical training.

Motivation: 研究模型无关RL在何种条件下会通过“思考”策略最大化奖励，因为“思考”行为既不直接产生奖励，也不改变外部世界状态。

Method: 引入“思考MDP”理论模型，证明策略初始化对“思考”行为的重要性，并验证开源LLM满足理论条件。

Result: 理论预测和实验验证表明，模型无关RL可以产生类似思考的行为，且在特定条件下能提升数据效率。

Conclusion: 论文为理解模型无关RL中“思考”行为的产生提供了理论基础，并展示了其在语言生成以外的潜在应用。

Abstract: Recent work on large language models has demonstrated the use of model-free
reinforcement learning (RL) to train reasoning-like capabilities. The emergence
of "thinking" through model-free RL is interesting as thinking actions neither
produce reward nor change the external world state to one where the agent is
more likely to get reward. This paper seeks to build a domain-independent
understanding of when model-free RL will lead to "thinking" as a strategy for
reward maximization. To build this understanding, we first introduce a
theoretical model which we call a \textit{thought Markov decision process}
(MDP). Thought MDPs minimally extend the classical MDP model to include an
abstract notion of thought state and thought action. Using the thought MDP
model, we prove the importance of policy initialization in determining whether
or not thinking emerges and show formally that thought actions are equivalent
to the agent choosing to perform a step of policy improvement before continuing
to act. We then show that open-source LLMs satisfy the conditions that our
theory predicts are necessary for model-free RL to produce thinking-like
behavior. Finally, we hypothesize sufficient conditions that would enable
thinking to be learned outside of language generation and introduce a toy
domain where a combination of multi-task pre-training and designated thought
actions enable more data-efficient RL compared to non-thinking agents.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在依赖分布式资源的复杂协作系统中，信任评估对任务完成至关重要，但由于网络动态性和信息收集延迟，全面评估设备信任度具有挑战性。

Method: 框架将信任评估分为多个链式阶段，每阶段仅收集相关设备属性数据，并利用生成式AI（如上下文学习、少样本学习和推理能力）快速分析数据。

Result: 实验结果表明，该框架在信任评估中实现了高准确性。

Conclusion: chain-of-trust框架通过分阶段和AI技术，显著提升了信任评估的效率和准确性。

Abstract: In collaborative systems with complex tasks relying on distributed resources,
trust evaluation of potential collaborators has emerged as an effective
mechanism for task completion. However, due to the network dynamics and varying
information gathering latencies, it is extremely challenging to observe and
collect all trust attributes of a collaborating device concurrently for a
comprehensive trust assessment. In this paper, a novel progressive trust
evaluation framework, namely chain-of-trust, is proposed to make better use of
misaligned device attribute data. This framework, designed for effective task
completion, divides the trust evaluation process into multiple chained stages
based on task decomposition. At each stage, based on the task completion
process, the framework only gathers the latest device attribute data relevant
to that stage, leading to reduced trust evaluation complexity and overhead. By
leveraging advanced in-context learning, few-shot learning, and reasoning
capabilities, generative AI is then employed to analyze and interpret the
collected data to produce correct evaluation results quickly. Only devices
deemed trustworthy at this stage proceed to the next round of trust evaluation.
The framework ultimately determines devices that remain trustworthy across all
stages. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves
high accuracy in trust evaluation.

Method: 构建MedPerturb数据集，包含800个临床情景，通过性别修改、风格变化和格式调整进行扰动，并比较LLMs与人类专家的反应。

Result: LLMs对性别和风格扰动更敏感，而人类专家对LLM生成的格式变化（如临床摘要）更敏感。

Conclusion: 需要超越静态基准的评估框架，以衡量LLMs与人类临床医生在临床变异性下的决策相似性。

Abstract: Clinical robustness is critical to the safe deployment of medical Large
Language Models (LLMs), but key questions remain about how LLMs and humans may
differ in response to the real-world variability typified by clinical settings.
To address this, we introduce MedPerturb, a dataset designed to systematically
evaluate medical LLMs under controlled perturbations of clinical input.
MedPerturb consists of clinical vignettes spanning a range of pathologies, each
transformed along three axes: (1) gender modifications (e.g., gender-swapping
or gender-removal); (2) style variation (e.g., uncertain phrasing or colloquial
tone); and (3) format changes (e.g., LLM-generated multi-turn conversations or
summaries). With MedPerturb, we release a dataset of 800 clinical contexts
grounded in realistic input variability, outputs from four LLMs, and three
human expert reads per clinical context. We use MedPerturb in two case studies
to reveal how shifts in gender identity cues, language style, or format reflect
diverging treatment selections between humans and LLMs. We find that LLMs are
more sensitive to gender and style perturbations while human annotators are
more sensitive to LLM-generated format perturbations such as clinical
summaries. Our results highlight the need for evaluation frameworks that go
beyond static benchmarks to assess the similarity between human clinician and
LLM decisions under the variability characteristic of clinical settings.

Conclusion: MEM1展示了推理驱动的记忆整合在长程交互任务中的潜力，优化了效率和性能。

Abstract: Modern language agents must operate over long-horizon, multi-turn
interactions, where they retrieve external information, adapt to observations,
and answer interdependent queries. Yet, most LLM systems rely on full-context
prompting, appending all past turns regardless of their relevance. This leads
to unbounded memory growth, increased computational costs, and degraded
reasoning performance on out-of-distribution input lengths. We introduce MEM1,
an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that enables agents to operate
with constant memory across long multi-turn tasks. At each turn, MEM1 updates a
compact shared internal state that jointly supports memory consolidation and
reasoning. This state integrates prior memory with new observations from the
environment while strategically discarding irrelevant or redundant information.
To support training in more realistic and compositional settings, we propose a
simple yet effective and scalable approach to constructing multi-turn
environments by composing existing datasets into arbitrarily complex task
sequences. Experiments across three domains, including internal retrieval QA,
open-domain web QA, and multi-turn web shopping, show that MEM1-7B improves
performance by 3.5x while reducing memory usage by 3.7x compared to
Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct on a 16-objective multi-hop QA task, and generalizes
beyond the training horizon. Our results demonstrate the promise of
reasoning-driven memory consolidation as a scalable alternative to existing
solutions for training long-horizon interactive agents, where both efficiency
and performance are optimized.

Method: 提出两种熵引导的预分词策略：1）利用点互信息和左右熵识别连贯字符片段；2）利用预训练GPT-2模型的预测熵检测边界不确定性。

Result: 在PKU数据集上实验显示，两种方法显著优于标准BPE，提升了分词性能。

Conclusion: 熵引导的预分词策略能更好地对齐语言学单元，为低资源或多语言场景的分词改进提供了方向。

Abstract: Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) has become a widely adopted subword tokenization
method in modern language models due to its simplicity and strong empirical
performance across downstream tasks. However, applying BPE to unsegmented
languages such as Chinese presents significant challenges, as its
frequency-driven merge operation is agnostic to linguistic boundaries. To
address this, we propose two entropy-informed pre-tokenization strategies that
guide BPE segmentation using unsupervised information-theoretic cues. The first
approach uses pointwise mutual information and left/right entropy to identify
coherent character spans, while the second leverages predictive entropy derived
from a pretrained GPT-2 model to detect boundary uncertainty. We evaluate both
methods on a subset of the PKU dataset and demonstrate substantial improvements
in segmentation precision, recall, and F1 score compared to standard BPE. Our
results suggest that entropy-guided pre-tokenization not only enhances
alignment with gold-standard linguistic units but also offers a promising
direction for improving tokenization quality in low-resource and multilingual
settings.

### [47] [Language Models can perform Single-Utterance Self-Correction of Perturbed Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15894)
*Sam Silver,Jimin Sun,Ivan Zhang,Sara Hooker,Eddie Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在数学推理方面表现出色，但对问题描述和提示策略的微小变化仍显脆弱。研究发现，LLMs具有内在的自我纠正能力，能够处理推理中的错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLMs在推理任务中的自我纠正能力，尤其是对Chain of Thought（CoT）推理中引入的合成扰动的处理能力。

Method: 通过实验测量模型对CoT推理中合成扰动的自我纠正能力，观察不同开放权重模型和数据集的自我纠正行为。

Result: 发现LLMs具有稳健的单次内在自我纠正能力，包括从隐式纠正到显式承认和修正错误。

Conclusion: LLMs可能具有比文献中通常显示的更强的内在自我纠正能力，这表明近期“推理”模型研究是对已有能力的放大。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive mathematical
reasoning capabilities, yet their performance remains brittle to minor
variations in problem description and prompting strategy. Furthermore,
reasoning is vulnerable to sampling-induced errors which autoregressive models
must primarily address using self-correction via additionally-generated tokens.
To better understand self-correction capabilities of recent models, we conduct
experiments measuring models' ability to self-correct synthetic perturbations
introduced into their Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning. We observe robust
single-utterance intrinsic self-correction behavior across a range of
open-weight models and datasets, ranging from subtle, implicit corrections to
explicit acknowledgments and corrections of errors. Our findings suggest that
LLMs, including those not finetuned for long CoT, may possess stronger
intrinsic self-correction capabilities than commonly shown in the literature.
The presence of this ability suggests that recent "reasoning" model work
involves amplification of traits already meaningfully present in models.

*Mohammad Amaan Sayeed,Mohammed Talha Alam,Raza Imam,Shahab Saquib Sohail,Amir Hussain*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种评估管道Tibbe-AG，用于验证基于伊斯兰医学文本的AI系统，通过检索和自我评估提升回答的准确性和文化敏感性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 伊斯兰医学文本如《医典》和《先知医学》蕴含丰富的预防和整体疗法，但未被现代AI系统充分利用，现有基准缺乏对文化医学指导的验证。

Method: 提出Tibbe-AG评估管道，结合30个精选问题、三种LLM模型（LLaMA-3、Mistral-7B、Qwen2-7B）和三种配置（直接生成、检索增强生成、科学自评过滤），并由代理LLM评估生成答案。

Result: 检索提升事实准确性13%，代理提示通过机制洞察和安全考量再提升10%，结合古典文本与检索和自我评估可实现可靠且文化敏感的医学问答。

Conclusion: 结合古典伊斯兰医学文本、检索技术和自我评估，能够实现可靠且文化敏感的医学问答系统。

Abstract: Centuries-old Islamic medical texts like Avicenna's Canon of Medicine and the
Prophetic Tibb-e-Nabawi encode a wealth of preventive care, nutrition, and
holistic therapies, yet remain inaccessible to many and underutilized in modern
AI systems. Existing language-model benchmarks focus narrowly on factual recall
or user preference, leaving a gap in validating culturally grounded medical
guidance at scale. We propose a unified evaluation pipeline, Tibbe-AG, that
aligns 30 carefully curated Prophetic-medicine questions with human-verified
remedies and compares three LLMs (LLaMA-3, Mistral-7B, Qwen2-7B) under three
configurations: direct generation, retrieval-augmented generation, and a
scientific self-critique filter. Each answer is then assessed by a secondary
LLM serving as an agentic judge, yielding a single 3C3H quality score.
Retrieval improves factual accuracy by 13%, while the agentic prompt adds
another 10% improvement through deeper mechanistic insight and safety
considerations. Our results demonstrate that blending classical Islamic texts
with retrieval and self-evaluation enables reliable, culturally sensitive
medical question-answering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估框架依赖传统指标而未验证其适用性，且改进摘要生成方法的研究尚不成熟。

Method: 通过人类标注构建测试集验证指标可靠性，比较传统指标与语言模型指标，并研究重排序和偏好调优方法。

Result: 语言模型指标优于传统指标，重排序和偏好调优方法显著提升摘要生成性能。

Conclusion: 研究为政治观点摘要的可靠评估和方法开发提供了贡献。

Abstract: Generating unbiased summaries in real-world settings such as political
perspective summarization remains a crucial application of Large Language
Models (LLMs). Yet, existing evaluation frameworks rely on traditional metrics
for measuring key attributes such as coverage and faithfulness without
verifying their applicability, and efforts to develop improved summarizers are
still nascent. We address these gaps by (1) identifying reliable metrics for
measuring perspective summary quality, and (2) investigating the efficacy of
LLM-based methods beyond zero-shot inference. Namely, we build a test set for
benchmarking metric reliability using human annotations and show that
traditional metrics underperform compared to language model-based metrics,
which prove to be strong evaluators. Using these metrics, we show that
reranking-based methods yield strong results, and preference tuning with
synthetically generated and reranking-labeled data further boosts performance.
Our findings aim to contribute to the reliable evaluation and development of
perspective summarization methods.

Abstract: Vietnamese, the 20th most spoken language with over 102 million native
speakers, lacks robust resources for key natural language processing tasks such
as text segmentation and machine reading comprehension (MRC). To address this
gap, we present VSMRC, the Vietnamese Text Segmentation and Multiple-Choice
Reading Comprehension Dataset. Sourced from Vietnamese Wikipedia, our dataset
includes 15,942 documents for text segmentation and 16,347 synthetic
multiple-choice question-answer pairs generated with human quality assurance,
ensuring a reliable and diverse resource. Experiments show that mBERT
consistently outperforms monolingual models on both tasks, achieving an
accuracy of 88.01% on MRC test set and an F1 score of 63.15\% on text

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI音乐生成工具的快速发展带来了检测挑战，现有基于音频或歌词的检测方法存在局限性。

Method: 采用多模态、模块化的后期融合管道，结合自动转录的歌词和音频中的语音特征。

Result: DE-detect优于现有基于歌词的检测器，且对音频扰动更鲁棒。

Conclusion: 该方法为实际场景中检测AI生成音乐提供了有效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI-based music generation tools is revolutionizing
the music industry but also posing challenges to artists, copyright holders,
and providers alike. This necessitates reliable methods for detecting such
AI-generated content. However, existing detectors, relying on either audio or
lyrics, face key practical limitations: audio-based detectors fail to
generalize to new or unseen generators and are vulnerable to audio
perturbations; lyrics-based methods require cleanly formatted and accurate
lyrics, unavailable in practice. To overcome these limitations, we propose a
novel, practically grounded approach: a multimodal, modular late-fusion
pipeline that combines automatically transcribed sung lyrics and speech
features capturing lyrics-related information within the audio. By relying on
lyrical aspects directly from audio, our method enhances robustness, mitigates
susceptibility to low-level artifacts, and enables practical applicability.
Experiments show that our method, DE-detect, outperforms existing lyrics-based
detectors while also being more robust to audio perturbations. Thus, it offers
an effective, robust solution for detecting AI-generated music in real-world
scenarios. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放长文本生成任务缺乏高质量参考数据，现有方法仅依赖通用评估信号，限制了准确性。

Method: 引入ProxyReward框架，包括自动生成数据集的方法和针对信息全面性与准确性的奖励信号计算。

Result: ProxyReward性能超越GPT-4-Turbo，提升开源模型在开放长文本生成任务上20%的性能。

Conclusion: ProxyReward为LLMs处理复杂开放问题提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Current research on long-form context in Large Language Models (LLMs)
primarily focuses on the understanding of long-contexts, the Open-ended Long
Text Generation (Open-LTG) remains insufficiently explored. Training a
long-context generation model requires curation of gold standard reference
data, which is typically nonexistent for informative Open-LTG tasks. However,
previous methods only utilize general assessments as reward signals, which
limits accuracy. To bridge this gap, we introduce ProxyReward, an innovative
reinforcement learning (RL) based framework, which includes a dataset and a
reward signal computation method. Firstly, ProxyReward Dataset generation is
accomplished through simple prompts that enables the model to create
automatically, obviating extensive labeled data or significant manual effort.
Secondly, ProxyReward Signal offers a targeted evaluation of information
comprehensiveness and accuracy for specific questions. The experimental results
indicate that our method ProxyReward surpasses even GPT-4-Turbo. It can
significantly enhance performance by 20% on the Open-LTG task when training
widely used open-source models, while also surpassing the LLM-as-a-Judge
approach. Our work presents effective methods to enhance the ability of LLMs to
address complex open-ended questions posed by human.

Motivation: 现代语言模型训练分为多个阶段，下游开发者难以评估每个阶段设计选择的影响。EvoLM旨在提供透明和系统的分析工具。

Method: 训练超过100个1B和4B参数的模型，评估上游语言建模和下游问题解决能力，包括领域内外泛化。

Result: 发现过度预训练和后期训练的收益递减、持续预训练的重要性、监督微调和强化学习的复杂权衡。

Conclusion: EvoLM为语言模型训练提供了透明分析工具，并开源了所有模型、数据集和训练评估流程。

Abstract: Modern language model (LM) training has been divided into multiple stages,
making it difficult for downstream developers to evaluate the impact of design
choices made at each stage. We present EvoLM, a model suite that enables
systematic and transparent analysis of LMs' training dynamics across
pre-training, continued pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement
learning. By training over 100 LMs with 1B and 4B parameters from scratch, we
rigorously evaluate both upstream (language modeling) and downstream
(problem-solving) reasoning capabilities, including considerations of both
in-domain and out-of-domain generalization. Key insights highlight the
diminishing returns from excessive pre-training and post-training, the
importance and practices of mitigating forgetting during domain-specific
continued pre-training, the crucial role of continued pre-training in bridging
pre-training and post-training phases, and various intricate trade-offs when
configuring supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. To facilitate
open research and reproducibility, we release all pre-trained and post-trained
models, training datasets for all stages, and our entire training and
evaluation pipeline.

Motivation: 现有推理时间扩展方法依赖外部验证器或未优化实际计算约束，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 提出DynScaling，结合并行-顺序采样策略和动态预算分配框架，优化计算资源分配。

Result: 实验显示DynScaling在任务性能和计算成本上均优于现有基线。

Conclusion: DynScaling有效解决了实际资源约束下的LLM性能提升问题。

Abstract: Inference-time scaling has proven effective in boosting large language model
(LLM) performance through increased test-time computation. Yet, its practical
application is often hindered by reliance on external verifiers or a lack of
optimization for realistic computational constraints. We propose DynScaling,
which addresses these limitations through two primary innovations: an
integrated parallel-sequential sampling strategy and a bandit-based dynamic
budget allocation framework. The integrated sampling strategy unifies parallel
and sequential sampling by constructing synthetic sequential reasoning chains
from initially independent parallel responses, promoting diverse and coherent
reasoning trajectories. The dynamic budget allocation framework formulates the
allocation of computational resources as a multi-armed bandit problem,
adaptively distributing the inference budget across queries based on the
uncertainty of previously sampled responses, thereby maximizing computational
efficiency. By combining these components, DynScaling effectively improves LLM
performance under practical resource constraints without the need for external
verifiers. Experimental results demonstrate that DynScaling consistently
surpasses existing verifier-free inference scaling baselines in both task
performance and computational cost.

Motivation: 网络欺凌问题日益严重，影响青少年心理健康，现有方法在检测效果和透明度上存在不足。

Method: 结合改进的DeBERTa模型（含Squeeze-and-Excitation块和情感分析）与GBLS分类器，形成混合架构。

Result: 在四个数据集上表现优异（HateXplain 79.3%，SOSNet 95.41%，Mendeley-I 91.37%，Mendeley-II 94.67%）。

Conclusion: 该框架性能优越且透明，但检测隐含偏见和讽刺内容仍有挑战，为未来改进提供方向。

Abstract: The proliferation of online communication platforms has created unprecedented
opportunities for global connectivity while simultaneously enabling harmful
behaviors such as cyberbullying, which affects approximately 54.4\% of
teenagers according to recent research. This paper presents a hybrid
architecture that combines the contextual understanding capabilities of
transformer-based models with the pattern recognition strengths of broad
learning systems for effective cyberbullying detection. This approach
integrates a modified DeBERTa model augmented with Squeeze-and-Excitation
blocks and sentiment analysis capabilities with a Gated Broad Learning System
(GBLS) classifier, creating a synergistic framework that outperforms existing
approaches across multiple benchmark datasets. The proposed ModifiedDeBERTa +
GBLS model achieved good performance on four English datasets: 79.3\% accuracy
on HateXplain, 95.41\% accuracy on SOSNet, 91.37\% accuracy on Mendeley-I, and
94.67\% accuracy on Mendeley-II. Beyond performance gains, the framework
incorporates comprehensive explainability mechanisms including token-level
attribution analysis, LIME-based local interpretations, and confidence
calibration, addressing critical transparency requirements in automated content
moderation. Ablation studies confirm the meaningful contribution of each
architectural component, while failure case analysis reveals specific
challenges in detecting implicit bias and sarcastic content, providing valuable
insights for future improvements in cyberbullying detection systems.

Result: 结果显示更深层次的Transformer在表达能力上更强，且理论预测了无位置编码的Transformer在序列依赖任务上的深度需求。

Conclusion: 结论是更深层次的Transformer确实具有更强的表达能力，且理论结果与实证数据一致。

Abstract: It has been observed that transformers with greater depth (that is, more
layers) have more capabilities, but can we establish formally which
capabilities are gained with greater depth? We answer this question with a
theoretical proof followed by an empirical study. First, we consider
transformers that round to fixed precision except inside attention. We show
that this subclass of transformers is expressively equivalent to the
programming language C-RASP and this equivalence preserves depth. Second, we
prove that deeper C-RASP programs are more expressive than shallower C-RASP
programs, implying that deeper transformers are more expressive than shallower
transformers (within the subclass mentioned above). These results are
established by studying a form of temporal logic with counting operators, which
was shown equivalent to C-RASP in previous work. Finally, we provide empirical
evidence that our theory predicts the depth required for transformers without
positional encodings to length-generalize on a family of sequential dependency
tasks.

Method: 提出自批判引导的好奇心优化提示策略，包含自批判和优化两个轻量级上下文步骤，无需额外训练。

Result: 在HONESET数据集上，使用H²框架评估，所有模型均表现提升，H²分数相对提高1.4%至4.3%。

Conclusion: 结构化自优化是一种可扩展且无需训练的策略，能有效提升大语言模型输出的可信度。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated robust capabilities across
various natural language tasks. However, producing outputs that are
consistently honest and helpful remains an open challenge. To overcome this
challenge, this paper tackles the problem through two complementary directions.
It conducts a comprehensive benchmark evaluation of ten widely used large
language models, including both proprietary and open-weight models from OpenAI,
Meta, and Google. In parallel, it proposes a novel prompting strategy,
self-critique-guided curiosity refinement prompting. The key idea behind this
strategy is enabling models to self-critique and refine their responses without
additional training. The proposed method extends the curiosity-driven prompting
strategy by incorporating two lightweight in-context steps including
self-critique step and refinement step.
  The experiment results on the HONESET dataset evaluated using the framework
$\mathrm{H}^2$ (honesty and helpfulness), which was executed with GPT-4o as a
judge of honesty and helpfulness, show consistent improvements across all
models. The approach reduces the number of poor-quality responses, increases
high-quality responses, and achieves relative gains in $\mathrm{H}^2$ scores
ranging from 1.4% to 4.3% compared to curiosity-driven prompting across
evaluated models. These results highlight the effectiveness of structured
self-refinement as a scalable and training-free strategy to improve the
trustworthiness of LLMs outputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数字通信平台的增长，网络欺凌事件增多，而现有检测系统主要针对单语言文本，难以处理Hinglish等混合语言内容。

Method: 使用MURIL架构，结合选择性层冻结、分类头设计和专门预处理方法，提升检测性能。

Result: 在六个基准数据集上，MURIL方法优于RoBERTa和IndicBERT，准确率提升1.36至13.07个百分点。

Conclusion: 该框架通过可解释性分析和跨语言模式识别，为未来多语言网络欺凌检测研究提供了方向。

Abstract: The growth of digital communication platforms has led to increased
cyberbullying incidents worldwide, creating a need for automated detection
systems to protect users. The rise of code-mixed Hindi-English (Hinglish)
communication on digital platforms poses challenges for existing cyberbullying
detection systems, which were designed primarily for monolingual text. This
paper presents a framework for cyberbullying detection in Hinglish text using
the Multilingual Representations for Indian Languages (MURIL) architecture to
address limitations in current approaches. Evaluation across six benchmark
datasets -- Bohra \textit{et al.}, BullyExplain, BullySentemo, Kumar \textit{et
al.}, HASOC 2021, and Mendeley Indo-HateSpeech -- shows that the MURIL-based
approach outperforms existing multilingual models including RoBERTa and
IndicBERT, with improvements of 1.36 to 13.07 percentage points and accuracies
of 86.97\% on Bohra, 84.62\% on BullyExplain, 86.03\% on BullySentemo, 75.41\%
on Kumar datasets, 83.92\% on HASOC 2021, and 94.63\% on Mendeley dataset. The
framework includes explainability features through attribution analysis and
cross-linguistic pattern recognition. Ablation studies show that selective
layer freezing, appropriate classification head design, and specialized
preprocessing for code-mixed content improve detection performance, while
failure analysis identifies challenges including context-dependent
interpretation, cultural understanding, and cross-linguistic sarcasm detection,
providing directions for future research in multilingual cyberbullying
detection.

TL;DR: FinCoT是一种结构化的思维链提示方法，结合领域专家知识提升大语言模型的推理能力，显著提高了金融问答任务的性能并降低了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有金融NLP研究主要关注标准或无结构的思维链提示，而结构化思维链提示的设计通常缺乏领域专家指导。FinCoT旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 研究比较了三种提示方法（标准、无结构CoT、结构化CoT）和FinCoT在CFA金融问题上的表现。FinCoT通过领域专家知识设计结构化推理步骤。

Result: FinCoT将性能从63.2%提升至80.5%，并减少生成令牌量八倍，同时提高推理的可解释性和专家对齐性。

Conclusion: 领域对齐的结构化提示不仅能提升性能、降低成本，还能生成更可解释的推理过程。

Abstract: This paper presents FinCoT, a structured chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting
approach that incorporates insights from domain-specific expert financial
reasoning to guide the reasoning traces of large language models. We
investigate that there are three main prompting styles in FinNLP: (1) standard
prompting--zero-shot prompting; (2) unstructured CoT--CoT prompting without an
explicit reasoning structure, such as the use of tags; and (3) structured CoT
prompting--CoT prompting with explicit instructions or examples that define
structured reasoning steps. Previously, FinNLP has primarily focused on prompt
engineering with either standard or unstructured CoT prompting. However,
structured CoT prompting has received limited attention in prior work.
Furthermore, the design of reasoning structures in structured CoT prompting is
often based on heuristics from non-domain experts. In this study, we
investigate each prompting approach in FinNLP. We evaluate the three main
prompting styles and FinCoT on CFA-style questions spanning ten financial
domains. We observe that FinCoT improves performance from 63.2% to 80.5% and
Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct from 69.7% to 74.2%, while reducing generated tokens
eight-fold compared to structured CoT prompting. Our findings show that
domain-aligned structured prompts not only improve performance and reduce
inference costs but also yield more interpretable and expert-aligned reasoning
traces.

of language shapes cognitive patterns, then large language models (LLMs)
trained on human language may also internalize the habitual logical structures
embedded in different languages. To examine this hypothesis, we introduce
BICAUSE, a structured bilingual dataset for causal reasoning, which includes
semantically aligned Chinese and English samples in both forward and reversed
causal forms. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) LLMs exhibit
typologically aligned attention patterns, focusing more on causes and
sentence-initial connectives in Chinese, while showing a more balanced
distribution in English. (2) Models internalize language-specific preferences
for causal word order and often rigidly apply them to atypical inputs, leading
to degraded performance, especially in Chinese. (3) When causal reasoning
succeeds, model representations converge toward semantically aligned
abstractions across languages, indicating a shared understanding beyond surface
form. Overall, these results suggest that LLMs not only mimic surface
linguistic forms but also internalize the reasoning biases shaped by language.
Rooted in cognitive linguistic theory, this phenomenon is for the first time
empirically verified through structural analysis of model internals.

*Guanhua Chen,Yutong Yao,Lidia S. Chao,Xuebo Liu,Derek F. Wong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SGIC的自引导迭代校准框架，通过利用不确定性分数提升大语言模型（LLMs）的校准能力，显著提高了多轮校准的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索增强生成（RAG）方法常忽视LLMs的校准能力，而LLMs具备强大的上下文推理能力。本文旨在通过提供特定提示来提升LLMs的校准效果。

Method: 提出SGIC框架，利用不确定性分数评估文档相关性和LLM响应置信度，并通过迭代重新评分结合先前响应优化校准。此外，引入自校准训练集构建方法，优化LLMs利用不确定性分数。

Result: SGIC框架显著提升了闭源和开源LLMs的性能。

Conclusion: 通过自引导迭代校准和不确定性分数的结合，SGIC框架有效提升了LLMs的校准能力和响应准确性。

Abstract: Recent research in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has concentrated on
retrieving useful information from candidate documents. However, numerous
methodologies frequently neglect the calibration capabilities of large language
models (LLMs), which capitalize on their robust in-context reasoning prowess.
This work illustrates that providing LLMs with specific cues substantially
improves their calibration efficacy, especially in multi-round calibrations. We
present a new SGIC: Self-Guided Iterative Calibration Framework that employs
uncertainty scores as a tool. Initially, this framework calculates uncertainty
scores to determine both the relevance of each document to the query and the
confidence level in the responses produced by the LLMs. Subsequently, it
reevaluates these scores iteratively, amalgamating them with prior responses to
refine calibration. Furthermore, we introduce an innovative approach for
constructing an iterative self-calibration training set, which optimizes LLMs
to efficiently harness uncertainty scores for capturing critical information
and enhancing response accuracy. Our proposed framework significantly improves
performance on both closed-source and open-weight LLMs.

Abstract: In this work, we propose JETHICS, a Japanese dataset for evaluating ethics
understanding of AI models. JETHICS contains 78K examples and is built by
following the construction methods of the existing English ETHICS dataset. It
includes four categories based normative theories and concepts from ethics and
political philosophy; and one representing commonsense morality. Our evaluation
experiments on non-proprietary large language models (LLMs) and on GPT-4o
reveal that even GPT-4o achieves only an average score of about 0.7, while the
best-performing Japanese LLM attains around 0.5, indicating a relatively large
room for improvement in current LLMs.

Conclusion: 弱标注数据可用于构建低资源语言的语音到文本翻译系统，为数据稀缺问题提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: The scarcity of high-quality annotated data presents a significant challenge
in developing effective end-to-end speech-to-text translation (ST) systems,
particularly for low-resource languages. This paper explores the hypothesis
that weakly labeled data can be used to build ST models for low-resource
language pairs. We constructed speech-to-text translation datasets with the
help of bitext mining using state-of-the-art sentence encoders. We mined the
multilingual Shrutilipi corpus to build Shrutilipi-anuvaad, a dataset
comprising ST data for language pairs Bengali-Hindi, Malayalam-Hindi,
Odia-Hindi, and Telugu-Hindi. We created multiple versions of training data
with varying degrees of quality and quantity to investigate the effect of
quality versus quantity of weakly labeled data on ST model performance. Results
demonstrate that ST systems can be built using weakly labeled data, with
performance comparable to massive multi-modal multilingual baselines such as
SONAR and SeamlessM4T.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自动口语评估系统在多方面评估中未能充分利用内容相关性，且语法分析较为肤浅，缺乏详细的错误类型。

Method: 引入多方面的相关性模块整合问题、图像内容、范例和口语回答；使用高级语法错误校正（GEC）和详细标注提取细粒度语法错误特征。

Result: 实验表明，这些改进显著提升了内容相关性、语言使用和整体评估性能。

Conclusion: 使用更丰富、更细致的特征集有助于实现更全面的口语评估。

Abstract: Current automated speaking assessment (ASA) systems for use in multi-aspect
evaluations often fail to make full use of content relevance, overlooking image
or exemplar cues, and employ superficial grammar analysis that lacks detailed
error types. This paper ameliorates these deficiencies by introducing two novel
enhancements to construct a hybrid scoring model. First, a multifaceted
relevance module integrates question and the associated image content,
exemplar, and spoken response of an L2 speaker for a comprehensive assessment
of content relevance. Second, fine-grained grammar error features are derived
using advanced grammar error correction (GEC) and detailed annotation to
identify specific error categories. Experiments and ablation studies
demonstrate that these components significantly improve the evaluation of
content relevance, language use, and overall ASA performance, highlighting the
benefits of using richer, more nuanced feature sets for holistic speaking
assessment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型（LLM）的安全评估和审核工具主要偏向英语等高资源语言，其他语言未得到充分研究。

Method: 创建手动标注的波兰语安全分类数据集及对抗性扰动样本，评估不同规模和架构的LLM和分类器模型（如Llama-Guard-3-8B、HerBERT分类器和PLLuM）。

Result: 基于HerBERT的分类器在对抗条件下表现最优。

Conclusion: 研究填补了多语言安全评估的空白，并验证了HerBERT分类器在波兰语任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Despite increasing efforts to ensure the safety of large language models
(LLMs), most existing safety assessments and moderation tools remain heavily
biased toward English and other high-resource languages, leaving majority of
global languages underexamined. To address this gap, we introduce a manually
annotated benchmark dataset for language model safety classification in Polish.
We also create adversarially perturbed variants of these samples designed to
challenge model robustness. We conduct a series of experiments to evaluate
LLM-based and classifier-based models of varying sizes and architectures.
Specifically, we fine-tune three models: Llama-Guard-3-8B, a HerBERT-based
classifier (a Polish BERT derivative), and PLLuM, a Polish-adapted Llama-8B
model. We train these models using different combinations of annotated data and
evaluate their performance, comparing it against publicly available guard
models. Results demonstrate that the HerBERT-based classifier achieves the
highest overall performance, particularly under adversarial conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究MFC框架是否适用于非美国文化背景的新闻议题分析。

Method: 引入FrameNews-PT数据集，基于MFC框架进行多轮标注，并评估模型在跨域数据上的表现。

Result: MFC框架总体适用，但需小幅调整；部分框架使用较少，新议题依赖通用框架。

Conclusion: 跨文化框架应用需谨慎考虑。

Abstract: Frames capture aspects of an issue that are emphasized in a debate by
interlocutors and can help us understand how political language conveys
different perspectives and ultimately shapes people's opinions. The Media Frame
Corpus (MFC) is the most commonly used framework with categories and detailed
guidelines for operationalizing frames. It is, however, focused on a few
salient U.S. news issues, making it unclear how well these frames can capture
news issues in other cultural contexts. To explore this, we introduce
FrameNews-PT, a dataset of Brazilian Portuguese news articles covering
political and economic news and annotate it within the MFC framework. Through
several annotation rounds, we evaluate the extent to which MFC frames
generalize to the Brazilian debate issues. We further evaluate how fine-tuned
and zero-shot models perform on out-of-domain data. Results show that the 15
MFC frames remain broadly applicable with minor revisions of the guidelines.
However, some MFC frames are rarely used, and novel news issues are analyzed
using general 'fall-back' frames. We conclude that cross-cultural frame use
requires careful consideration.

hypothesis is that the positions of entities within a knowledge graph provide
important insights for relation extraction tasks. We conduct experiments on
multiple datasets, each varying in the number of relations, training examples,
and underlying knowledge graphs. Our results demonstrate that integrating
knowledge graph information significantly enhances performance, especially when
dealing with an imbalance in the number of training examples for each relation.
We evaluate the contribution of knowledge graph-based features by combining
established relation extraction methods with graph-aware Neural Bellman-Ford
networks. These features are tested in both supervised and zero-shot settings,

Motivation: 解决大规模封闭信息抽取中数百万实体和数百种关系的挑战，同时提升效率。

Method: 采用判别式方法，整合类型和实体特定信息，利用较小模型实现高效抽取。

Result: 性能优于现有生成模型，尤其在长尾关系上表现突出，效率更高。

Conclusion: 该方法为更准确高效的信息抽取技术提供了新方向。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for closed information extraction. The
method employs a discriminative approach that incorporates type and
entity-specific information to improve relation extraction accuracy,
particularly benefiting long-tail relations. Notably, this method demonstrates
superior performance compared to state-of-the-art end-to-end generative models.
This is especially evident for the problem of large-scale closed information
extraction where we are confronted with millions of entities and hundreds of
relations. Furthermore, we emphasize the efficiency aspect by leveraging
smaller models. In particular, the integration of type-information proves
instrumental in achieving performance levels on par with or surpassing those of
a larger generative model. This advancement holds promise for more accurate and
efficient information extraction techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是解决LLMs是否能够表示现实世界内容的问题，尤其是当它们的输入、输出和训练数据仅基于文本时。

Method: 采用结构对应理论分析LLMs的表示能力，并调查相关证据。

Result: 研究发现，仅存在LLMs与现实实体之间的结构对应不足以支持其表示能力，但如果这些对应关系在任务表现中发挥适当作用，则可能支持真实世界内容的表示。

Conclusion: 结论指出，LLMs的文本局限性可能阻碍其在适当任务中的表现，但若能克服这一挑战，结构对应关系可能成为其表示现实世界内容的基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 produce compelling responses to a
wide range of prompts. But their representational capacities are uncertain.
Many LLMs have no direct contact with extra-linguistic reality: their inputs,
outputs and training data consist solely of text, raising the questions (1) can
LLMs represent anything and (2) if so, what? In this paper, I explore what it
would take to answer these questions according to a structural-correspondence
based account of representation, and make an initial survey of this evidence. I
argue that the mere existence of structural correspondences between LLMs and
worldly entities is insufficient to ground representation of those entities.
However, if these structural correspondences play an appropriate role - they
are exploited in a way that explains successful task performance - then they
could ground real world contents. This requires overcoming a challenge: the
text-boundedness of LLMs appears, on the face of it, to prevent them engaging
in the right sorts of tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统TTS系统在控制副语言信息（如音色、情感、韵律）时灵活性不足，且缺乏高质量基准和自动评估指标。

Method: 引入InstructTTSEval基准，包含三个任务（声学参数指定、描述性风格指令、角色扮演），共6k测试用例，并利用Gemini作为自动评估工具。

Result: 评估显示当前指令驱动的TTS系统仍有较大改进空间。

Conclusion: InstructTTSEval有望推动更强大、灵活、准确的指令驱动TTS系统的发展。

Abstract: In modern speech synthesis, paralinguistic information--such as a speaker's
vocal timbre, emotional state, and dynamic prosody--plays a critical role in
conveying nuance beyond mere semantics. Traditional Text-to-Speech (TTS)
systems rely on fixed style labels or inserting a speech prompt to control
these cues, which severely limits flexibility. Recent attempts seek to employ
natural-language instructions to modulate paralinguistic features,
substantially improving the generalization of instruction-driven TTS models.
Although many TTS systems now support customized synthesis via textual
description, their actual ability to interpret and execute complex instructions
remains largely unexplored. In addition, there is still a shortage of
high-quality benchmarks and automated evaluation metrics specifically designed
for instruction-based TTS, which hinders accurate assessment and iterative
optimization of these models. To address these limitations, we introduce
InstructTTSEval, a benchmark for measuring the capability of complex
natural-language style control. We introduce three tasks, namely
Acoustic-Parameter Specification, Descriptive-Style Directive, and Role-Play,
including English and Chinese subsets, each with 1k test cases (6k in total)
paired with reference audio. We leverage Gemini as an automatic judge to assess
their instruction-following abilities. Our evaluation of accessible
instruction-following TTS systems highlights substantial room for further
improvement. We anticipate that InstructTTSEval will drive progress toward more
powerful, flexible, and accurate instruction-following TTS.

Conclusion: RiOT有效解决了提示优化的多样性和语义漂移问题，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have highlighted their
potential across a variety of tasks, but their performance still heavily relies
on the design of effective prompts. Existing methods for automatic prompt
optimization face two challenges: lack of diversity, limiting the exploration
of valuable and innovative directions and semantic drift, where optimizations
for one task can degrade performance in others. To address these issues, we
propose Residual Optimization Tree (RiOT), a novel framework for automatic
prompt optimization. RiOT iteratively refines prompts through text gradients,
generating multiple semantically diverse candidates at each step, and selects
the best prompt using perplexity. Additionally, RiOT incorporates the text
residual connection to mitigate semantic drift by selectively retaining
beneficial content across optimization iterations. A tree structure efficiently
manages the optimization process, ensuring scalability and flexibility.
Extensive experiments across five benchmarks, covering commonsense,
mathematical, logical, temporal, and semantic reasoning, demonstrate that RiOT
outperforms both previous prompt optimization methods and manual prompting.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多模型协作标注的新范式AutoAnnotator，通过结合LLMs和SLMs的优势，显著降低了标注成本并提高了准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在大规模标注中成本高昂及在细粒度语义理解任务中准确性不足的问题。

Method: 设计了两层框架：上层元控制器层利用LLMs选择SLMs并验证困难样本，下层任务专家层通过多模型投票进行标注，并通过持续学习策略优化SLMs。

Result: AutoAnnotator在零样本、单样本、CoT和多数投票设置中优于现有开源/API LLMs，标注成本降低74.15%，准确性提高6.21%。

Conclusion: AutoAnnotator为高效、低成本的大规模标注提供了可行方案，同时提升了准确性。

Abstract: Although the annotation paradigm based on Large Language Models (LLMs) has
made significant breakthroughs in recent years, its actual deployment still has
two core bottlenecks: first, the cost of calling commercial APIs in large-scale
annotation is very expensive; second, in scenarios that require fine-grained
semantic understanding, such as sentiment classification and toxicity
classification, the annotation accuracy of LLMs is even lower than that of
Small Language Models (SLMs) dedicated to this field. To address these
problems, we propose a new paradigm of multi-model cooperative annotation and
design a fully automatic annotation framework AutoAnnotator based on this.
Specifically, AutoAnnotator consists of two layers. The upper-level
meta-controller layer uses the generation and reasoning capabilities of LLMs to
select SLMs for annotation, automatically generate annotation code and verify
difficult samples; the lower-level task-specialist layer consists of multiple
SLMs that perform annotation through multi-model voting. In addition, we use
the difficult samples obtained by the secondary review of the meta-controller
layer as the reinforcement learning set and fine-tune the SLMs in stages
through a continual learning strategy, thereby improving the generalization of
SLMs. Extensive experiments show that AutoAnnotator outperforms existing
open-source/API LLMs in zero-shot, one-shot, CoT, and majority voting settings.
Notably, AutoAnnotator reduces the annotation cost by 74.15% compared to
directly annotating with GPT-3.5-turbo, while still improving the accuracy by
6.21%. Project page: https://github.com/Zhaiyuan-Ji/AutoAnnotator.

Motivation: 现有代码基准测试无法全面评估大型语言模型在竞赛级代码推理上的能力，因此需要更严格的测试工具。

Method: 引入OJBench，包含232个NOI和ICPC编程竞赛问题，对37种模型进行全面评估。

Result: 即使是先进的推理导向模型（如o4-mini和Gemini-2.5-pro-exp）在竞赛级问题上表现不佳。

Conclusion: 竞赛级代码推理对模型仍具挑战性，OJBench为评估提供了更严格的标准。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
significant progress in math and code reasoning capabilities. However, existing
code benchmark are limited in their ability to evaluate the full spectrum of
these capabilities, particularly at the competitive level. To bridge this gap,
we introduce OJBench, a novel and challenging benchmark designed to assess the
competitive-level code reasoning abilities of LLMs. OJBench comprises 232
programming competition problems from NOI and ICPC, providing a more rigorous
test of models' reasoning skills. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation using
OJBench on 37 models, including both closed-source and open-source models,
reasoning-oriented and non-reasoning-oriented models. Our results indicate that
even state-of-the-art reasoning-oriented models, such as o4-mini and
Gemini-2.5-pro-exp, struggle with highly challenging competition-level
problems. This highlights the significant challenges that models face in
competitive-level code reasoning.

TL;DR: 论文研究了将大语言模型（LLMs）应用于长文本的挑战，提出了一个理论框架，将长上下文任务的失败模式分为三类，并通过实验验证了多代理分块方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在处理长文本时面临的挑战，如跨块依赖、模型噪声和聚合噪声。

Method: 提出理论框架分析长上下文任务的失败模式，并通过多代理分块方法（将长序列分为小块并聚合结果）进行实验验证。

Result: 实验表明，多代理分块方法在检索、问答和摘要等任务中有效，且对于大型输入，配置分块处理的较弱模型可能优于单次处理的先进模型（如GPT4o）。

Conclusion: 通过理论框架和实验，论文为处理长上下文任务提供了原则性指导，强调分块和聚合策略的重要性。

Abstract: We investigate the challenge of applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to long
texts. We propose a theoretical framework that distinguishes the failure modes
of long context tasks into three categories: cross-chunk dependence (task
noise), confusion that grows with context size (model noise), and the imperfect
integration of partial results (aggregator noise). Under this view, we analyze
when it is effective to use multi-agent chunking, i.e., dividing a length
sequence into smaller chunks and aggregating the processed results of each
chunk. Our experiments on tasks such as retrieval, question answering, and
summarization confirm both the theoretical analysis and the conditions that
favor multi-agent chunking. By exploring superlinear model noise growth with
input length, we also explain why, for large inputs, a weaker model configured
with chunk-based processing can surpass a more advanced model like GPT4o
applied in a single shot. Overall, we present a principled understanding
framework and our results highlight a direct pathway to handling long contexts
in LLMs with carefully managed chunking and aggregator strategies.

TL;DR: 论文提出REIS系统，通过优化存储内处理技术（ISP）解决RAG中检索阶段的瓶颈问题，显著提升性能和能效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）的知识受限于训练数据，RAG通过外部知识库补充静态知识，但检索阶段成为瓶颈。现有ISP技术存在算法不匹配、未优化数据检索及硬件修改复杂等问题。

Method: REIS系统采用三种机制：1）优化数据库布局，链接向量与文档；2）ISP定制的数据分布技术；3）利用存储系统现有计算资源的ANNS引擎。

Result: 相比服务器级系统，REIS平均提升检索性能13倍，能效55倍。

Conclusion: REIS通过针对性优化，显著提升RAG检索阶段的效率和能效，为ISP技术在RAG中的应用提供新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face an inherent challenge: their knowledge is
confined to the data that they have been trained on. To overcome this issue,
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) complements the static training-derived
knowledge of LLMs with an external knowledge repository. RAG consists of three
stages: indexing, retrieval, and generation. The retrieval stage of RAG becomes
a significant bottleneck in inference pipelines. In this stage, a user query is
mapped to an embedding vector and an Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS)
algorithm searches for similar vectors in the database to identify relevant
items. Due to the large database sizes, ANNS incurs significant data movement
overheads between the host and the storage system. To alleviate these
overheads, prior works propose In-Storage Processing (ISP) techniques that
accelerate ANNS by performing computations inside storage. However, existing
works that leverage ISP for ANNS (i) employ algorithms that are not tailored to
ISP systems, (ii) do not accelerate data retrieval operations for data selected
by ANNS, and (iii) introduce significant hardware modifications, limiting
performance and hindering their adoption. We propose REIS, the first ISP system
tailored for RAG that addresses these limitations with three key mechanisms.
First, REIS employs a database layout that links database embedding vectors to
their associated documents, enabling efficient retrieval. Second, it enables
efficient ANNS by introducing an ISP-tailored data placement technique that
distributes embeddings across the planes of the storage system and employs a
lightweight Flash Translation Layer. Third, REIS leverages an ANNS engine that
uses the existing computational resources inside the storage system. Compared
to a server-grade system, REIS improves the performance (energy efficiency) of
retrieval by an average of 13x (55x).

TL;DR: 论文提出StoryWriter框架，通过多代理系统解决长故事生成的连贯性和复杂性挑战，显著优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在生成长故事时面临连贯性和复杂性挑战，需改进。

Method: StoryWriter框架包含大纲代理、规划代理和写作代理，分别负责生成事件大纲、详细规划章节事件和动态生成连贯故事。

Result: StoryWriter在故事质量和长度上显著优于基线，并生成了6000篇高质量长故事数据集。

Conclusion: StoryWriter及其训练模型在长故事生成中表现出先进性能。

Abstract: Long story generation remains a challenge for existing large language models
(LLMs), primarily due to two main factors: (1) discourse coherence, which
requires plot consistency, logical coherence, and completeness in the long-form
generation, and (2) narrative complexity, which requires an interwoven and
engaging narrative. To address these challenges, we propose StoryWriter, a
multi-agent story generation framework, which consists of three main modules:
(1) outline agent, which generates event-based outlines containing rich event
plots, character, and event-event relationships. (2) planning agent, which
further details events and plans which events should be written in each chapter
to maintain an interwoven and engaging story. (3) writing agent, which
dynamically compresses the story history based on the current event to generate
and reflect new plots, ensuring the coherence of the generated story. We
conduct both human and automated evaluation, and StoryWriter significantly
outperforms existing story generation baselines in both story quality and
length. Furthermore, we use StoryWriter to generate a dataset, which contains
about $6,000$ high-quality long stories, with an average length of $8,000$
words. We train the model Llama3.1-8B and GLM4-9B using supervised fine-tuning
on LongStory and develop StoryWriter_GLM and StoryWriter_GLM, which
demonstrates advanced performance in long story generation.

Motivation: 隐式仇恨言论对社会媒体平台构成挑战，现有数据集可能未明确标注此类内容，且易受标注者主观影响。

Method: 方法包括关键样本识别、重新标注及使用Llama-3 70B和GPT-4o进行数据增强。

Result: 实验结果显示，F1分数比基线提高了12.9分。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了隐式仇恨言论的检测能力，具有跨数据集的泛化性。

Abstract: Implicit hate speech has recently emerged as a critical challenge for social
media platforms. While much of the research has traditionally focused on
harmful speech in general, the need for generalizable techniques to detect
veiled and subtle forms of hate has become increasingly pressing. Based on
lexicon analysis, we hypothesize that implicit hate speech is already present
in publicly available harmful speech datasets but may not have been explicitly
recognized or labeled by annotators. Additionally, crowdsourced datasets are
prone to mislabeling due to the complexity of the task and often influenced by
annotators' subjective interpretations. In this paper, we propose an approach
to address the detection of implicit hate speech and enhance generalizability
across diverse datasets by leveraging existing harmful speech datasets. Our
method comprises three key components: influential sample identification,
reannotation, and augmentation using Llama-3 70B and GPT-4o. Experimental
results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving implicit
hate detection, achieving a +12.9-point F1 score improvement compared to the
baseline.

TL;DR: RELIC是一种新颖的上下文学习框架，用于提升低资源印度语言的奖励模型准确性，通过从高资源语言中选择上下文示例来优化信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开源多语言奖励模型主要依赖高资源语言的偏好数据，导致低资源印度语言的奖励信号不可靠。

Method: RELIC通过训练一个检索器，从高资源语言中选择最能区分偏好和非偏好响应的上下文示例。

Result: 实验表明，RELIC显著提升了低资源印度语言的奖励模型准确性，例如在Bodo语言上比现有方法提高了12.81%。

Conclusion: RELIC为解决低资源语言奖励模型不可靠问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Reward models are essential for aligning large language models (LLMs) with
human preferences. However, most open-source multilingual reward models are
primarily trained on preference datasets in high-resource languages, resulting
in unreliable reward signals for low-resource Indic languages. Collecting
large-scale, high-quality preference data for these languages is prohibitively
expensive, making preference-based training approaches impractical. To address
this challenge, we propose RELIC, a novel in-context learning framework for
reward modeling in low-resource Indic languages. RELIC trains a retriever with
a pairwise ranking objective to select in-context examples from auxiliary
high-resource languages that most effectively highlight the distinction between
preferred and less-preferred responses. Extensive experiments on three
preference datasets- PKU-SafeRLHF, WebGPT, and HH-RLHF-using state-of-the-art
open-source reward models demonstrate that RELIC significantly improves reward
model accuracy for low-resource Indic languages, consistently outperforming
existing example selection methods. For example, on Bodo-a low-resource Indic
language-using a LLaMA-3.2-3B reward model, RELIC achieves a 12.81% and 10.13%
improvement in accuracy over zero-shot prompting and state-of-the-art example
selection method, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASR系统因偏向主流语言而难以识别区域方言，区域偏见研究不足。

Method: 采用两阶段分析：手动错误分析识别关键错误；案例研究分析方言代词识别。

Result: ASR错误与方言特征直接相关，社会因素影响较小。

Conclusion: 建议增加ASR训练数据的方言多样性，并利用社会语言学分析解决区域偏见。

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems struggle with regional dialects
due to biased training which favours mainstream varieties. While previous
research has identified racial, age, and gender biases in ASR, regional bias
remains underexamined. This study investigates ASR performance on Newcastle
English, a well-documented regional dialect known to be challenging for ASR. A
two-stage analysis was conducted: first, a manual error analysis on a subsample
identified key phonological, lexical, and morphosyntactic errors behind ASR
misrecognitions; second, a case study focused on the systematic analysis of ASR
recognition of the regional pronouns ``yous'' and ``wor''. Results show that
ASR errors directly correlate with regional dialectal features, while social
factors play a lesser role in ASR mismatches. We advocate for greater dialectal
diversity in ASR training data and highlight the value of sociolinguistic
analysis in diagnosing and addressing regional biases.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于因子化和中心化的持续学习方法，防止多语言语音识别模型在持续学习中出现灾难性遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代神经网络语音识别模型需持续吸收新数据而不重新训练整个系统，但在无原始数据、多语言和无语言依赖条件下容易发生灾难性遗忘。

Method: 受人类大脑通过醒睡周期学习和巩固知识的启发，提出两阶段方法：因子化阶段学习新知识，中心化阶段通过低秩适配器合并知识。

Result: 实验表明，中心化阶段能有效防止灾难性遗忘，通过分散的低秩适配器积累知识。

Conclusion: 该方法在多语言代码切换数据集上验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Modern neural network based speech recognition models are required to
continually absorb new data without re-training the whole system, especially in
downstream applications using foundation models, having no access to the
original training data. Continually training the models in a rehearsal-free,
multilingual, and language agnostic condition, likely leads to catastrophic
forgetting, when a seemingly insignificant disruption to the weights can
destructively harm the quality of the models. Inspired by the ability of human
brains to learn and consolidate knowledge through the waking-sleeping cycle, we
propose a continual learning approach with two distinct phases: factorization
and centralization, learning and merging knowledge accordingly. Our experiments
on a sequence of varied code-switching datasets showed that the centralization
stage can effectively prevent catastrophic forgetting by accumulating the
knowledge in multiple scattering low-rank adapters.

Conclusion: 首次实现流式口音转换系统，为实时应用提供可能。

Abstract: We propose a first streaming accent conversion (AC) model that transforms
non-native speech into a native-like accent while preserving speaker identity,
prosody and improving pronunciation. Our approach enables stream processing by
modifying a previous AC architecture with an Emformer encoder and an optimized
inference mechanism. Additionally, we integrate a native text-to-speech (TTS)
model to generate ideal ground-truth data for efficient training. Our streaming
AC model achieves comparable performance to the top AC models while maintaining
stable latency, making it the first AC system capable of streaming.

Motivation: 评估LLM是否具备结构化世界模型，以支持高风险应用中的可靠性。

Method: 提出框架，分解模型响应变异性为三部分：用户目的、表达方式和模型不稳定性，量化语义基础行为。

Result: 更大模型在用户目的变化上表现更稳健，但改进不均衡，优势有限。

Conclusion: 需超越准确性基准，采用语义诊断直接评估模型内部世界模型的结构和稳定性。

Abstract: Understanding whether large language models (LLMs) possess a world model-a
structured understanding of the world that supports generalization beyond
surface-level patterns-is central to assessing their reliability, especially in
high-stakes applications. We propose a formal framework for evaluating whether
an LLM exhibits a sufficiently robust world model, defined as producing
consistent outputs across semantically equivalent prompts while distinguishing
between prompts that express different intents. We introduce a new evaluation
approach to measure this that decomposes model response variability into three
components: variability due to user purpose, user articulation, and model
instability. An LLM with a strong world model should attribute most of the
variability in its responses to changes in foundational purpose rather than
superficial changes in articulation. This approach allows us to quantify how
much of a model's behavior is semantically grounded rather than driven by model
instability or alternative wording. We apply this framework to evaluate LLMs
across diverse domains. Our results show how larger models attribute a greater
share of output variability to changes in user purpose, indicating a more
robust world model. This improvement is not uniform, however: larger models do
not consistently outperform smaller ones across all domains, and their
advantage in robustness is often modest. These findings highlight the
importance of moving beyond accuracy-based benchmarks toward semantic
diagnostics that more directly assess the structure and stability of a model's
internal understanding of the world.

Abstract: Effectively engaging the public with science is vital for fostering trust and
understanding in our scientific community. Yet, with an ever-growing volume of
information, science communicators struggle to anticipate how audiences will
perceive and interact with scientific news. In this paper, we introduce a
computational framework that models public perception across twelve dimensions,
such as newsworthiness, importance, and surprisingness. Using this framework,
we create a large-scale science news perception dataset with 10,489 annotations
from 2,101 participants from diverse US and UK populations, providing valuable
insights into public responses to scientific information across domains. We
further develop NLP models that predict public perception scores with a strong
performance. Leveraging the dataset and model, we examine public perception of
science from two perspectives: (1) Perception as an outcome: What factors
affect the public perception of scientific information? (2) Perception as a
predictor: Can we use the estimated perceptions to predict public engagement
with science? We find that individuals' frequency of science news consumption
is the driver of perception, whereas demographic factors exert minimal
influence. More importantly, through a large-scale analysis and carefully
designed natural experiment on Reddit, we demonstrate that the estimated public
perception of scientific information has direct connections with the final
engagement pattern. Posts with more positive perception scores receive
significantly more comments and upvotes, which is consistent across different
scientific information and for the same science, but are framed differently.
Overall, this research underscores the importance of nuanced perception
modeling in science communication, offering new pathways to predict public
interest and engagement with scientific content.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管机器学习和LLM有进展，基于规则的NLP系统因其可解释性和操作效率仍在临床环境中使用，但其开发和维护成本高。

Method: 在规则系统开发阶段使用LLM，专注于从临床笔记中提取相关片段和关键词。

Result: 实验显示在提取临床相关片段（Deepseek: 0.98, Qwen: 0.99）和关键词（1.0）方面表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法为NLP开发提供了新方向，比深度学习方案更快、更经济且透明。

Abstract: Despite advances in machine learning (ML) and large language models (LLMs),
rule-based natural language processing (NLP) systems remain active in clinical
settings due to their interpretability and operational efficiency. However,
their manual development and maintenance are labor-intensive, particularly in
tasks with large linguistic variability. To overcome these limitations, we
proposed a novel approach employing LLMs solely during the rule-based systems
development phase. We conducted the initial experiments focusing on the first
two steps of developing a rule-based NLP pipeline: find relevant snippets from
the clinical note; extract informative keywords from the snippets for the
rule-based named entity recognition (NER) component. Our experiments
demonstrated exceptional recall in identifying clinically relevant text
snippets (Deepseek: 0.98, Qwen: 0.99) and 1.0 in extracting key terms for NER.
This study sheds light on a promising new direction for NLP development,
enabling semi-automated or automated development of rule-based systems with
significantly faster, more cost-effective, and transparent execution compared
with deep learning model-based solutions.

Conclusion: GeoGuess为多模态推理提供了新挑战，SightSense方法展示了其有效性。

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning is a process of understanding, integrating and inferring
information across different data modalities. It has recently attracted surging
academic attention as a benchmark for Artificial Intelligence (AI). Although
there are various tasks for evaluating multimodal reasoning ability, they still
have limitations. Lack of reasoning on hierarchical visual clues at different
levels of granularity, e.g., local details and global context, is of little
discussion, despite its frequent involvement in real scenarios. To bridge the
gap, we introduce a novel and challenging task for multimodal reasoning, namely
GeoGuess. Given a street view image, the task is to identify its location and
provide a detailed explanation. A system that succeeds in GeoGuess should be
able to detect tiny visual clues, perceive the broader landscape, and associate
with vast geographic knowledge. Therefore, GeoGuess would require the ability
to reason between hierarchical visual information and geographic knowledge. In
this work, we establish a benchmark for GeoGuess by introducing a specially
curated dataset GeoExplain which consists of
panoramas-geocoordinates-explanation tuples. Additionally, we present a
multimodal and multilevel reasoning method, namely SightSense which can make
prediction and generate comprehensive explanation based on hierarchy of visual
information and external knowledge. Our analysis and experiments demonstrate
their outstanding performance in GeoGuess.

Conclusion: ASEntmax和优化的位置编码能有效提升模型对固定大小模式的定位和泛化能力。

Abstract: Transformer-based architectures traditionally employ softmax to compute
attention weights, which produces dense distributions over all tokens in a
sequence. While effective in many settings, this density has been shown to be
detrimental for tasks that demand precise focus on fixed-size patterns: as
sequence length increases, non-informative tokens accumulate attention
probability mass, leading to dispersion and representational collapse. We show
in this paper that sparse attention mechanisms using $\alpha$-entmax can avoid
these issues, due to their ability to assign exact zeros to irrelevant tokens.
Furthermore, we introduce Adaptive-Scalable Entmax (ASEntmax), which endows
$\alpha$-entmax with a learnable temperature parameter, allowing the attention
distribution to interpolate between sparse (pattern-focused) and dense
(softmax-like) regimes. Finally, we show that the ability to locate and
generalize fixed-size patterns can be further improved through a careful design
of position encodings, which impacts both dense and sparse attention methods.
By integrating ASEntmax into standard transformer layers alongside proper
positional encodings, we show that our models greatly outperform softmax,
scalable softmax, and fixed-temperature $\alpha$-entmax baselines on
long-context generalization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种偏好对齐的路由框架Arch-Router，通过匹配查询到用户定义的领域或动作类型来优化LLM路由决策，支持动态添加新模型且无需重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM路由方法在评估性能和模型选择上存在局限，无法充分捕捉人类偏好和主观评价标准。

Method: 引入Arch-Router（1.5B模型），学习将查询映射到领域-动作偏好以指导路由决策，支持动态扩展模型池。

Result: 在对话数据集上实现了SOTA性能，优于顶级专有模型，且能捕捉主观评价标准。

Conclusion: Arch-Router提升了路由决策的透明度、灵活性，并支持动态扩展，为LLM路由提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) -- each
optimized for different strengths, style, or latency/cost profile -- routing
has become an essential technique to operationalize the use of different
models. However, existing LLM routing approaches are limited in two key ways:
they evaluate performance using benchmarks that often fail to capture human
preferences driven by subjective evaluation criteria, and they typically select
from a limited pool of models. In this work, we propose a preference-aligned
routing framework that guides model selection by matching queries to
user-defined domains (e.g., travel) or action types (e.g., image editing) --
offering a practical mechanism to encode preferences in routing decisions.
Specifically, we introduce \textbf{Arch-Router}, a compact 1.5B model that
learns to map queries to domain-action preferences for model routing decisions.
Our approach also supports seamlessly adding new models for routing without
requiring retraining or architectural modifications. Experiments on
conversational datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art
(SOTA) results in matching queries with human preferences, outperforming top
proprietary models. Our approach captures subjective evaluation criteria and
makes routing decisions more transparent and flexible. Our model is available

TL;DR: 研究发现，大型语言模型（LLMs）的语法探测能力与下游任务表现无关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs内部语法表示机制及其与下游任务表现的关系。

Method: 评估32个开源Transformer模型，比较语法探测特征与下游语法任务表现。

Result: 语法探测提取的特征无法预测下游语法任务表现。

Conclusion: 语法探测与下游任务表现存在显著脱节。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit a robust mastery of syntax when
processing and generating text. While this suggests internalized understanding
of hierarchical syntax and dependency relations, the precise mechanism by which
they represent syntactic structure is an open area within interpretability
research. Probing provides one way to identify the mechanism of syntax being
linearly encoded in activations, however, no comprehensive study has yet
established whether a model's probing accuracy reliably predicts its downstream
syntactic performance. Adopting a "mechanisms vs. outcomes" framework, we
evaluate 32 open-weight transformer models and find that syntactic features
extracted via probing fail to predict outcomes of targeted syntax evaluations
across English linguistic phenomena. Our results highlight a substantial
disconnect between latent syntactic representations found via probing and
observable syntactic behaviors in downstream tasks.

Motivation: 研究立法者政治意识形态对政策制定的影响。

Method: 使用LegiGPT框架，结合GPT-4和XAI技术，分析韩国第21届国会的交通相关提案。

Result: 保守派和进步派提案数量、选区规模及选民人口是关键影响因素。

Conclusion: LegiGPT为理解立法动态和指导政策发展提供了工具。

Abstract: Given the significant influence of lawmakers' political ideologies on
legislative decision-making, understanding their impact on policymaking is
critically important. We introduce a novel framework, LegiGPT, which integrates
a large language model (LLM) with explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to
analyze transportation-related legislative proposals. LegiGPT employs a
multi-stage filtering and classification pipeline using zero-shot prompting
with GPT-4. Using legislative data from South Korea's 21st National Assembly,
we identify key factors - including sponsor characteristics, political
affiliations, and geographic variables - that significantly influence
transportation policymaking. The LLM was used to classify
transportation-related bill proposals through a stepwise filtering process
based on keywords, phrases, and contextual relevance. XAI techniques were then
applied to examine relationships between party affiliation and associated
attributes. The results reveal that the number and proportion of conservative
and progressive sponsors, along with district size and electoral population,
are critical determinants shaping legislative outcomes. These findings suggest
that both parties contributed to bipartisan legislation through different forms
of engagement, such as initiating or supporting proposals. This integrated
approach provides a valuable tool for understanding legislative dynamics and
guiding future policy development, with broader implications for infrastructure
planning and governance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成奖励模型（GRMs）在捕捉人类偏好时更具灵活性，但推理能力不足导致推理路径不完整或过度推测，影响效果。

Method: ReasonGRM采用三阶段框架：1. Zero-RL生成简洁的推理路径；2. 引入新评估指标$R^\star$评分路径；3. 通过强化学习优化模型。

Result: 在三个公开基准测试中，ReasonGRM平均优于现有GRMs 1.8%，最高超越GPT-4o 5.6%。

Conclusion: ReasonGRM证明了推理感知训练的有效性，高质量推理路径选择对可靠偏好建模至关重要。

Abstract: Generative Reward Models (GRMs) provide greater flexibility than scalar
reward models in capturing human preferences, but their effectiveness is
limited by poor reasoning capabilities. This often results in incomplete or
overly speculative reasoning paths, leading to hallucinations or missing key
information in complex tasks. We address this challenge with ReasonGRM, a
three-stage generative reward modeling framework. In the first stage, Zero-RL
is used to generate concise, outcome-directed reasoning paths that reduce the
likelihood of critical omissions. In the second stage, we introduce a novel
evaluation metric, $R^\star$, which scores reasoning paths based on their
generation likelihood. This favors paths that reach correct answers with
minimal exploration, helping to reduce hallucination-prone data during
training. In the final stage, the model is further refined through
reinforcement learning on challenging examples to enhance its preference
discrimination capabilities. Experiments on three public benchmarks show that
ReasonGRM achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance, outperforming
previous best GRMs by 1.8\% on average and surpassing proprietary models such
as GPT-4o by up to 5.6\%. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of
reasoning-aware training and highlight the importance of high-quality rationale
selection for reliable preference modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在开放任务中的广泛应用，准确评估认知不确定性（反映模型知识不足）对确保可靠结果至关重要。然而，由于存在多答案的随机不确定性，量化认知不确定性具有挑战性。

Method: 通过在视觉问答（VQA）任务中进行实验，研究提示引入的偏差对GPT-4o和Qwen2-VL模型中认知和随机不确定性的影响。

Result: 研究发现，所有考虑的偏差在模型无偏置信度较低时对两种不确定性的影响更大。低无偏置信度会导致认知不确定性的低估（过度自信），但对随机不确定性的变化方向无显著影响。

Conclusion: 这些发现深化了对偏差缓解在不确定性量化中作用的理解，并为开发更先进的技术提供了潜在信息。

Abstract: With the growing adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) for open-ended
tasks, accurately assessing epistemic uncertainty, which reflects a model's
lack of knowledge, has become crucial to ensuring reliable outcomes. However,
quantifying epistemic uncertainty in such tasks is challenging due to the
presence of aleatoric uncertainty, which arises from multiple valid answers.
While bias can introduce noise into epistemic uncertainty estimation, it may
also reduce noise from aleatoric uncertainty. To investigate this trade-off, we
conduct experiments on Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks and find that
mitigating prompt-introduced bias improves uncertainty quantification in
GPT-4o. Building on prior work showing that LLMs tend to copy input information
when model confidence is low, we further analyze how these prompt biases affect
measured epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty across varying bias-free
confidence levels with GPT-4o and Qwen2-VL. We find that all considered biases
induce greater changes in both uncertainties when bias-free model confidence is
lower. Moreover, lower bias-free model confidence leads to greater
underestimation of epistemic uncertainty (i.e. overconfidence) due to bias,
whereas it has no significant effect on the direction of changes in aleatoric
uncertainty estimation. These distinct effects deepen our understanding of bias
mitigation for uncertainty quantification and potentially inform the
development of more advanced techniques.

Conclusion: LM-SPT通过语义蒸馏和架构改进，显著提升了语音标记化的效率和语义对齐性。

Abstract: With the rapid progress of speech language models (SLMs), discrete speech
tokens have emerged as a core interface between speech and text, enabling
unified modeling across modalities. Recent speech tokenization approaches aim
to isolate semantic information from low-level acoustics to better align with
language models. In particular, previous methods use SSL teachers such as
HuBERT to extract semantic representations, which are then distilled into a
semantic quantizer to suppress acoustic redundancy as well as capture
content-related latent structures. However, they still produce speech token
sequences significantly longer than their textual counterparts, creating
challenges for efficient speech-language modeling. Reducing the frame rate is a
natural solution, but standard techniques, such as rigid average pooling across
frames, can distort or dilute the semantic structure required for effective LM
alignment. To address this, we propose LM-SPT, a speech tokenization method
that introduces a novel semantic distillation. Instead of directly matching
teacher and student features via pooling, we reconstruct speech solely from
semantic tokens and minimize the discrepancy between the encoded
representations of the original and reconstructed waveforms, obtained from a
frozen automatic speech recognition (ASR) encoder. This indirect yet
data-driven supervision enables the tokenizer to learn discrete units that are
more semantically aligned with language models. LM-SPT further incorporates
architectural improvements to the encoder and decoder for speech tokenization,
and supports multiple frame rates, including 25Hz, 12.5Hz, and 6.25Hz.
Experimental results show that LM-SPT achieves superior reconstruction fidelity
compared to baselines, and that SLMs trained with LM-SPT tokens achieve
competitive performances on speech-to-text and consistently outperform
baselines on text-to-speech tasks.

Motivation: 在社交环境中，语言是强大的信息来源，尤其在需要整合多模态信息的新情境中。

Method: LIRAS结合多模态语言模型解析语言和视觉输入为统一符号表示，并通过贝叶斯逆规划引擎生成概率判断。

Result: 在多个社交推理任务中，LIRAS表现优于现有模型，更接近人类判断。

Conclusion: LIRAS为多模态社交推理提供了有效框架，尤其在语言和视觉信息整合方面表现突出。

Abstract: Drawing real world social inferences usually requires taking into account
information from multiple modalities. Language is a particularly powerful
source of information in social settings, especially in novel situations where
language can provide both abstract information about the environment dynamics
and concrete specifics about an agent that cannot be easily visually observed.
In this paper, we propose Language-Informed Rational Agent Synthesis (LIRAS), a
framework for drawing context-specific social inferences that integrate
linguistic and visual inputs. LIRAS frames multimodal social reasoning as a
process of constructing structured but situation-specific agent and environment
representations - leveraging multimodal language models to parse language and
visual inputs into unified symbolic representations, over which a Bayesian
inverse planning engine can be run to produce granular probabilistic judgments.
On a range of existing and new social reasoning tasks derived from cognitive
science experiments, we find that our model (instantiated with a comparatively
lightweight VLM) outperforms ablations and state-of-the-art models in capturing
human judgments across all domains.

Motivation: 现有方法忽视了ESC中固有的社交动态，导致模拟效果不佳。为了解决这一问题，作者提出了SocialSim框架。

Method: SocialSim通过构建全面的角色库（社交披露）和激发认知推理（社交意识）来模拟ESC，并生成了高质量的合成语料库SSConv。

Result: SSConv的质量甚至超过众包ESC数据，基于其训练的聊天机器人在自动和人工评估中表现最佳。

Conclusion: SocialSim为合成ESC提供了一种可扩展的方法，使情感关怀更易获得和实用。

Abstract: Emotional support conversation (ESC) helps reduce people's psychological
stress and provide emotional value through interactive dialogues. Due to the
high cost of crowdsourcing a large ESC corpus, recent attempts use large
language models for dialogue augmentation. However, existing approaches largely
overlook the social dynamics inherent in ESC, leading to less effective
simulations. In this paper, we introduce SocialSim, a novel framework that
simulates ESC by integrating key aspects of social interactions: social
disclosure and social awareness. On the seeker side, we facilitate social
disclosure by constructing a comprehensive persona bank that captures diverse
and authentic help-seeking scenarios. On the supporter side, we enhance social
awareness by eliciting cognitive reasoning to generate logical and supportive
responses. Building upon SocialSim, we construct SSConv, a large-scale
synthetic ESC corpus of which quality can even surpass crowdsourced ESC data.
We further train a chatbot on SSConv and demonstrate its state-of-the-art
performance in both automatic and human evaluations. We believe SocialSim
offers a scalable way to synthesize ESC, making emotional care more accessible
and practical.

Motivation: 现有黑盒越狱方法容易被检测且效率低，CAMO旨在提供更隐蔽和高效的攻击方式。

Method: CAMO将恶意提示分解为语义无害的视觉和文本片段，利用跨模态推理逐步重构有害指令。

Result: CAMO在主流多模态模型上表现出高效性和隐蔽性，且具有跨模型可迁移性。

Conclusion: 当前安全机制存在显著漏洞，亟需开发更先进的视觉语言系统安全解决方案。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate exceptional performance
across multimodal tasks, yet remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that bypass
built-in safety mechanisms to elicit restricted content generation. Existing
black-box jailbreak methods primarily rely on adversarial textual prompts or
image perturbations, yet these approaches are highly detectable by standard
content filtering systems and exhibit low query and computational efficiency.
In this work, we present Cross-modal Adversarial Multimodal Obfuscation (CAMO),
a novel black-box jailbreak attack framework that decomposes malicious prompts
into semantically benign visual and textual fragments. By leveraging LVLMs'
cross-modal reasoning abilities, CAMO covertly reconstructs harmful
instructions through multi-step reasoning, evading conventional detection
mechanisms. Our approach supports adjustable reasoning complexity and requires
significantly fewer queries than prior attacks, enabling both stealth and
efficiency. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on leading LVLMs validate
CAMO's effectiveness, showcasing robust performance and strong cross-model
transferability. These results underscore significant vulnerabilities in
current built-in safety mechanisms, emphasizing an urgent need for advanced,
alignment-aware security and safety solutions in vision-language systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer unprecedented opportunities to generate
concise summaries of patient information and alleviate the burden of clinical
documentation that overwhelms healthcare providers. We present Distillnote, a
framework for LLM-based clinical note summarization, and generate over 64,000
admission note summaries through three techniques: (1) One-step, direct
summarization, and a divide-and-conquer approach involving (2) Structured
summarization focused on independent clinical insights, and (3) Distilled
summarization that further condenses the Structured summaries. We test how
useful are the summaries by using them to predict heart failure compared to a
model trained on the original notes. Distilled summaries achieve 79% text
compression and up to 18.2% improvement in AUPRC compared to an LLM trained on
the full notes. We also evaluate the quality of the generated summaries in an
LLM-as-judge evaluation as well as through blinded pairwise comparisons with
clinicians. Evaluations indicate that one-step summaries are favoured by
clinicians according to relevance and clinical actionability, while distilled
summaries offer optimal efficiency (avg. 6.9x compression-to-performance ratio)
and significantly reduce hallucinations. We release our summaries on PhysioNet
to encourage future research.

Motivation: 尽管努力将LLMs与社会和道德价值观对齐，这些模型仍易受破解攻击。破解黑盒LLMs因离散输入、受限访问和有限查询预算而具挑战性。

Method: MIST通过顺序同义词搜索和顺序确定优化两种策略，迭代优化提示以平衡语义相似性和计算效率。

Result: 在多个开源和闭源模型上的实验表明，MIST在攻击成功率和可转移性上优于现有白盒和黑盒破解方法。

Conclusion: MIST是一种实用且高效的破解黑盒LLMs的方法，具有较高的攻击成功率和计算效率。

Abstract: Despite efforts to align large language models (LLMs) with societal and moral
values, these models remain susceptible to jailbreak attacks--methods designed
to elicit harmful responses. Jailbreaking black-box LLMs is considered
challenging due to the discrete nature of token inputs, restricted access to
the target LLM, and limited query budget. To address the issues above, we
propose an effective method for jailbreaking black-box large language Models
via Iterative Semantic Tuning, named MIST. MIST enables attackers to
iteratively refine prompts that preserve the original semantic intent while
inducing harmful content. Specifically, to balance semantic similarity with
computational efficiency, MIST incorporates two key strategies: sequential
synonym search, and its advanced version--order-determining optimization.
Extensive experiments across two open-source models and four closed-source
models demonstrate that MIST achieves competitive attack success rates and
attack transferability compared with other state-of-the-art white-box and
black-box jailbreak methods. Additionally, we conduct experiments on
computational efficiency to validate the practical viability of MIST.

Abstract: Sample efficiency is a crucial property of language models with practical
implications for training efficiency. In real-world text, information follows a
long-tailed distribution. Yet, we expect models to learn and recall frequent
and infrequent facts. Sample-efficient models are better equipped to handle
this challenge of learning and retaining rare information without requiring
excessive exposure. This study analyzes multiple models of varying
architectures and sizes, all trained on the same pre-training data. By
annotating relational facts with their frequencies in the training corpus, we
examine how model performance varies with fact frequency. Our findings show
that most models perform similarly on high-frequency facts but differ notably
on low-frequency facts. This analysis provides new insights into the
relationship between model architecture, size, and factual learning efficiency.

Motivation: 传统知识追踪方法依赖不透明的潜在嵌入，可解释性差；LLM方法可能生成不准确的预测或摘要。

Method: 将KT问题重新定义为逆问题，使用编码器LLM生成可解释的知识摘要，解码器LLM仅基于摘要预测学生回答。

Result: 在合成算术基准和Eedi数据集上，LBM的准确性媲美最先进的KT和LLM方法，且所需数据更少。

Conclusion: LBM通过自然语言瓶颈实现了高准确性和可解释性，且通过策略优化提升了摘要质量。

Abstract: Accurately assessing student knowledge is critical for effective education,
yet traditional Knowledge Tracing (KT) methods rely on opaque latent
embeddings, limiting interpretability. Even LLM-based approaches generate
direct predictions or summaries that may hallucinate without any accuracy
guarantees. We recast KT as an inverse problem: learning the minimum
natural-language summary that makes past answers explainable and future answers
predictable. Our Language Bottleneck Model (LBM) consists of an encoder LLM
that writes an interpretable knowledge summary and a frozen decoder LLM that
must reconstruct and predict student responses using only that summary text. By
constraining all predictive information to pass through a short
natural-language bottleneck, LBMs ensure that the summary contains accurate
information while remaining human-interpretable. Experiments on synthetic
arithmetic benchmarks and the large-scale Eedi dataset show that LBMs rival the
accuracy of state-of-the-art KT and direct LLM methods while requiring
orders-of-magnitude fewer student trajectories. We demonstrate that training
the encoder with group-relative policy optimization, using downstream decoding
accuracy as a reward signal, effectively improves summary quality.

Abstract: LaTeX's precision and flexibility in typesetting have made it the gold

regard and identify frequent error types. Our evaluation across open and

benchmarks perform poorly in LaTeX generation with a significant accuracy
drop-off as the complexity of tasks increases; open-source models like DeepSeek
v3 and DeepSeek Coder strongly rival closed-source counterparts in LaTeX tasks;
and formatting and package errors are unexpectedly prevalent, suggesting a lack

responses remains pertinent. To address this, we propose utilizing external
memory in the form of knowledge graphs, which are constructed and updated by
the LLM itself. We have expanded upon ideas of AriGraph architecture and for
the first time introduced a combined graph featuring both standard edges and
two types of hyperedges. Experiments conducted on the TriviaQA, HotpotQA and
DiaASQ benchmarks indicates that this approach aids in making the process of
graph construction and knowledge extraction unified and robust. Furthermore, we
augmented the DiaASQ benchmark by incorporating parameters such as time into
dialogues and introducing contradictory statements made by the same speaker at
different times. Despite these modifications, the performance of the
question-answering system remained robust, demonstrating the proposed
architecture's ability to maintain and utilize temporal dependencies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了LLM生成的解释性反馈对学习的影响，发现其效果取决于学习者的支持寻求倾向，部分课程显示显著学习收益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM生成反馈对学习的影响，尤其是在现有反馈方法基础上的补充作用。

Method: 比较三组学习者（接受GPT-3.5反馈、拒绝反馈和无访问组）的后测表现，使用倾向评分调整选择偏差。

Result: 两节课程中LLM反馈显示出中等学习效果（效应量0.28和0.33），且学习者评价积极。

Conclusion: LLM反馈是一种低成本、可扩展的学习改进工具，适用于开放任务，尤其在已有反馈系统中。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate feedback, yet
their impact on learning remains underexplored, especially compared to existing
feedback methods. This study investigates how on-demand LLM-generated
explanatory feedback influences learning in seven scenario-based tutor training
lessons. Analyzing over 2,600 lesson completions from 885 tutor learners, we
compare posttest performance among learners across three groups: learners who
received feedback generated by gpt-3.5-turbo, those who declined it, and those
without access. All groups received non-LLM corrective feedback. To address
potential selection bias-where higher-performing learners may be more inclined
to use LLM feedback-we applied propensity scoring. Learners with a higher
predicted likelihood of engaging with LLM feedback scored significantly higher
at posttest than those with lower propensity. After adjusting for this effect,
two out of seven lessons showed statistically significant learning benefits
from LLM feedback with standardized effect sizes of 0.28 and 0.33. These
moderate effects suggest that the effectiveness of LLM feedback depends on the
learners' tendency to seek support. Importantly, LLM feedback did not
significantly increase completion time, and learners overwhelmingly rated it as
helpful. These findings highlight LLM feedback's potential as a low-cost and
scalable way to improve learning on open-ended tasks, particularly in existing
systems already providing feedback without LLMs. This work contributes open
datasets, LLM prompts, and rubrics to support reproducibility.

Motivation: 现有基准测试忽视语言和视觉模糊性，无法充分利用模态间的相互澄清潜力。

Result: 19个先进多模态模型的评估显示与人类表现存在显著差距。

Conclusion: 未来需研究更复杂的跨模态模糊理解方法，推动多模态推理的边界。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
advances across numerous vision-language tasks. Due to their strong image-text
alignment capability, MLLMs can effectively understand image-text pairs with
clear meanings. However, effectively resolving the inherent ambiguities in
natural language and visual contexts remains challenging. Existing multimodal
benchmarks typically overlook linguistic and visual ambiguities, relying mainly
on unimodal context for disambiguation and thus failing to exploit the mutual
clarification potential between modalities. To bridge this gap, we introduce
MUCAR, a novel and challenging benchmark designed explicitly for evaluating
multimodal ambiguity resolution across multilingual and cross-modal scenarios.
MUCAR includes: (1) a multilingual dataset where ambiguous textual expressions
are uniquely resolved by corresponding visual contexts, and (2) a
dual-ambiguity dataset that systematically pairs ambiguous images with
ambiguous textual contexts, with each combination carefully constructed to
yield a single, clear interpretation through mutual disambiguation. Extensive
evaluations involving 19 state-of-the-art multimodal models--encompassing both
open-source and proprietary architectures--reveal substantial gaps compared to
human-level performance, highlighting the need for future research into more
sophisticated cross-modal ambiguity comprehension methods, further pushing the
boundaries of multimodal reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微调预训练LLMs通常牺牲通用能力，Tower+旨在解决这一问题，兼顾翻译和通用任务。

Method: 采用继续预训练、监督微调、偏好优化和强化学习，分阶段生成和筛选数据。

Result: 小模型优于大模型，最大模型在高资源语言翻译和通用任务中表现最佳。

Conclusion: Tower+证明在优化特定领域（如翻译）的同时，能匹敌前沿模型的通用能力。

Abstract: Fine-tuning pretrained LLMs has been shown to be an effective strategy for
reaching state-of-the-art performance on specific tasks like machine
translation. However, this process of adaptation often implies sacrificing
general-purpose capabilities, such as conversational reasoning and
instruction-following, hampering the utility of the system in real-world
applications that require a mixture of skills. In this paper, we introduce
Tower+, a suite of models designed to deliver strong performance across both
translation and multilingual general-purpose text capabilities. We achieve a
Pareto frontier between translation specialization and multilingual
general-purpose capabilities by introducing a novel training recipe that builds
on Tower (Alves et al., 2024), comprising continued pretraining, supervised
fine-tuning, preference optimization, and reinforcement learning with
verifiable rewards. At each stage of training, we carefully generate and curate
data to strengthen performance on translation as well as general-purpose tasks
involving code generation, mathematics problem solving, and general
instruction-following. We develop models at multiple scales: 2B, 9B, and 72B.
Our smaller models often outperform larger general-purpose open-weight and
proprietary LLMs (e.g., Llama 3.3 70B, GPT-4o). Our largest model delivers
best-in-class translation performance for high-resource languages and top
results in multilingual Arena Hard evaluations and in IF-MT, a benchmark we
introduce for evaluating both translation and instruction-following. Our
findings highlight that it is possible to rival frontier models in general
capabilities, while optimizing for specific business domains, such as
translation and localization.

Motivation: 探索CoT提示对LLM幻觉检测的影响，填补研究空白。

Method: 通过实验分析CoT提示对LLM内部状态和检测方法的影响。

Result: CoT提示减少幻觉频率，但削弱检测信号。

Conclusion: CoT提示在减少幻觉与检测效果之间存在权衡。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit \textit{hallucinations},
generating factually incorrect or semantically irrelevant content in response
to prompts. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting can mitigate hallucinations by
encouraging step-by-step reasoning, but its impact on hallucination detection
remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we conduct a systematic empirical
evaluation. We begin with a pilot experiment, revealing that CoT reasoning
significantly affects the LLM's internal states and token probability
distributions. Building on this, we evaluate the impact of various CoT
prompting methods on mainstream hallucination detection methods across both
instruction-tuned and reasoning-oriented LLMs. Specifically, we examine three
key dimensions: changes in hallucination score distributions, variations in
detection accuracy, and shifts in detection confidence. Our findings show that
while CoT prompting helps reduce hallucination frequency, it also tends to
obscure critical signals used for detection, impairing the effectiveness of
various detection methods. Our study highlights an overlooked trade-off in the
use of reasoning. Code is publicly available at:

Motivation: 研究语言模型反转能力对安全和问责的影响，如从API保护的语言模型中泄露私有信息。

Method: 提出PILS方法，利用语言模型的多步生成概率，通过线性映射压缩概率分布以恢复隐藏提示。

Result: PILS方法在恢复隐藏提示上比现有方法提升2-3.5倍，恢复率从17%提高到60%，并展示了良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 研究表明，语言模型的下一词概率是反转攻击的脆弱点，PILS方法在安全和问责方面具有重要意义。

Abstract: Language model inversion seeks to recover hidden prompts using only language
model outputs. This capability has implications for security and accountability
in language model deployments, such as leaking private information from an
API-protected language model's system message. We propose a new method --
prompt inversion from logprob sequences (PILS) -- that recovers hidden prompts
by gleaning clues from the model's next-token probabilities over the course of
multiple generation steps. Our method is enabled by a key insight: The
vector-valued outputs of a language model occupy a low-dimensional subspace.
This enables us to losslessly compress the full next-token probability
distribution over multiple generation steps using a linear map, allowing more
output information to be used for inversion. Our approach yields massive gains
over previous state-of-the-art methods for recovering hidden prompts, achieving
2--3.5 times higher exact recovery rates across test sets, in one case
increasing the recovery rate from 17% to 60%. Our method also exhibits
surprisingly good generalization behavior; for instance, an inverter trained on
16 generations steps gets 5--27 points higher prompt recovery when we increase
the number of steps to 32 at test time. Furthermore, we demonstrate strong
performance of our method on the more challenging task of recovering hidden
system messages. We also analyze the role of verbatim repetition in prompt
recovery and propose a new method for cross-family model transfer for
logit-based inverters. Our findings show that next-token probabilities are a
considerably more vulnerable attack surface for inversion attacks than
previously known.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种统一的指标*KV footprint*，用于评估语言模型中键值（KV）缓存的存储量和生命周期，揭示了现有KV驱逐方法的高峰值内存问题，并提出改进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型处理更长的上下文（如书籍摘要），KV缓存的内存成本增加，现有方法存在高峰值内存和性能下降问题，缺乏公平比较。

Method: 提出*KV footprint*作为统一指标，评估KV缓存的存储量和生命周期；改进*post-fill eviction*方法以支持预填充阶段的KV驱逐；提出PruLong方法优化注意力头的KV缓存需求。

Result: 改进后的方法显著降低了KV footprint，PruLong比现有方法减少12%的KV footprint，同时保持长上下文性能。

Conclusion: 论文通过统一指标和改进方法，为未来最小化KV footprint的研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Language models handle increasingly long contexts for tasks such as book
summarization, but this leads to growing memory costs for the key-value (KV)
cache. Many prior works have proposed ways of discarding KVs from memory, but
their approaches are tailored to favorable settings, obscuring caveats like
high peak memory and performance degradation, and a fair comparison between
methods is difficult. In this paper, we propose the *KV footprint* as a unified
metric, which accounts for both the amount of KV entries stored and their
lifespan in memory. We evaluate methods based on the smallest footprint they
attain while preserving performance in both long-context understanding and
generation, with context lengths of up to 128K tokens. This metric reveals the
high peak memory of prior KV eviction methods. One class of methods --
*post-fill eviction* -- has a high footprint due to being incompatible with
eviction during pre-filling. We adapt these methods to be able to evict KVs
during pre-filling, achieving substantially lower KV footprints. We then turn
to *recency eviction* methods, wherein we propose PruLong, an end-to-end
optimization method for learning which attention heads need to retain the full
KV cache and which do not. PruLong saves memory while preserving long-context
performance, achieving 12% smaller KV footprint than prior methods while
retaining performance in challenging recall tasks. Our paper clarifies the
complex tangle of long-context inference methods and paves the way for future
development to minimize the KV footprint.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CLEAR-3K是一个包含3000个断言-推理问题的数据集，用于评估语言模型是否能判断一个陈述是否因果解释另一个陈述。研究发现，语言模型常混淆语义相似性与因果关系，且随着参数增加，模型从过度怀疑转向过度接受因果关系，但性能提升有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估语言模型在区分语义相关性与真实因果解释关系方面的能力，为开发具备真实因果推理能力的模型提供基准。

Method: 通过CLEAR-3K数据集测试21种先进语言模型（参数从0.5B到72B），分析其对断言-推理对的判断能力。

Result: 语言模型常依赖词汇和语义重叠而非真实因果推理；参数增加导致模型从过度怀疑转向过度接受因果关系，但性能（MCC）最高仅0.55。

Conclusion: CLEAR-3K为开发具备真实因果推理能力的语言模型提供了关键基准，这对需要准确评估因果关系的应用至关重要。

Abstract: We introduce CLEAR-3K, a dataset of 3,000 assertion-reasoning questions
designed to evaluate whether language models can determine if one statement
causally explains another. Each question present an assertion-reason pair and
challenge language models to distinguish between semantic relatedness and
genuine causal explanatory relationships. Through comprehensive evaluation of
21 state-of-the-art language models (ranging from 0.5B to 72B parameters), we
identify two fundamental findings. First, language models frequently confuse
semantic similarity with causality, relying on lexical and semantic overlap
instead of inferring actual causal explanatory relationships. Second, as
parameter size increases, models tend to shift from being overly skeptical
about causal relationships to being excessively permissive in accepting them.
Despite this shift, performance measured by the Matthews Correlation
Coefficient plateaus at just 0.55, even for the best-performing models.Hence,
CLEAR-3K provides a crucial benchmark for developing and evaluating genuine
causal reasoning in language models, which is an essential capability for
applications that require accurate assessment of causal relationships.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the AI Search Paradigm, a comprehensive blueprint
for next-generation search systems capable of emulating human information
processing and decision-making. The paradigm employs a modular architecture of
four LLM-powered agents (Master, Planner, Executor and Writer) that dynamically
adapt to the full spectrum of information needs, from simple factual queries to
complex multi-stage reasoning tasks. These agents collaborate dynamically
through coordinated workflows to evaluate query complexity, decompose problems
into executable plans, and orchestrate tool usage, task execution, and content
synthesis. We systematically present key methodologies for realizing this
paradigm, including task planning and tool integration, execution strategies,
aligned and robust retrieval-augmented generation, and efficient LLM inference,
spanning both algorithmic techniques and infrastructure-level optimizations. By
providing an in-depth guide to these foundational components, this work aims to
inform the development of trustworthy, adaptive, and scalable AI search
systems.

Motivation: 微调LLM已成为常规操作，但会意外移除模型的安全对齐功能，即使数据无害。这一漏洞可能被恶意利用，亟需可靠的安全评估方法。

Method: 研究安全评估对实验设置微小变化及LLM随机性的鲁棒性，通过实验观察评估结果的方差。

Result: 安全评估结果对微调设置的微小变化表现出显著方差，影响结果的可比性。

Conclusion: 需改进安全评估的报告方式，以确保未来研究的可比性和可靠性。

Abstract: Fine-tuning a general-purpose large language model (LLM) for a specific
domain or task has become a routine procedure for ordinary users. However,
fine-tuning is known to remove the safety alignment features of the model, even
when the fine-tuning data does not contain any harmful content. We consider
this to be a critical failure mode of LLMs due to the widespread uptake of
fine-tuning, combined with the benign nature of the "attack". Most
well-intentioned developers are likely unaware that they are deploying an LLM
with reduced safety. On the other hand, this known vulnerability can be easily
exploited by malicious actors intending to bypass safety guardrails. To make
any meaningful progress in mitigating this issue, we first need reliable and
reproducible safety evaluations. In this work, we investigate how robust a
safety benchmark is to trivial variations in the experimental procedure, and
the stochastic nature of LLMs. Our initial experiments expose surprising
variance in the results of the safety evaluation, even when seemingly
inconsequential changes are made to the fine-tuning setup. Our observations
have serious implications for how researchers in this field should report
results to enable meaningful comparisons in the future.

Motivation: 现有AI生成的图标题缺乏个性化，难以匹配作者的写作风格和领域风格，因此需要多模态的个性化方法。

Method: 提出LaMP-Cap数据集，包含目标图的图像及其上下文（其他相关图及其标题和段落），用于训练和评估个性化标题生成模型。

Result: 实验表明，使用上下文信息（尤其是图像）能显著提升标题生成质量，使其更接近作者原版。

Conclusion: 多模态上下文信息（如图像）对个性化图标题生成至关重要，优于纯文本方法。

Abstract: Figure captions are crucial for helping readers understand and remember a
figure's key message. Many models have been developed to generate these
captions, helping authors compose better quality captions more easily. Yet,
authors almost always need to revise generic AI-generated captions to match
their writing style and the domain's style, highlighting the need for
personalization. Despite language models' personalization (LaMP) advances,
these technologies often focus on text-only settings and rarely address
scenarios where both inputs and profiles are multimodal. This paper introduces
LaMP-Cap, a dataset for personalized figure caption generation with multimodal
figure profiles. For each target figure, LaMP-Cap provides not only the needed
inputs, such as figure images, but also up to three other figures from the same
document--each with its image, caption, and figure-mentioning paragraphs--as a
profile to characterize the context. Experiments with four LLMs show that using
profile information consistently helps generate captions closer to the original
author-written ones. Ablation studies reveal that images in the profile are
more helpful than figure-mentioning paragraphs, highlighting the advantage of
using multimodal profiles over text-only ones.

Conclusion: 研究为多模态学习在点云补全任务中的发展提供了新视角，代码已开源。

Abstract: The single-view image guided point cloud completion (SVIPC) task aims to
reconstruct a complete point cloud from a partial input with the help of a
single-view image. While previous works have demonstrated the effectiveness of
this multimodal approach, the fundamental necessity of image guidance remains
largely unexamined. To explore this, we propose a strong baseline approach for
SVIPC based on an attention-based multi-branch encoder-decoder network that
only takes partial point clouds as input, view-free. Our hierarchical
self-fusion mechanism, driven by cross-attention and self-attention layers,
effectively integrates information across multiple streams, enriching feature
representations and strengthening the networks ability to capture geometric
structures. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on the ShapeNet-ViPC
dataset demonstrate that our view-free framework performs superiorly to
state-of-the-art SVIPC methods. We hope our findings provide new insights into
the development of multimodal learning in SVIPC. Our demo code will be

Method: VLMInferSlow结合了针对VLM推理的细粒度效率建模，并利用零阶优化搜索对抗样本。

Result: 实验表明，VLMInferSlow生成的对抗图像具有不可察觉的扰动，可将计算成本提高至128.47%。

Conclusion: 本研究旨在提高社区对VLM效率鲁棒性的关注。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated great potential in real-world
applications. While existing research primarily focuses on improving their
accuracy, the efficiency remains underexplored. Given the real-time demands of
many applications and the high inference overhead of VLMs, efficiency
robustness is a critical issue. However, previous studies evaluate efficiency
robustness under unrealistic assumptions, requiring access to the model
architecture and parameters -- an impractical scenario in ML-as-a-service
settings, where VLMs are deployed via inference APIs. To address this gap, we
propose VLMInferSlow, a novel approach for evaluating VLM efficiency robustness
in a realistic black-box setting. VLMInferSlow incorporates fine-grained
efficiency modeling tailored to VLM inference and leverages zero-order
optimization to search for adversarial examples. Experimental results show that
VLMInferSlow generates adversarial images with imperceptible perturbations,
increasing the computational cost by up to 128.47%. We hope this research
raises the community's awareness about the efficiency robustness of VLMs.

Abstract: Visual Language Navigation (VLN) is a fundamental task within the field of
Embodied AI, focusing on the ability of agents to navigate complex environments
based on natural language instructions. Despite the progress made by existing
methods, these methods often present some common challenges. First, they rely
on pre-trained backbone models for visual perception, which struggle with the
dynamic viewpoints in VLN scenarios. Second, the performance is limited when
using pre-trained LLMs or VLMs without fine-tuning, due to the absence of VLN
domain knowledge. Third, while fine-tuning LLMs and VLMs can improve results,
their computational costs are higher than those without fine-tuning. To address
these limitations, we propose Weakly-supervised Partial Contrastive Learning
(WPCL), a method that enhances an agent's ability to identify objects from
dynamic viewpoints in VLN scenarios by effectively integrating pre-trained VLM
knowledge into the perception process, without requiring VLM fine-tuning. Our
method enhances the agent's ability to interpret and respond to environmental
cues while ensuring computational efficiency. Experimental results have shown
that our method outperforms the baseline methods on multiple benchmarks, which
validate the effectiveness, robustness and generalizability of our method.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于学习的3D场景重建方法，利用LiDAR数据和深度神经网络构建静态符号距离函数（SDF）地图，以提高密集交通环境中的碰撞检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前技术在密集交通环境中难以精确导航，而3D场景重建在边界精度方面存在不足。符号距离函数（SDF）因其高效存储特性成为潜在解决方案。

Method: 结合LiDAR数据和深度神经网络，开发了一种学习型3D场景重建方法，生成静态SDF地图，替代传统的多边形表示。

Result: 初步结果表明，该方法能显著提升碰撞检测性能，尤其在拥挤和动态环境中。

Conclusion: 该方法为密集交通环境中的3D场景重建提供了更高效的解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: In crowded urban environments where traffic is dense, current technologies
struggle to oversee tight navigation, but surface-level understanding allows
autonomous vehicles to safely assess proximity to surrounding obstacles. 3D or
2D scene mapping of the surrounding objects is an essential task in addressing
the above problem. Despite its importance in dense vehicle traffic conditions,
3D scene reconstruction of object shapes with higher boundary level accuracy is
not yet entirely considered in current literature. The sign distance function
represents any shape through parameters that calculate the distance from any
point in space to the closest obstacle surface, making it more efficient in
terms of storage. In recent studies, researchers have started to formulate
problems with Implicit 3D reconstruction methods in the autonomous driving
domain, highlighting the possibility of using sign distance function to map
obstacles effectively. This research addresses this gap by developing a
learning-based 3D scene reconstruction methodology that leverages LiDAR data
and a deep neural network to build a the static Signed Distance Function (SDF)
maps. Unlike traditional polygonal representations, this approach has the
potential to map 3D obstacle shapes with more boundary-level details. Our
preliminary results demonstrate that this method would significantly enhance
collision detection performance, particularly in congested and dynamic
environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 雾天严重影响视觉信息，对自动驾驶和监控系统等安全关键应用构成挑战。

Method: 使用HDEN网络分类雾密度，动态路由至三个CORUN分支，结合自适应损失平衡物理模型和感知保真度。

Result: 在Cityscapes和RTTS基准上，PSNR提升2.1 dB，FADE降低30%，目标检测mAP提高13点，推理时间减少20%。

Conclusion: ADAM-Dehaze证明了雾密度特定处理和与下游视觉任务无缝集成的重要性。

Abstract: Adverse weather conditions, particularly fog, pose a significant challenge to
autonomous vehicles, surveillance systems, and other safety-critical
applications by severely degrading visual information. We introduce
ADAM-Dehaze, an adaptive, density-aware dehazing framework that jointly
optimizes image restoration and object detection under varying fog intensities.
A lightweight Haze Density Estimation Network (HDEN) classifies each input as
light, medium, or heavy fog. Based on this score, the system dynamically routes
the image through one of three CORUN branches: Light, Medium, or Complex, each
tailored to its haze regime. A novel adaptive loss balances physical-model
coherence and perceptual fidelity, ensuring both accurate defogging and
preservation of fine details. On Cityscapes and the real-world RTTS benchmark,
ADAM-Dehaze improves PSNR by up to 2.1 dB, reduces FADE by 30 percent, and
increases object detection mAP by up to 13 points, while cutting inference time
by 20 percent. These results highlight the importance of intensity-specific
processing and seamless integration with downstream vision tasks. Code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成模型局限于单镜头创作，而实际应用需要多镜头且身份一致、内容可控的解决方案。

Method: 提出EchoShot框架，采用镜头感知位置嵌入机制，构建PortraitGala数据集，支持多镜头训练和个性化生成。

Result: EchoShot在多镜头肖像视频生成中表现出优越的身份一致性和属性级可控性。

Conclusion: EchoShot为通用多镜头视频建模提供了潜在的基础范式。

Abstract: Video diffusion models substantially boost the productivity of artistic
workflows with high-quality portrait video generative capacity. However,
prevailing pipelines are primarily constrained to single-shot creation, while
real-world applications urge for multiple shots with identity consistency and
flexible content controllability. In this work, we propose EchoShot, a native
and scalable multi-shot framework for portrait customization built upon a
foundation video diffusion model. To start with, we propose shot-aware position
embedding mechanisms within video diffusion transformer architecture to model
inter-shot variations and establish intricate correspondence between multi-shot
visual content and their textual descriptions. This simple yet effective design
enables direct training on multi-shot video data without introducing additional
computational overhead. To facilitate model training within multi-shot
scenario, we construct PortraitGala, a large-scale and high-fidelity
human-centric video dataset featuring cross-shot identity consistency and
fine-grained captions such as facial attributes, outfits, and dynamic motions.
To further enhance applicability, we extend EchoShot to perform reference
image-based personalized multi-shot generation and long video synthesis with
infinite shot counts. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that EchoShot achieves
superior identity consistency as well as attribute-level controllability in
multi-shot portrait video generation. Notably, the proposed framework
demonstrates potential as a foundational paradigm for general multi-shot video
modeling.

Motivation: 希腊纸草文献的背景通常不均匀、碎片化且变色，传统二值化方法难以处理，因此需要探索深度学习方法及其数据增强技术的影响。

Method: 比较了传统二值化方法与深度学习模型，并评估了数据增强技术和不同模型选择标准的效果。实验在DIBCO 2019数据集上进行。

Result: 数据增强对深度学习方法有显著影响，且二值化效果与后续书写者识别性能高度相关。

Conclusion: 研究表明，高质量的图像二值化对书写者识别至关重要，深度学习方法结合数据增强可显著提升性能。

Abstract: This paper tackles the task of writer identification for Greek papyri. A
common preprocessing step in writer identification pipelines is image
binarization, which prevents the model from learning background features. This
is challenging in historical documents, in our case Greek papyri, as background
is often non-uniform, fragmented, and discolored with visible fiber structures.
We compare traditional binarization methods to state-of-the-art Deep Learning
(DL) models, evaluating the impact of binarization quality on subsequent writer
identification performance. DL models are trained with and without a custom
data augmentation technique, as well as different model selection criteria are
applied. The performance of these binarization methods, is then systematically
evaluated on the DIBCO 2019 dataset. The impact of binarization on writer
identification is subsequently evaluated using a state-of-the-art approach for
writer identification. The results of this analysis highlight the influence of
data augmentation for DL methods. Furthermore, findings indicate a strong
correlation between binarization effectiveness on papyri documents of DIBCO
2019 and downstream writer identification performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 路边AI摄像头在处理隐私敏感数据时存在滥用风险，传统模糊化方法无法完全保护隐私，因此需要更有效的解决方案。

Method: 采用反馈强化学习和视觉语言模型，将图像转换为语义等效的文本描述，并通过分层强化学习策略迭代优化文本生成。

Result: 相比现有方法，隐私保护和文本质量显著提升，独特词数增加约77%，细节密度提高约50%。

Conclusion: 该框架在保护隐私的同时保留了场景相关信息，为隐私敏感数据的处理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) rely on a range of devices that
often process privacy-sensitive data. Among these, roadside units play a
critical role particularly through the use of AI-equipped (AIE) cameras for
applications such as violation detection. However, the privacy risks associated
with captured imagery remain a major concern, as such data can be misused for
identity theft, profiling, or unauthorized commercial purposes. While
traditional techniques such as face blurring and obfuscation have been applied
to mitigate privacy risks, individual privacy remains at risk, as individuals
can still be tracked using other features such as their clothing. This paper
introduces a novel privacy-preserving framework that leverages feedback-based
reinforcement learning (RL) and vision-language models (VLMs) to protect
sensitive visual information captured by AIE cameras. The main idea is to
convert images into semantically equivalent textual descriptions, ensuring that
scene-relevant information is retained while visual privacy is preserved. A
hierarchical RL strategy is employed to iteratively refine the generated text,
enhancing both semantic accuracy and privacy. Evaluation results demonstrate
significant improvements in both privacy protection and textual quality, with
the Unique Word Count increasing by approximately 77\% and Detail Density by
around 50\% compared to existing approaches.

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了视觉语言模型（VLMs）如何通过内容无关的空间索引机制解决特征绑定问题，并揭示了其绑定错误的根源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究VLMs是否采用类似语言模型的符号化机制解决特征绑定问题，以解释其在绑定任务中的持续失败。

Method: 识别VLMs中支持绑定的内容无关空间索引机制，并分析绑定错误与这些机制的关系。

Result: 发现VLMs通过内容无关的空间索引机制实现绑定，且绑定错误源于这些机制的失效。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了VLMs中符号化处理的机制，为改进其绑定能力提供了方向。

Abstract: To accurately process a visual scene, observers must bind features together
to represent individual objects. This capacity is necessary, for instance, to
distinguish an image containing a red square and a blue circle from an image
containing a blue square and a red circle. Recent work has found that language
models solve this 'binding problem' via a set of symbol-like,
content-independent indices, but it is unclear whether similar mechanisms are
employed by vision language models (VLMs). This question is especially
relevant, given the persistent failures of VLMs on tasks that require binding.
Here, we identify a set of emergent symbolic mechanisms that support binding in
VLMs via a content-independent, spatial indexing scheme. Moreover, we find that
binding errors can be traced directly to failures in these mechanisms. Taken
together, these results shed light on the mechanisms that support symbol-like
processing in VLMs, and suggest possible avenues for addressing the persistent
binding failures exhibited by these models.

with acute pancreatitis (AP), chronic pancreatitis (CP), and healthy controls.
Methods: With IRB approval, we retrospectively collected 84 MRI scans (1.5T/3T
Siemens Aera/Verio) from children aged 2-19 years at Gazi University
(2015-2024). The dataset includes healthy children as well as patients

scans were obtained from 42 children with AP/CP (mean age: 11.73 +/- 3.9 years)
and 42 healthy children (mean age: 11.19 +/- 4.88 years). PanSegNet achieved
DSC scores of 88% (controls), 81% (AP), and 80% (CP), with HD95 values of 3.98
mm (controls), 9.85 mm (AP), and 15.67 mm (CP). Inter-observer kappa was 0.86
(controls), 0.82 (pancreatitis), and intra-observer agreement reached 0.88 and
0.81. Strong agreement was observed between automated and manual volumes (R^2 =
0.85 in controls, 0.77 in diseased), demonstrating clinical reliability.
Conclusion: PanSegNet represents the first validated deep learning solution for
pancreatic MRI segmentation, achieving expert-level performance across healthy
and diseased states. This tool, algorithm, along with our annotated dataset,
are freely available on GitHub and OSF, advancing accessible, radiation-free

Result: 框架结合了线性注意力的计算效率和生成模型的细化能力，显著提升了恢复性能。

Conclusion: 该混合框架有效解决了去摩尔纹中的非线性退化问题，优于现有方法。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for image and video demoir\'eing by
integrating Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation with advanced deep learning
techniques. Demoir\'eing addresses inherently nonlinear degradation processes,
which pose significant challenges for existing methods.
  Traditional supervised learning approaches either fail to remove moir\'e
patterns completely or produce overly smooth results. This stems from
constrained model capacity and scarce training data, which inadequately
represent the clean image distribution and hinder accurate reconstruction of
ground-truth images. While generative models excel in image restoration for
linear degradations, they struggle with nonlinear cases such as demoir\'eing
and often introduce artifacts.
  To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid MAP-based framework that
integrates two complementary components. The first is a supervised learning
model enhanced with efficient linear attention Test-Time Training (TTT)
modules, which directly learn nonlinear mappings for RAW-to-sRGB demoir\'eing.
The second is a Truncated Flow Matching Prior (TFMP) that further refines the
outputs by aligning them with the clean image distribution, effectively
restoring high-frequency details and suppressing artifacts. These two
components combine the computational efficiency of linear attention with the
refinement abilities of generative models, resulting in improved restoration
performance.

Result: VideoSync在公平实验条件下优于现有方法，并发现CNN模型在同步偏移预测中最有效。

Conclusion: VideoSync提升了视频同步的通用性和鲁棒性，适用于更广泛的实际应用。

Abstract: Video synchronization-aligning multiple video streams capturing the same
event from different angles-is crucial for applications such as reality TV show
production, sports analysis, surveillance, and autonomous systems. Prior work
has heavily relied on audio cues or specific visual events, limiting
applicability in diverse settings where such signals may be unreliable or
absent. Additionally, existing benchmarks for video synchronization lack
generality and reproducibility, restricting progress in the field. In this
work, we introduce VideoSync, a video synchronization framework that operates
independently of specific feature extraction methods, such as human pose
estimation, enabling broader applicability across different content types. We
evaluate our system on newly composed datasets covering single-human,
multi-human, and non-human scenarios, providing both the methodology and code
for dataset creation to establish reproducible benchmarks. Our analysis reveals
biases in prior SOTA work, particularly in SeSyn-Net's preprocessing pipeline,
leading to inflated performance claims. We correct these biases and propose a
more rigorous evaluation framework, demonstrating that VideoSync outperforms
existing approaches, including SeSyn-Net, under fair experimental conditions.
Additionally, we explore various synchronization offset prediction methods,
identifying a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based model as the most
effective. Our findings advance video synchronization beyond domain-specific
constraints, making it more generalizable and robust for real-world
applications.

Conclusion: PPMA通过结合ViTs和Mamba2的优势，显著提升了视觉任务的性能，证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Global dependency modeling and spatial position modeling are two core issues
of the foundational architecture design in current deep learning frameworks.
Recently, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved remarkable success in
computer vision, leveraging the powerful global dependency modeling capability
of the self-attention mechanism. Furthermore, Mamba2 has demonstrated its
significant potential in natural language processing tasks by explicitly
modeling the spatial adjacency prior through the structured mask. In this
paper, we propose Polyline Path Masked Attention (PPMA) that integrates the
self-attention mechanism of ViTs with an enhanced structured mask of Mamba2,
harnessing the complementary strengths of both architectures. Specifically, we
first ameliorate the traditional structured mask of Mamba2 by introducing a 2D
polyline path scanning strategy and derive its corresponding structured mask,
polyline path mask, which better preserves the adjacency relationships among
image tokens. Notably, we conduct a thorough theoretical analysis on the
structural characteristics of the proposed polyline path mask and design an
efficient algorithm for the computation of the polyline path mask. Next, we
embed the polyline path mask into the self-attention mechanism of ViTs,
enabling explicit modeling of spatial adjacency prior. Extensive experiments on
standard benchmarks, including image classification, object detection, and
segmentation, demonstrate that our model outperforms previous state-of-the-art
approaches based on both state-space models and Transformers. For example, our
proposed PPMA-T/S/B models achieve 48.7%/51.1%/52.3% mIoU on the ADE20K
semantic segmentation task, surpassing RMT-T/S/B by 0.7%/1.3%/0.3%,
respectively. Code is available at https://github.com/zhongchenzhao/PPMA.

Conclusion: LSB框架在异构模态无监督域适应中表现出色，为跨模态知识迁移提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods effectively bridge domain gaps
but become struggled when the source and target domains belong to entirely
distinct modalities. To address this limitation, we propose a novel setting
called Heterogeneous-Modal Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (HMUDA), which
enables knowledge transfer between completely different modalities by
leveraging a bridge domain containing unlabeled samples from both modalities.
To learn under the HMUDA setting, we propose Latent Space Bridging (LSB), a
specialized framework designed for the semantic segmentation task.
Specifically, LSB utilizes a dual-branch architecture, incorporating a feature
consistency loss to align representations across modalities and a domain
alignment loss to reduce discrepancies between class centroids across domains.
Extensive experiments conducted on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that LSB
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: LBMamba是一种局部双向状态空间模型，通过在正向扫描中嵌入轻量级反向扫描，避免了传统双向扫描的计算开销，提升了效率。LBVim是基于LBMamba构建的视觉骨干网络，在多个任务中表现出优越的性能与吞吐量平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mamba模型因其单向性限制了全局感知能力，传统双向扫描方法虽能解决但计算开销大。LBMamba旨在通过局部双向扫描消除额外计算负担。

Method: LBMamba在正向选择性扫描中嵌入轻量级局部反向扫描，完全在每线程寄存器中执行。LBVim通过交替扫描方向每两层恢复全局感知能力。

Result: LBVim在ImageNet-1K、ADE20K和COCO数据集上性能显著提升，病理图像分类任务中AUC、F1和准确率也有明显改进。

Conclusion: LBMamba和LBVim在保持高效的同时显著提升了模型性能，适用于多种视觉任务。

Abstract: Mamba, a State Space Model (SSM) that accelerates training by recasting
recurrence as a parallel selective scan, has recently emerged as a
linearly-scaling, efficient alternative to self-attention. Because of its
unidirectional nature, each state in Mamba only has information of its previous
states and is blind to states after. Current Mamba-based computer-vision
methods typically overcome this limitation by augmenting Mamba's global forward
scan with a global backward scan, forming a bi-directional scan that restores a
full receptive field. However, this operation doubles the computational load,
eroding much of the efficiency advantage that originally Mamba have. To
eliminate this extra scans, we introduce LBMamba, a locally bi-directional SSM
block that embeds a lightweight locally backward scan inside the forward
selective scan and executes it entirely in per-thread registers. Building on
LBMamba, we present LBVim, a scalable vision backbone that alternates scan
directions every two layers to recover a global receptive field without extra
backward sweeps. We validate the versatility of our approach on both natural
images and whole slide images (WSIs). We show that our LBVim constantly offers
a superior performance-throughput trade-off. That is under the same throughput,
LBVim achieves 0.8% to 1.6% higher top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet-1K
classification dataset, 0.6% to 2.7% higher mIoU on the ADE20K semantic
segmentation dataset, 0.9% higher APb and 1.1% higher APm on the COCO detection
dataset. We also integrate LBMamba into the SOTA pathology multiple instance
learning (MIL) approach, MambaMIL, which uses single directional scan.
Experiments on 3 public WSI classification datasets for show that our method
achieves a relative improvement of up to 3.06% better AUC, 3.39% better F1,
1.67% better accuracy.

Abstract: As the frontline data for cancer diagnosis, microscopic pathology images are
fundamental for providing patients with rapid and accurate treatment. However,
despite their practical value, the deep learning community has largely
overlooked their usage. This paper proposes a novel approach to classifying
microscopy images as time series data, addressing the unique challenges posed
by their manual acquisition and weakly labeled nature. The proposed method fits
image sequences of varying lengths to a fixed-length target by leveraging
Dynamic Time-series Warping (DTW). Attention-based pooling is employed to
predict the class of the case simultaneously. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach by comparing performance with various baselines and showcasing
the benefits of using various inference strategies in achieving stable and
reliable results. Ablation studies further validate the contribution of each
component. Our approach contributes to medical image analysis by not only
embracing microscopic images but also lifting them to a trustworthy level of

Abstract: Sign Language Video Generation (SLVG) seeks to generate identity-preserving
sign language videos from spoken language texts. Existing methods primarily
rely on the single coarse condition (\eg, skeleton sequences) as the
intermediary to bridge the translation model and the video generation model,
which limits both the naturalness and expressiveness of the generated videos.
To overcome these limitations, we propose SignViP, a novel SLVG framework that
incorporates multiple fine-grained conditions for improved generation fidelity.
Rather than directly translating error-prone high-dimensional conditions,
SignViP adopts a discrete tokenization paradigm to integrate and represent
fine-grained conditions (\ie, fine-grained poses and 3D hands). SignViP
contains three core components. (1) Sign Video Diffusion Model is jointly
trained with a multi-condition encoder to learn continuous embeddings that
encapsulate fine-grained motion and appearance. (2) Finite Scalar Quantization
(FSQ) Autoencoder is further trained to compress and quantize these embeddings
into discrete tokens for compact representation of the conditions. (3)
Multi-Condition Token Translator is trained to translate spoken language text
to discrete multi-condition tokens. During inference, Multi-Condition Token
Translator first translates the spoken language text into discrete
multi-condition tokens. These tokens are then decoded to continuous embeddings
by FSQ Autoencoder, which are subsequently injected into Sign Video Diffusion
Model to guide video generation. Experimental results show that SignViP
achieves state-of-the-art performance across metrics, including video quality,
temporal coherence, and semantic fidelity. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文分析了视觉地点识别（VPR）系统在对抗攻击下的脆弱性，提出了一种结合对抗攻击检测器（AAD）的系统框架，并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VPR系统在对抗攻击下缺乏防御能力，可能导致机器人导航灾难性后果，因此需要研究如何提升其安全性。

Method: 分析了四种常见对抗攻击和四种VPR特有攻击对定位性能的影响，提出结合AAD的系统框架，并通过实验验证其效果。

Result: 实验表明，加入AAD能显著提升性能（如沿轨定位误差减少50%），并首次研究了FGSM攻击在VPR中的效果。

Conclusion: 研究强调了AAD在实际系统中的必要性，并为系统设计提供了量化要求。

Abstract: Stand-alone Visual Place Recognition (VPR) systems have little defence
against a well-designed adversarial attack, which can lead to disastrous
consequences when deployed for robot navigation. This paper extensively
analyzes the effect of four adversarial attacks common in other perception
tasks and four novel VPR-specific attacks on VPR localization performance. We
then propose how to close the loop between VPR, an Adversarial Attack Detector
(AAD), and active navigation decisions by demonstrating the performance benefit
of simulated AADs in a novel experiment paradigm -- which we detail for the
robotics community to use as a system framework. In the proposed experiment
paradigm, we see the addition of AADs across a range of detection accuracies
can improve performance over baseline; demonstrating a significant improvement
-- such as a ~50% reduction in the mean along-track localization error -- can
be achieved with True Positive and False Positive detection rates of only 75%
and up to 25% respectively. We examine a variety of metrics including:
Along-Track Error, Percentage of Time Attacked, Percentage of Time in an
`Unsafe' State, and Longest Continuous Time Under Attack. Expanding further on
these results, we provide the first investigation into the efficacy of the Fast
Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) adversarial attack for VPR. The analysis in this
work highlights the need for AADs in real-world systems for trustworthy
navigation, and informs quantitative requirements for system design.

Result: 在DARPA-USGS数据集上评估显示高准确性，显著加速了地理空间数据集的生成。

Conclusion: DIGMAPPER成功部署于USGS，支持国家关键矿产评估和更广泛的地球科学应用。

Abstract: Historical geologic maps contain rich geospatial information, such as rock
units, faults, folds, and bedding planes, that is critical for assessing
mineral resources essential to renewable energy, electric vehicles, and
national security. However, digitizing maps remains a labor-intensive and
time-consuming task. We present DIGMAPPER, a modular, scalable system developed
in collaboration with the United States Geological Survey (USGS) to automate
the digitization of geologic maps. DIGMAPPER features a fully dockerized,
workflow-orchestrated architecture that integrates state-of-the-art deep
learning models for map layout analysis, feature extraction, and
georeferencing. To overcome challenges such as limited training data and
complex visual content, our system employs innovative techniques, including
in-context learning with large language models, synthetic data generation, and
transformer-based models. Evaluations on over 100 annotated maps from the
DARPA-USGS dataset demonstrate high accuracy across polygon, line, and point
feature extraction, and reliable georeferencing performance. Deployed at USGS,
DIGMAPPER significantly accelerates the creation of analysis-ready geospatial
datasets, supporting national-scale critical mineral assessments and broader
geoscientific applications.

Motivation: 内窥镜场景中光照变化和纹理稀疏对深度估计和自运动估计的挑战，现有方法在多模块训练策略上仍有不足。

Method: 提出多步高效微调框架，分三步训练：光流注册、多尺度图像分解和多变换对齐，避免无关信息干扰。

Result: 在SCARED和Hamlyn数据集上实现自监督深度估计和零样本深度估计的最优性能，误差降低4%~10%。

Conclusion: 多步微调框架有效解决了内窥镜场景中的深度估计问题，性能显著提升，代码已开源。

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation and ego-motion estimation are significant tasks
for scene perception and navigation in stable, accurate and efficient
robot-assisted endoscopy. To tackle lighting variations and sparse textures in
endoscopic scenes, multiple techniques including optical flow, appearance flow
and intrinsic image decomposition have been introduced into the existing
methods. However, the effective training strategy for multiple modules are
still critical to deal with both illumination issues and information
interference for self-supervised depth estimation in endoscopy. Therefore, a
novel framework with multistep efficient finetuning is proposed in this work.
In each epoch of end-to-end training, the process is divided into three steps,
including optical flow registration, multiscale image decomposition and
multiple transformation alignments. At each step, only the related networks are
trained without interference of irrelevant information. Based on
parameter-efficient finetuning on the foundation model, the proposed method
achieves state-of-the-art performance on self-supervised depth estimation on
SCARED dataset and zero-shot depth estimation on Hamlyn dataset, with
4\%$\sim$10\% lower error. The evaluation code of this work has been published

Motivation: 视觉生成中注意力机制的二次复杂度导致高计算和内存成本，尤其是在高分辨率图像或多帧视频生成中。现有技术如稀疏化和量化在低密度和低比特宽度下面临挑战。

Method: 提出PARO技术，通过重新组织注意力模式为硬件友好的块状模式，简化并增强稀疏化和量化。最终设计PAROAttention方法。

Result: PAROAttention在低密度（20%-30%）和低比特宽度（INT8/INT4）下实现无损指标，与全精度基线结果几乎相同，端到端延迟加速1.9x至2.7x。

Conclusion: PAROAttention通过重新组织注意力模式，显著降低了计算和内存成本，同时保持了生成质量，为高效视觉生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: In visual generation, the quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms
results in high memory and computational costs, especially for longer token
sequences required in high-resolution image or multi-frame video generation. To
address this, prior research has explored techniques such as sparsification and
quantization. However, these techniques face significant challenges under low
density and reduced bitwidths. Through systematic analysis, we identify that
the core difficulty stems from the dispersed and irregular characteristics of
visual attention patterns. Therefore, instead of introducing specialized
sparsification and quantization design to accommodate such patterns, we propose
an alternative strategy: *reorganizing* the attention pattern to alleviate the
challenges. Inspired by the local aggregation nature of visual feature
extraction, we design a novel **Pattern-Aware token ReOrdering (PARO)**
technique, which unifies the diverse attention patterns into a
hardware-friendly block-wise pattern. This unification substantially simplifies
and enhances both sparsification and quantization. We evaluate the
performance-efficiency trade-offs of various design choices and finalize a
methodology tailored for the unified pattern. Our approach, **PAROAttention**,
achieves video and image generation with lossless metrics, and nearly identical
results from full-precision (FP) baselines, while operating at notably lower
density (~20%-30%) and bitwidth (**INT8/INT4**), achieving a **1.9x** to
**2.7x** end-to-end latency speedup.

Conclusion: OpenBench和OVSNet的有效性得到了验证，为开放词汇分割提供了更准确的评估和改进方法。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary segmentation aims to achieve segmentation of arbitrary
categories given unlimited text inputs as guidance. To achieve this, recent
works have focused on developing various technical routes to exploit the
potential of large-scale pre-trained vision-language models and have made
significant progress on existing benchmarks. However, we find that existing
test sets are limited in measuring the models' comprehension of
``open-vocabulary" concepts, as their semantic space closely resembles the
training space, even with many overlapping categories. To this end, we present
a new benchmark named OpenBench that differs significantly from the training
semantics. It is designed to better assess the model's ability to understand
and segment a wide range of real-world concepts. When testing existing methods
on OpenBench, we find that their performance diverges from the conclusions
drawn on existing test sets. In addition, we propose a method named OVSNet to
improve the segmentation performance for diverse and open scenarios. Through
elaborate fusion of heterogeneous features and cost-free expansion of the
training space, OVSNet achieves state-of-the-art results on both existing
datasets and our proposed OpenBench. Corresponding analysis demonstrate the
soundness and effectiveness of our proposed benchmark and method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低分辨率视频中的人体姿态估计存在挑战，传统方法要么依赖高质量输入，要么计算成本高，限制了在资源受限环境中的应用。

Method: 提出STAR-Pose框架，结合改进的时空Transformer和自适应融合模块，设计了姿态感知的复合损失函数。

Result: 在多个主流数据集上表现优异，低分辨率条件下mAP提升5.2%，推理速度比级联方法快2.8x至4.4x。

Conclusion: STAR-Pose在低分辨率视频中高效且准确地实现了人体姿态估计，为资源受限环境提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Human pose estimation in low-resolution videos presents a fundamental
challenge in computer vision. Conventional methods either assume high-quality
inputs or employ computationally expensive cascaded processing, which limits
their deployment in resource-constrained environments. We propose STAR-Pose, a
spatial-temporal adaptive super-resolution framework specifically designed for
video-based human pose estimation. Our method features a novel spatial-temporal
Transformer with LeakyReLU-modified linear attention, which efficiently
captures long-range temporal dependencies. Moreover, it is complemented by an
adaptive fusion module that integrates parallel CNN branch for local texture
enhancement. We also design a pose-aware compound loss to achieve task-oriented
super-resolution. This loss guides the network to reconstruct structural
features that are most beneficial for keypoint localization, rather than
optimizing purely for visual quality. Extensive experiments on several
mainstream video HPE datasets demonstrate that STAR-Pose outperforms existing
approaches. It achieves up to 5.2% mAP improvement under extremely
low-resolution (64x48) conditions while delivering 2.8x to 4.4x faster
inference than cascaded approaches.

Motivation: 现有方法在建模唇部运动时存在时间连续性的信息丢失问题，限制了性能。

Method: 提出TD3Net，结合密集跳跃连接和多扩张时间卷积，覆盖更广且无盲区的感受野。

Result: 在LRW和LRW-1000数据集上表现优异，参数和计算量更少。

Conclusion: TD3Net有效利用多样化时间特征并保持连续性，为唇读系统带来显著优势。

Abstract: The word-level lipreading approach typically employs a two-stage framework
with separate frontend and backend architectures to model dynamic lip
movements. Each component has been extensively studied, and in the backend
architecture, temporal convolutional networks (TCNs) have been widely adopted
in state-of-the-art methods. Recently, dense skip connections have been
introduced in TCNs to mitigate the limited density of the receptive field,
thereby improving the modeling of complex temporal representations. However,
their performance remains constrained owing to potential information loss
regarding the continuous nature of lip movements, caused by blind spots in the
receptive field. To address this limitation, we propose TD3Net, a temporal
densely connected multi-dilated convolutional network that combines dense skip
connections and multi-dilated temporal convolutions as the backend
architecture. TD3Net covers a wide and dense receptive field without blind
spots by applying different dilation factors to skip-connected features.
Experimental results on a word-level lipreading task using two large publicly
available datasets, Lip Reading in the Wild (LRW) and LRW-1000, indicate that
the proposed method achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art
methods. It achieved higher accuracy with fewer parameters and lower
floating-point operations compared to existing TCN-based backend architectures.
Moreover, visualization results suggest that our approach effectively utilizes
diverse temporal features while preserving temporal continuity, presenting
notable advantages in lipreading systems. The code is available at our GitHub

Motivation: 现有基于Transformer的方法隐式学习事件位置和语义，依赖大量训练数据且性能受限。

Method: 引入位置锚定查询和事件关系编码器，显式提供位置和关系先验。

Result: 在ActivityNet Captions和YouCook2数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: 显式位置和关系先验显著提升密集视频描述性能。

Abstract: Dense video captioning is a challenging task that aims to localize and
caption multiple events in an untrimmed video. Recent studies mainly follow the
transformer-based architecture to jointly perform the two sub-tasks, i.e.,
event localization and caption generation, in an end-to-end manner. Based on
the general philosophy of detection transformer, these methods implicitly learn
the event locations and event semantics, which requires a large amount of
training data and limits the model's performance in practice. In this paper, we
propose a novel dense video captioning framework, named PR-DETR, which injects
the explicit position and relation prior into the detection transformer to
improve the localization accuracy and caption quality, simultaneously. On the
one hand, we first generate a set of position-anchored queries to provide the
scene-specific position and semantic information about potential events as
position prior, which serves as the initial event search regions to eliminate
the implausible event proposals. On the other hand, we further design an event
relation encoder to explicitly calculate the relationship between event
boundaries as relation prior to guide the event interaction to improve the
semantic coherence of the captions. Extensive ablation studies are conducted to
verify the effectiveness of the position and relation prior. Experimental
results also show the competitive performance of our method on ActivityNet
Captions and YouCook2 datasets.

Motivation: 现有视觉提示方法依赖人工设计，效率低且性能不佳，需自动化优化提示选择。

Method: AutoV通过数据收集和标注管道，评估并排名视觉提示，训练模型自动选择最优提示。

Result: AutoV显著提升多种视觉语言模型的性能，如LLaVA-OV和Qwen2.5-VL。

Conclusion: AutoV是一种高效的视觉提示优化方法，适用于多种视觉语言任务。

Abstract: Inspired by text prompts in large language models (LLMs), visual prompts have
been explored to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large vision-language
models (LVLMs). Current methods design heuristic visual prompts, such as
overlaying a text-query-guided attention heatmap on the original input image.
However, designing effective prompts manually is challenging and
time-consuming, and it often fails to explore the benefits of different visual
prompts, leading to sub-optimal performance. To this end, we propose
\textbf{AutoV} that learns to automatically select the optimal visual prompt
from various candidates based on given textual queries and the input image. To
train AutoV, we developed an automatic data collection and labeling pipeline
that evaluates various visual prompts with a pre-trained LVLM. We input a set
of visual prompts into the LVLM and rank them according to the prediction
losses generated by the model. Using the ranking as a supervision signal, we
train AutoV to automatically choose the optimal visual prompt from various
visual prompts for LVLMs. Experimental results indicate that AutoV enhances the
performance of various LVLMs across multiple popular image understanding tasks.
For instance, LLaVA-OV with AutoV achieves $\textbf{1.7}\%$ accuracy gain on
LLaVA$^{\text{Wild}}$, and AutoV boosts Qwen2.5-VL by $\textbf{1.9}\%$ on MMMU,
highlighting its potential as an optimal visual prompting method for LVLMs.

Motivation: 现有方法（如FreeInit）通过迭代优化噪声提高时间一致性，但计算成本高。FastInit旨在消除迭代需求，提高效率。

Method: FastInit训练了一个视频噪声预测网络（VNPNet），输入随机噪声和文本提示，单次生成优化后的噪声。

Result: 实验表明，FastInit显著提升了生成视频的质量和时间一致性，且计算成本低。

Conclusion: FastInit为视频生成提供了一种高效实用的解决方案，可直接应用于推理阶段。

Abstract: Video generation has made significant strides with the development of
diffusion models; however, achieving high temporal consistency remains a
challenging task. Recently, FreeInit identified a training-inference gap and
introduced a method to iteratively refine the initial noise during inference.
However, iterative refinement significantly increases the computational cost
associated with video generation. In this paper, we introduce FastInit, a fast
noise initialization method that eliminates the need for iterative refinement.
FastInit learns a Video Noise Prediction Network (VNPNet) that takes random
noise and a text prompt as input, generating refined noise in a single forward
pass. Therefore, FastInit greatly enhances the efficiency of video generation
while achieving high temporal consistency across frames. To train the VNPNet,
we create a large-scale dataset consisting of pairs of text prompts, random
noise, and refined noise. Extensive experiments with various text-to-video
models show that our method consistently improves the quality and temporal
consistency of the generated videos. FastInit not only provides a substantial
improvement in video generation but also offers a practical solution that can
be applied directly during inference. The code and dataset will be released.

Conclusion: DeepObjectLog通过神经符号整合，实现了直接从原始数据学习对象表示，并在多种泛化场景中表现优异。

Abstract: Relational learning enables models to generalize across structured domains by
reasoning over objects and their interactions. While recent advances in
neurosymbolic reasoning and object-centric learning bring us closer to this
goal, existing systems rely either on object-level supervision or on a
predefined decomposition of the input into objects. In this work, we propose a
neurosymbolic formulation for learning object-centric representations directly
from raw unstructured perceptual data and using only distant supervision. We
instantiate this approach in DeepObjectLog, a neurosymbolic model that
integrates a perceptual module, which extracts relevant object representations,
with a symbolic reasoning layer based on probabilistic logic programming. By
enabling sound probabilistic logical inference, the symbolic component
introduces a novel learning signal that further guides the discovery of
meaningful objects in the input. We evaluate our model across a diverse range
of generalization settings, including unseen object compositions, unseen tasks,
and unseen number of objects. Experimental results show that our method
outperforms neural and neurosymbolic baselines across the tested settings.

Motivation: 现有方法（如GRPO）在多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）中缺乏严格的评估，且存在推理步骤与答案逻辑不一致的问题。

Method: 提出GRPO-CARE框架，结合基础答案正确性奖励和自适应一致性奖励，替代KL惩罚，优化推理路径。

Conclusion: GRPO-CARE为MLLMs提供了一种可泛化的后训练框架，推动了更可解释和鲁棒的模型发展。

Abstract: Recent reinforcement learning approaches, such as outcome-supervised GRPO,
have advanced Chain-of-Thought reasoning in large language models (LLMs), yet
their adaptation to multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) is unexplored. To address the lack
of rigorous evaluation for MLLM post-training methods, we introduce
SEED-Bench-R1, a benchmark with complex real-world videos requiring balanced
perception and reasoning. It offers a large training set and evaluates
generalization across three escalating challenges: in-distribution,
cross-environment, and cross-environment-task scenarios. Using SEED-Bench-R1,
we find that standard GRPO, while improving answer accuracy, often reduces
logical coherence between reasoning steps and answers, with only a 57.9%
consistency rate. This stems from reward signals focusing solely on final
answers, encouraging shortcuts, and strict KL penalties limiting exploration.To
address this, we propose GRPO-CARE, a consistency-aware RL framework optimizing
both answer correctness and reasoning coherence without explicit supervision.
GRPO-CARE introduces a two-tiered reward: (1) a base reward for answer
correctness, and (2) an adaptive consistency bonus, computed by comparing the
model's reasoning-to-answer likelihood (via a slowly-evolving reference model)
against group peers.This dual mechanism amplifies rewards for reasoning paths
that are both correct and logically consistent. Replacing KL penalties with
this adaptive bonus, GRPO-CARE outperforms standard GRPO on SEED-Bench-R1,
achieving a 6.7% performance gain on the hardest evaluation level and a 24.5%
improvement in consistency. It also shows strong transferability, improving
model performance across diverse video understanding benchmarks. Our work
contributes a systematically designed benchmark and a generalizable
post-training framework, advancing the development of more interpretable and
robust MLLMs.

Conclusion: 提出的多模态双向攻击策略显著提升了对抗样本的跨文本迁移能力。

Abstract: Referring Expression Segmentation (RES) enables precise object segmentation
in images based on natural language descriptions, offering high flexibility and
broad applicability in real-world vision tasks. Despite its impressive
performance, the robustness of RES models against adversarial examples remains
largely unexplored. While prior adversarial attack methods have explored
adversarial robustness on conventional segmentation models, they perform poorly
when directly applied to RES, failing to expose vulnerabilities in its
multimodal structure. Moreover, in practical open-world scenarios, users
typically issue multiple, diverse referring expressions to interact with the
same image, highlighting the need for adversarial examples that generalize
across varied textual inputs. To address these multimodal challenges, we
propose a novel adversarial attack strategy termed \textbf{Multimodal
Bidirectional Attack}, tailored for RES models. Our method introduces learnable
proxy textual embedding perturbation and jointly performs visual-aligned
optimization on the image modality and textual-adversarial optimization on the
textual modality during attack generation. This dual optimization framework
encourages adversarial images to actively adapt to more challenging text
embedding during optimization, thereby enhancing their cross-text
transferability, which refers to the ability of adversarial examples to remain
effective under a variety of unseen or semantically diverse textual inputs.
Extensive experiments conducted on multiple RES models and benchmark datasets
demonstrate the superior effectiveness of our method compared to existing
methods.

Abstract: With the advancement of conversational AI, research on bodily expressions,
including gestures and facial expressions, has also progressed. However, many
existing studies focus on photorealistic avatars, making them unsuitable for
non-photorealistic characters, such as those found in anime. This study
proposes methods for expressing emotions, including exaggerated expressions
unique to non-photorealistic characters, by utilizing expression data extracted
from comics and dialogue-specific semantic gestures. A user study demonstrated
significant improvements across multiple aspects when compared to existing
research.

Result: 在六个公开数据集和新引入的真实驾驶数据集上验证了框架的有效性，代码和新数据集将公开。

Conclusion: GAP框架通过先验知识成功解决了MSSDG和TTPA的融合问题，为多任务远程生理测量提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-source synsemantic domain generalization (MSSDG) for multi-task remote
physiological measurement seeks to enhance the generalizability of these
metrics and attracts increasing attention. However, challenges like partial
labeling and environmental noise may disrupt task-specific accuracy. Meanwhile,
given that real-time adaptation is necessary for personalized products, the
test-time personalized adaptation (TTPA) after MSSDG is also worth exploring,
while the gap between previous generalization and personalization methods is
significant and hard to fuse. Thus, we proposed a unified framework for
MSSD\textbf{G} and TTP\textbf{A} employing \textbf{P}riors (\textbf{GAP}) in
biometrics and remote photoplethysmography (rPPG). We first disentangled
information from face videos into invariant semantics, individual bias, and
noise. Then, multiple modules incorporating priors and our observations were
applied in different stages and for different facial information. Then, based
on the different principles of achieving generalization and personalization,
our framework could simultaneously address MSSDG and TTPA under multi-task
remote physiological estimation with minimal adjustments. We expanded the MSSDG
benchmark to the TTPA protocol on six publicly available datasets and
introduced a new real-world driving dataset with complete labeling. Extensive
experiments that validated our approach, and the codes along with the new
dataset will be released.

Abstract: Accident detection using Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) footage is one of
the most imperative features for enhancing transport safety and efficient
traffic control. To this end, this research addresses the issues of supervised
monitoring and data deficiency in accident detection systems by adapting
excellent deep learning technologies. The motivation arises from rising
statistics in the number of car accidents worldwide; this calls for innovation
and the establishment of a smart, efficient and automated way of identifying
accidents and calling for help to save lives. Addressing the problem of the
scarcity of data, the presented framework joins Generative Adversarial Networks
(GANs) for synthesizing data and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for model
training. Video frames for accidents and non-accidents are collected from
YouTube videos, and we perform resizing, image enhancement and image
normalisation pixel range adjustments. Three models are used: CNN, Fine-tuned
Convolutional Neural Network (FTCNN) and Vision Transformer (VIT) worked best
for detecting accidents from CCTV, obtaining an accuracy rate of 94% and 95%,
while the CNN model obtained 88%. Such results show that the proposed framework
suits traffic safety applications due to its high real-time accident detection
capabilities and broad-scale applicability. This work lays the foundation for
intelligent surveillance systems in the future for real-time traffic
monitoring, smart city framework, and integration of intelligent surveillance
systems into emergency management systems.

Abstract: Being able to generate realistic trajectory options is at the core of
increasing the degree of automation of road vehicles. While model-driven,
rule-based, and classical learning-based methods are widely used to tackle
these tasks at present, they can struggle to effectively capture the complex,
multimodal distributions of future trajectories. In this paper we investigate
whether a generative adversarial network (GAN) trained on videos of bird's-eye
view (BEV) traffic scenarios can generate statistically accurate trajectories
that correctly capture spatial relationships between the agents. To this end,
we propose a pipeline that uses low-resolution BEV occupancy grid videos as
training data for a video generative model. From the generated videos of
traffic scenarios we extract abstract trajectory data using single-frame object
detection and frame-to-frame object matching. We particularly choose a GAN
architecture for the fast training and inference times with respect to
diffusion models. We obtain our best results within 100 GPU hours of training,
with inference times under 20\,ms. We demonstrate the physical realism of the
proposed trajectories in terms of distribution alignment of spatial and dynamic
parameters with respect to the ground truth videos from the Waymo Open Motion
Dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦提示学习方法在性能和鲁棒性之间存在权衡，尤其在分布外数据上表现不佳。

Method: FOCoOp利用三类提示，通过双层分布鲁棒优化和半不平衡最优传输校准全局与OOD提示。

Result: 实验表明FOCoOp能有效捕获分布式异构数据并增强OOD鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FOCoOp填补了联邦提示学习在分布外数据上的性能与鲁棒性缺口。

Abstract: Federated prompt learning (FPL) for vision-language models is a powerful
approach to collaboratively adapt models across distributed clients while
preserving data privacy. However, existing FPL approaches suffer from a
trade-off between performance and robustness, particularly in
out-of-distribution (OOD) shifts, limiting their reliability in real-world
scenarios. The inherent in-distribution (ID) data heterogeneity among different
clients makes it more challenging to maintain this trade-off. To fill this gap,
we introduce a Federated OOD-aware Context Optimization (FOCoOp) framework,
which captures diverse distributions among clients using ID global prompts,
local prompts, and OOD prompts. Specifically, FOCoOp leverages three sets of
prompts to create both class-level and distribution-level separations, which
adapt to OOD shifts through bi-level distributionally robust optimization.
Additionally, FOCoOp improves the discrimination consistency among clients,
i.e., calibrating global prompts, seemingly OOD prompts, and OOD prompts by
semi-unbalanced optimal transport. The extensive experiments on real-world
datasets demonstrate that FOCoOp effectively captures decentralized
heterogeneous distributions and enhances robustness of different OOD shifts.

<details>

Motivation: 现有神经渲染方法（如NeRF和3DGS）依赖高质量输入，限制了其在真实世界退化条件下的鲁棒性。3D LLV旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过形式化退化感知渲染问题，综述了将低层视觉任务（如超分辨率、去模糊）整合到神经渲染框架中的方法。

Result: 总结了代表性方法、数据集和评估协议，展示了3D LLV在真实环境中的潜力。

Conclusion: 3D LLV是提升3D内容生成和场景重建鲁棒性的重要方向，尤其在自动驾驶、AR/VR等领域具有广泛应用。

Abstract: Neural rendering methods such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have achieved significant progress in photorealistic
3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis. However, most existing models
assume clean and high-resolution (HR) multi-view inputs, which limits their
robustness under real-world degradations such as noise, blur, low-resolution
(LR), and weather-induced artifacts. To address these limitations, the emerging
field of 3D Low-Level Vision (3D LLV) extends classical 2D Low-Level Vision
tasks including super-resolution (SR), deblurring, weather degradation removal,
restoration, and enhancement into the 3D spatial domain. This survey, referred
to as R\textsuperscript{3}eVision, provides a comprehensive overview of robust
rendering, restoration, and enhancement for 3D LLV by formalizing the
degradation-aware rendering problem and identifying key challenges related to
spatio-temporal consistency and ill-posed optimization. Recent methods that
integrate LLV into neural rendering frameworks are categorized to illustrate
how they enable high-fidelity 3D reconstruction under adverse conditions.
Application domains such as autonomous driving, AR/VR, and robotics are also
discussed, where reliable 3D perception from degraded inputs is critical. By
reviewing representative methods, datasets, and evaluation protocols, this work
positions 3D LLV as a fundamental direction for robust 3D content generation
and scene-level reconstruction in real-world environments.

Conclusion: 该方法为基于TLS的滑坡监测提供了实用且适应性强的解决方案，并可扩展至其他点云和监测任务。

Abstract: Landslide monitoring is essential for understanding geohazards and mitigating
associated risks. However, existing point cloud-based methods typically rely on
either geometric or radiometric information and often yield sparse or non-3D
displacement estimates. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical
partition-based coarse-to-fine approach that fuses 3D point clouds and
co-registered RGB images to estimate dense 3D displacement vector fields. We
construct patch-level matches using both 3D geometry and 2D image features.
These matches are refined via geometric consistency checks, followed by rigid
transformation estimation per match. Experimental results on two real-world
landslide datasets demonstrate that our method produces 3D displacement
estimates with high spatial coverage (79% and 97%) and high accuracy.
Deviations in displacement magnitude with respect to external measurements
(total station or GNSS observations) are 0.15 m and 0.25 m on the two datasets,
respectively, and only 0.07 m and 0.20 m compared to manually derived
references. These values are below the average scan resolutions (0.08 m and
0.30 m). Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art method F2S3 in spatial
coverage while maintaining comparable accuracy. Our approach offers a practical
and adaptable solution for TLS-based landslide monitoring and is extensible to
other types of point clouds and monitoring tasks. Our example data and source
code are publicly available at https://github.com/zhaoyiww/fusion4landslide.

Motivation: 现有细粒度图像检索方法容易过拟合训练数据，忽视预训练知识，泛化能力不足。

Method: 设计了Object-Perceptual Adaptation和In-Context Adaptation，分别调整输入样本和特征，同时提出Discrimination Perception Transfer平衡检索效率与性能。

Result: DVA在三个分布内和三个分布外细粒度数据集上表现优异，且参数较少。

Conclusion: DVA通过协同适应和知识蒸馏，提升了细粒度图像检索的泛化能力和性能。

Abstract: Fine-Grained Image Retrieval~(FGIR) faces challenges in learning
discriminative visual representations to retrieve images with similar
fine-grained features. Current leading FGIR solutions typically follow two
regimes: enforce pairwise similarity constraints in the semantic embedding
space, or incorporate a localization sub-network to fine-tune the entire model.
However, such two regimes tend to overfit the training data while forgetting
the knowledge gained from large-scale pre-training, thus reducing their
generalization ability. In this paper, we propose a Dual-Vision Adaptation
(DVA) approach for FGIR, which guides the frozen pre-trained model to perform
FGIR through collaborative sample and feature adaptation. Specifically, we
design Object-Perceptual Adaptation, which modifies input samples to help the
pre-trained model perceive critical objects and elements within objects that
are helpful for category prediction. Meanwhile, we propose In-Context
Adaptation, which introduces a small set of parameters for feature adaptation
without modifying the pre-trained parameters. This makes the FGIR task using
these adjusted features closer to the task solved during the pre-training.
Additionally, to balance retrieval efficiency and performance, we propose
Discrimination Perception Transfer to transfer the discriminative knowledge in
the object-perceptual adaptation to the image encoder using the knowledge
distillation mechanism. Extensive experiments show that DVA has fewer learnable
parameters and performs well on three in-distribution and three
out-of-distribution fine-grained datasets.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类视觉在无监督分割和抗噪方面表现优异，而现有AI算法在此类条件下表现不佳。

Method: 基于自组织动力学方程和随机网络概念的学习范式，无需鲁棒训练或监督。

Result: 在数字噪声、天气和模糊等干扰下，性能下降极小（0.01%至7.5%），远超现有方法（23.8%至37.7%）。

Conclusion: SyncMapV2为未来鲁棒且自适应的智能算法提供了新方向。

Abstract: Human vision excels at segmenting visual cues without the need for explicit
training, and it remains remarkably robust even as noise severity increases. In
contrast, existing AI algorithms struggle to maintain accuracy under similar
conditions. Here, we present SyncMapV2, the first to solve unsupervised
segmentation with state-of-the-art robustness. SyncMapV2 exhibits a minimal
drop in mIoU, only 0.01%, under digital corruption, compared to a 23.8% drop
observed in SOTA methods.This superior performance extends across various types
of corruption: noise (7.3% vs. 37.7%), weather (7.5% vs. 33.8%), and blur (7.0%
vs. 29.5%). Notably, SyncMapV2 accomplishes this without any robust training,
supervision, or loss functions. It is based on a learning paradigm that uses
self-organizing dynamical equations combined with concepts from random
networks. Moreover,unlike conventional methods that require re-initialization
for each new input, SyncMapV2 adapts online, mimicking the continuous
adaptability of human vision. Thus, we go beyond the accurate and robust
results, and present the first algorithm that can do all the above online,
adapting to input rather than re-initializing. In adaptability tests, SyncMapV2
demonstrates near-zero performance degradation, which motivates and fosters a
new generation of robust and adaptive intelligence in the near future.

Result: 在合成和真实噪声图像数据集上验证了MADNet优于当前最先进去噪方法。

Conclusion: MADNet通过多尺度自适应和频域处理显著提升了图像去噪效果。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multi-scale architectures have demonstrated
exceptional performance in image denoising tasks. However, existing
architectures mainly depends on a fixed single-input single-output Unet
architecture, ignoring the multi-scale representations of pixel level. In
addition, previous methods treat the frequency domain uniformly, ignoring the
different characteristics of high-frequency and low-frequency noise. In this
paper, we propose a novel multi-scale adaptive dual-domain network (MADNet) for
image denoising. We use image pyramid inputs to restore noise-free results from
low-resolution images. In order to realize the interaction of high-frequency
and low-frequency information, we design an adaptive spatial-frequency learning
unit (ASFU), where a learnable mask is used to separate the information into
high-frequency and low-frequency components. In the skip connections, we design
a global feature fusion block to enhance the features at different scales.
Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real noisy image datasets verify
the effectiveness of MADNet compared with current state-of-the-art denoising
approaches.

Conclusion: DETA++通过多种技术手段显著提升了小样本学习在噪声环境下的鲁棒性和可靠性。

Abstract: Recent advances in model pre-training give rise to task adaptation-based
few-shot learning (FSL), where the goal is to adapt a pre-trained task-agnostic
model for capturing task-specific knowledge with a few-labeled support samples
of the target task.Nevertheless, existing approaches may still fail in the open
world due to the inevitable in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD)
noise from both support and query samples of the target task. With limited
support samples available, i) the adverse effect of the dual noises can be
severely amplified during task adaptation, and ii) the adapted model can
produce unreliable predictions on query samples in the presence of the dual
noises. In this work, we propose DEnoised Task Adaptation (DETA++) for reliable
FSL. DETA++ uses a Contrastive Relevance Aggregation (CoRA) module to calculate
image and region weights for support samples, based on which a clean prototype
loss and a noise entropy maximization loss are proposed to achieve noise-robust
task adaptation. Additionally,DETA++ employs a memory bank to store and refine
clean regions for each inner-task class, based on which a Local Nearest
Centroid Classifier (LocalNCC) is devised to yield noise-robust predictions on
query samples. Moreover, DETA++ utilizes an Intra-class Region Swapping
(IntraSwap) strategy to rectify ID class prototypes during task adaptation,
enhancing the model's robustness to the dual noises. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of DETA++.

Conclusion: 像素级显著性图在笔迹识别中更具实用价值。

Abstract: Neural Networks are the state of the art for many tasks in the computer
vision domain, including Writer Identification (WI) and Writer Verification
(WV). The transparency of these "black box" systems is important for
improvements of performance and reliability. For this work, two transparency
techniques are applied to neural networks trained on WI and WV for the first
time in this domain. The first technique provides pixel-level saliency maps,
while the point-specific saliency maps of the second technique provide
information on similarities between two images. The transparency techniques are
evaluated using deletion and insertion score metrics. The goal is to support
forensic experts with information on similarities in handwritten text and to
explore the characteristics selected by a neural network for the identification
process. For the qualitative evaluation, the highlights of the maps are
compared to the areas forensic experts consider during the identification
process. The evaluation results show that the pixel-wise saliency maps
outperform the point-specific saliency maps and are suitable for the support of
forensic experts.

Abstract: Deep image hashing aims to enable effective large-scale image retrieval by
mapping the input images into simple binary hash codes through deep neural
networks. More recently, Vision Mamba with linear time complexity has attracted
extensive attention from researchers by achieving outstanding performance on
various computer tasks. Nevertheless, the suitability of Mamba for large-scale
image retrieval tasks still needs to be explored. Towards this end, we propose
a visual state space hashing model, called MambaHash. Concretely, we propose a
backbone network with stage-wise architecture, in which grouped Mamba operation
is introduced to model local and global information by utilizing Mamba to
perform multi-directional scanning along different groups of the channel.
Subsequently, the proposed channel interaction attention module is used to
enhance information communication across channels. Finally, we meticulously
design an adaptive feature enhancement module to increase feature diversity and
enhance the visual representation capability of the model. We have conducted
comprehensive experiments on three widely used datasets: CIFAR-10, NUS-WIDE and
IMAGENET. The experimental results demonstrate that compared with the
state-of-the-art deep hashing methods, our proposed MambaHash has well
efficiency and superior performance to effectively accomplish large-scale image
retrieval tasks. Source code is available

pipeline. The prompt-based spatial prior helps to rank the tokens according to
their relevance. Tokens with low-relevance scores are down-weighted, ensuring
that only the relevant ones are propagated for processing across subsequent
stages. This data-driven pruning strategy facilitates end-to-end training,
maintains gradient flow, and improves segmentation accuracy by focusing
computational resources on essential regions. The proposed framework is
integrated with several state-of-the-art models to facilitate the elimination
of irrelevant tokens; thereby, enhancing computational efficiency while
preserving segmentation accuracy. The experimental results show a reduction of
$\sim$ 35-55\% tokens; thus reducing the computational costs relative to the
baselines. Cost-effective medical image processing, using our framework,
facilitates real-time diagnosis by expanding its applicability in
resource-constrained environments.

TL;DR: AGC-Drive是首个大规模真实世界数据集，用于空中-地面协同3D感知，填补了无人机视角数据集的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注车与车、车与基础设施的协作，而无人机提供的动态俯视视角能有效缓解遮挡问题，但缺乏高质量数据集。

Method: 数据集通过两辆配备多摄像头和LiDAR的车辆及一架无人机采集，覆盖14种驾驶场景，包含大量动态交互事件。

Result: 数据集包含120K LiDAR帧和440K图像，涵盖13类对象的3D标注，并提供了基准测试和开源工具包。

Conclusion: AGC-Drive为空中-地面协同感知研究提供了重要资源，推动了多视角多智能体感知的发展。

Abstract: By sharing information across multiple agents, collaborative perception helps
autonomous vehicles mitigate occlusions and improve overall perception
accuracy. While most previous work focus on vehicle-to-vehicle and
vehicle-to-infrastructure collaboration, with limited attention to aerial
perspectives provided by UAVs, which uniquely offer dynamic, top-down views to
alleviate occlusions and monitor large-scale interactive environments. A major
reason for this is the lack of high-quality datasets for aerial-ground
collaborative scenarios. To bridge this gap, we present AGC-Drive, the first
large-scale real-world dataset for Aerial-Ground Cooperative 3D perception. The
data collection platform consists of two vehicles, each equipped with five
cameras and one LiDAR sensor, and one UAV carrying a forward-facing camera and
a LiDAR sensor, enabling comprehensive multi-view and multi-agent perception.
Consisting of approximately 120K LiDAR frames and 440K images, the dataset
covers 14 diverse real-world driving scenarios, including urban roundabouts,
highway tunnels, and on/off ramps. Notably, 19.5% of the data comprises dynamic
interaction events, including vehicle cut-ins, cut-outs, and frequent lane
changes. AGC-Drive contains 400 scenes, each with approximately 100 frames and
fully annotated 3D bounding boxes covering 13 object categories. We provide
benchmarks for two 3D perception tasks: vehicle-to-vehicle collaborative
perception and vehicle-to-UAV collaborative perception. Additionally, we
release an open-source toolkit, including spatiotemporal alignment verification
tools, multi-agent visualization systems, and collaborative annotation
utilities. The dataset and code are available at

Method: 提出CLIP-MG模型，通过姿态引导的语义查询生成和门控多模态融合机制，将人体姿态信息整合到CLIP识别流程中。

Result: 在iMiGUE数据集上，模型Top-1准确率达到61.82%。

Conclusion: 结果表明该方法具有潜力，但完全适配CLIP等视觉语言模型于微手势识别仍具挑战。

Abstract: Micro-gesture recognition is a challenging task in affective computing due to
the subtle, involuntary nature of the gestures and their low movement
amplitude. In this paper, we introduce a Pose-Guided Semantics-Aware CLIP-based
architecture, or CLIP for Micro-Gesture recognition (CLIP-MG), a modified CLIP
model tailored for micro-gesture classification on the iMiGUE dataset. CLIP-MG
integrates human pose (skeleton) information into the CLIP-based recognition
pipeline through pose-guided semantic query generation and a gated multi-modal
fusion mechanism. The proposed model achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 61.82%. These
results demonstrate both the potential of our approach and the remaining
difficulty in fully adapting vision-language models like CLIP for micro-gesture
recognition.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyperPath利用双曲空间建模WSI的语义层次结构，结合视觉和文本特征，通过几何感知方法提升分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖欧几里得嵌入，难以充分捕捉WSI的语义层次结构，限制了分类性能。

Method: 提出HyperPath，结合病理视觉-语言基础模型提取的特征，设计角度模态对齐损失和语义层次一致性损失，利用测地距离进行分类。

Result: 实验表明，HyperPath在多个任务上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 双曲嵌入在WSI分析中具有潜力，能有效提升语义层次建模和分类性能。

Abstract: Pathology is essential for cancer diagnosis, with multiple instance learning
(MIL) widely used for whole slide image (WSI) analysis. WSIs exhibit a natural
hierarchy -- patches, regions, and slides -- with distinct semantic
associations. While some methods attempt to leverage this hierarchy for
improved representation, they predominantly rely on Euclidean embeddings, which
struggle to fully capture semantic hierarchies. To address this limitation, we
propose HyperPath, a novel method that integrates knowledge from textual
descriptions to guide the modeling of semantic hierarchies of WSIs in
hyperbolic space, thereby enhancing WSI classification. Our approach adapts
both visual and textual features extracted by pathology vision-language
foundation models to the hyperbolic space. We design an Angular Modality
Alignment Loss to ensure robust cross-modal alignment, while a Semantic
Hierarchy Consistency Loss further refines feature hierarchies through
entailment and contradiction relationships and thus enhance semantic coherence.
The classification is performed with geodesic distance, which measures the
similarity between entities in the hyperbolic semantic hierarchy. This
eliminates the need for linear classifiers and enables a geometry-aware
approach to WSI analysis. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves
superior performance across tasks compared to existing methods, highlighting
the potential of hyperbolic embeddings for WSI analysis.

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个统一框架，用于生成和评估基于OCR的视觉文档理解（VDU）模型的多模态对抗攻击，涵盖六种基于梯度的布局攻击场景。实验表明，行级攻击和复合扰动（BBox + Pixel + Text）对性能影响最大。


<details>

Motivation: 尽管VDU系统在信息提取中表现优异，但其在现实对抗扰动下的鲁棒性尚未充分研究。

Method: 提出统一框架，生成和评估多模态对抗攻击，包括OCR边界框、像素和文本的操纵，约束布局扰动预算以保持合理性。

Result: 在四个数据集和六种模型家族中，行级攻击和复合扰动导致最严重的性能下降，PGD-based BBox扰动优于随机移位基线。

Conclusion: 布局预算、文本修改和对抗可转移性对攻击效果有显著影响，研究为VDU模型的鲁棒性评估提供了新视角。

Abstract: Visual Document Understanding (VDU) systems have achieved strong performance
in information extraction by integrating textual, layout, and visual signals.
However, their robustness under realistic adversarial perturbations remains
insufficiently explored. We introduce the first unified framework for
generating and evaluating multi-modal adversarial attacks on OCR-based VDU
models. Our method covers six gradient-based layout attack scenarios,
incorporating manipulations of OCR bounding boxes, pixels, and texts across
both word and line granularities, with constraints on layout perturbation
budget (e.g., IoU >= 0.6) to preserve plausibility.
  Experimental results across four datasets (FUNSD, CORD, SROIE, DocVQA) and
six model families demonstrate that line-level attacks and compound
perturbations (BBox + Pixel + Text) yield the most severe performance
degradation. Projected Gradient Descent (PGD)-based BBox perturbations
outperform random-shift baselines in all investigated models. Ablation studies
further validate the impact of layout budget, text modification, and
adversarial transferability.

Method: 在ResNet50中集成FFT、WHT和DCT，使用CIFAR-100数据集进行实验。

Result: WHT显著降低能耗（从25,606 kJ降至39 kJ）并提高准确率（从66%提升至79%）。

Conclusion: WHT是一种高效且节能的CNN优化方法，适用于能源受限场景。

Abstract: This study investigates the integration of signal processing transformations
-- Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), Walsh-Hadamard Transform (WHT), and Discrete
Cosine Transform (DCT) -- within the ResNet50 convolutional neural network
(CNN) model for image classification. The primary objective is to assess the
trade-offs between computational efficiency, energy consumption, and
classification accuracy during training and inference. Using the CIFAR-100
dataset (100 classes, 60,000 images), experiments demonstrated that
incorporating WHT significantly reduced energy consumption while improving
accuracy. Specifically, a baseline ResNet50 model achieved a testing accuracy
of 66%, consuming an average of 25,606 kJ per model. In contrast, a modified
ResNet50 incorporating WHT in the early convolutional layers achieved 74%
accuracy, and an enhanced version with WHT applied to both early and late
layers achieved 79% accuracy, with an average energy consumption of only 39 kJ
per model. These results demonstrate the potential of WHT as a highly efficient
and effective approach for energy-constrained CNN applications.

Result: CNN模型在同源数据上表现优异，但在跨数据集时难以捕捉遮挡线索。

Conclusion: 需要专门的检测策略来处理遮挡相关的视觉伪影。

Abstract: Face swapping manipulations in video streams represents an increasing threat
in remote video communications, due to advances
  in automated and real-time tools. Recent literature proposes to characterize
and exploit visual artifacts introduced in video frames
  by swapping algorithms when dealing with challenging physical scenes, such as
face occlusions. This paper investigates the
  effectiveness of this approach by benchmarking CNN-based data-driven models
on two data corpora (including a newly collected
  one) and analyzing generalization capabilities with respect to different
acquisition sources and swapping algorithms. The results
  confirm excellent performance of general-purpose CNN architectures when
operating within the same data source, but a significant
  difficulty in robustly characterizing occlusion-based visual cues across
datasets. This highlights the need for specialized detection
  strategies to deal with such artifacts.

Motivation: 当前数据集在降雪和晴朗天气条件下的标注数据不足，或依赖合成数据，导致评估不准确。

Method: 通过扩展CADC数据集，创建CADC+，配对降雪和晴朗天气数据，最小化领域偏移。

Result: 初步结果显示，降雪同时引入噪声和新的数据领域，增加了不确定性。

Conclusion: CADC+为研究降雪对自动驾驶的影响提供了更准确的数据支持。

Abstract: The impact of snowfall on 3D object detection performance remains
underexplored. Conducting such an evaluation requires a dataset with sufficient
labelled data from both weather conditions, ideally captured in the same
driving environment. Current driving datasets with LiDAR point clouds either do
not provide enough labelled data in both snowy and clear weather conditions, or
rely on de-snowing methods to generate synthetic clear weather. Synthetic data
often lacks realism and introduces an additional domain shift that confounds
accurate evaluations. To address these challenges, we present CADC+, the first
paired weather domain adaptation dataset for autonomous driving in winter
conditions. CADC+ extends the Canadian Adverse Driving Conditions dataset
(CADC) using clear weather data that was recorded on the same roads and in the
same period as CADC. To create CADC+, we pair each CADC sequence with a clear
weather sequence that matches the snowy sequence as closely as possible. CADC+
thus minimizes the domain shift resulting from factors unrelated to the
presence of snow. We also present some preliminary results using CADC+ to
evaluate the effect of snow on 3D object detection performance. We observe that
snow introduces a combination of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, acting
as both noise and a distinct data domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实例分割在农业等领域需要大量像素级标注数据，开发高效模型困难，尤其是密集遮挡场景。

Method: 设计GLMask图像-掩码表示，减少对颜色特征的依赖；通过语义分割生成实例分割。

Result: 在小麦头实例分割上达到98.5% mAP@50，在COCO数据集上提升12.6%。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅适用于农业，还可推广到其他类似数据特征的领域。

Abstract: Instance segmentation is essential for applications such as automated
monitoring of plant health, growth, and yield. However, extensive effort is
required to create large-scale datasets with pixel-level annotations of each
object instance for developing instance segmentation models that restrict the
use of deep learning in these areas. This challenge is more significant in
images with densely packed, self-occluded objects, which are common in
agriculture. To address this challenge, we propose a semi-self-supervised
learning approach that requires minimal manual annotation to develop a
high-performing instance segmentation model. We design GLMask, an image-mask
representation for the model to focus on shape, texture, and pattern while
minimizing its dependence on color features. We develop a pipeline to generate
semantic segmentation and then transform it into instance-level segmentation.
The proposed approach substantially outperforms the conventional instance
segmentation models, establishing a state-of-the-art wheat head instance
segmentation model with mAP@50 of 98.5%. Additionally, we assessed the proposed
methodology on the general-purpose Microsoft COCO dataset, achieving a
significant performance improvement of over 12.6% mAP@50. This highlights that
the utility of our proposed approach extends beyond precision agriculture and
applies to other domains, specifically those with similar data characteristics.

Motivation: 解决AI模型在卒中分诊中依赖真实患者数据带来的伦理和隐私挑战。

Method: 利用预训练视频运动转移模型将真实患者面部运动映射到合成身份上，并通过条件生成模型调整输入空间以确保准确运动转移。

Result: 合成视频有效保留了卒中相关面部模式，同时提供强大的隐私保护，保持诊断准确性。

Conclusion: SafeTriage为神经疾病数据共享和AI驱动的临床分析提供了安全且伦理的基础。

Abstract: Effective stroke triage in emergency settings often relies on clinicians'
ability to identify subtle abnormalities in facial muscle coordination. While
recent AI models have shown promise in detecting such patterns from patient
facial videos, their reliance on real patient data raises significant ethical
and privacy challenges -- especially when training robust and generalizable
models across institutions. To address these concerns, we propose SafeTriage, a
novel method designed to de-identify patient facial videos while preserving
essential motion cues crucial for stroke diagnosis. SafeTriage leverages a
pretrained video motion transfer (VMT) model to map the motion characteristics
of real patient faces onto synthetic identities. This approach retains
diagnostically relevant facial dynamics without revealing the patients'
identities. To mitigate the distribution shift between normal population
pre-training videos and patient population test videos, we introduce a
conditional generative model for visual prompt tuning, which adapts the input
space of the VMT model to ensure accurate motion transfer without needing to
fine-tune the VMT model backbone. Comprehensive evaluation, including
quantitative metrics and clinical expert assessments, demonstrates that
SafeTriage-produced synthetic videos effectively preserve stroke-relevant
facial patterns, enabling reliable AI-based triage. Our evaluations also show
that SafeTriage provides robust privacy protection while maintaining diagnostic
accuracy, offering a secure and ethically sound foundation for data sharing and
AI-driven clinical analysis in neurological disorders.

Conclusion: 空间感知指标在医学图像分割中能更有效地评估不确定性。

Abstract: Uncertainty maps highlight unreliable regions in segmentation predictions.
However, most uncertainty evaluation metrics treat voxels independently,
ignoring spatial context and anatomical structure. As a result, they may assign
identical scores to qualitatively distinct patterns (e.g., scattered vs.
boundary-aligned uncertainty). We propose three spatially aware metrics that
incorporate structural and boundary information and conduct a thorough
validation on medical imaging data from the prostate zonal segmentation
challenge within the Medical Segmentation Decathlon. Our results demonstrate
improved alignment with clinically important factors and better discrimination
between meaningful and spurious uncertainty patterns.

Conclusion: MetaQAP为无参考IQA提供了鲁棒且可推广的框架，推动了该领域的进展。

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) is a critical task in a wide range of
applications but remains challenging due to the subjective nature of human
perception and the complexity of real-world image distortions. This study
proposes MetaQAP, a novel no-reference IQA model designed to address these
challenges by leveraging quality-aware pre-training and meta-learning. The
model performs three key contributions: pre-training Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) on a quality-aware dataset, implementing a quality-aware loss
function to optimize predictions, and integrating a meta-learner to form an
ensemble model that effectively combines predictions from multiple base models.
Experimental evaluations were conducted on three benchmark datasets: LiveCD,
KonIQ-10K, and BIQ2021. The proposed MetaQAP model achieved exceptional
performance with Pearson Linear Correlation Coefficient (PLCC) and Spearman
Rank Order Correlation Coefficient (SROCC) scores of 0.9885/0.9812 on LiveCD,
0.9702/0.9658 on KonIQ-10K, and 0.884/0.8765 on BIQ2021, outperforming existing
IQA methods. Cross-dataset evaluations further demonstrated the
generalizability of the model, with PLCC and SROCC scores ranging from 0.6721
to 0.8023 and 0.6515 to 0.7805, respectively, across diverse datasets. The
ablation study confirmed the significance of each model component, revealing
substantial performance degradation when critical elements such as the
meta-learner or quality-aware loss function were omitted. MetaQAP not only
addresses the complexities of authentic distortions but also establishes a
robust and generalizable framework for practical IQA applications. By advancing
the state-of-the-art in no-reference IQA, this research provides valuable
insights and methodologies for future improvements and extensions in the field.

TL;DR: MM-LG提出了一种从CLIP中提取多模态通用知识的新框架，通过加权和方式提取多模态和单模态知识，显著提升了性能并降低了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有Learngene方法在多模态场景中提取通用知识的不足，以及CLIP大规模预训练的计算开销问题。

Method: 设计多模态和单模态块，以加权和方式提取通用知识，并用这些组件初始化不同规模和模态的模型。

Result: 在多个数据集上性能优于现有方法（如Oxford-IIIT PET提升3.1%），同时参数存储和预训练成本大幅降低。

Conclusion: MM-LG是一种高效的多模态通用知识提取框架，适用于下游任务的快速部署。

Abstract: CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) has attracted widespread
attention for its multimodal generalizable knowledge, which is significant for
downstream tasks. However, the computational overhead of a large number of
parameters and large-scale pre-training poses challenges of pre-training a
different scale of CLIP. Learngene extracts the generalizable components termed
as learngene from an ancestry model and initializes diverse descendant models
with it. Previous Learngene paradigms fail to handle the generalizable
knowledge in multimodal scenarios. In this paper, we put forward the idea of
utilizing a multimodal block to extract the multimodal generalizable knowledge,
which inspires us to propose MM-LG (Multimodal Learngene), a novel framework
designed to extract and leverage generalizable components from CLIP.
Specifically, we first establish multimodal and unimodal blocks to extract the
multimodal and unimodal generalizable knowledge in a weighted-sum manner.
Subsequently, we employ these components to numerically initialize descendant
models of varying scales and modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate
MM-LG's effectiveness, which achieves performance gains over existing learngene
approaches (e.g.,+3.1% on Oxford-IIIT PET and +4.13% on Flickr30k) and
comparable or superior results to the pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm
(e.g.,+1.9% on Oxford-IIIT PET and +3.65% on Flickr30k). Notably, MM-LG
requires only around 25% of the parameter storage while reducing around 2.8
times pre-training costs for diverse model scales compared to the pre-training
and fine-tuning paradigm, making it particularly suitable for efficient
deployment across diverse downstream tasks.

Motivation: 现有研究未深入探讨合成标题设计对模型性能的影响，本研究填补了这一空白。

Method: 系统研究不同合成标题策略对文本到图像模型性能的影响。

Result: 密集高质量标题提升文本对齐但可能牺牲美学和多样性；随机长度标题平衡美学与对齐；标题分布变化显著影响输出偏差。

Conclusion: 标题设计对模型性能至关重要，研究为文本到图像生成提供了更有效的训练数据策略。

Abstract: Training data is at the core of any successful text-to-image models. The
quality and descriptiveness of image text are crucial to a model's performance.
Given the noisiness and inconsistency in web-scraped datasets, recent works
shifted towards synthetic training captions. While this setup is generally
believed to produce more capable models, current literature does not provide
any insights into its design choices. This study closes this gap by
systematically investigating how different synthetic captioning strategies
impact the downstream performance of text-to-image models. Our experiments
demonstrate that dense, high-quality captions enhance text alignment but may
introduce trade-offs in output aesthetics and diversity. Conversely, captions
of randomized lengths yield balanced improvements across aesthetics and
alignment without compromising sample diversity. We also demonstrate that
varying caption distributions introduce significant shifts in the output bias
of a trained model. Our findings underscore the importance of caption design in
achieving optimal model performance and provide practical insights for more
effective training data strategies in text-to-image generation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过条纹结构增强对抗性贴片攻击效果的方法，显著提升了在物理世界中攻击立体深度估计系统的实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 立体深度估计在自动驾驶和机器人技术中至关重要，但对抗性攻击可以揭示其潜在漏洞。现有方法在物理世界中效果不佳，限制了实用性。

Method: 通过引入条纹结构（即在重复纹理之间加入规则间隔），并联合优化条纹结构和纹理元素，开发了一种新型对抗性贴片攻击方法。

Result: 生成的对抗性贴片能有效攻击先进的立体深度估计方法（如RAFT-Stereo和STTR），并在实际条件下成功攻击商用RGB-D相机（如Intel RealSense）。

Conclusion: 条纹结构的引入显著提升了对抗性贴片的攻击效果，为立体系统的安全评估提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Stereo Depth estimation is a critical task in autonomous driving and
robotics, where inaccuracies (such as misidentifying nearby objects as distant)
can lead to dangerous situations. Adversarial attacks against stereo depth
estimation can help reveal vulnerabilities before deployment. Previous work has
shown that repeating optimized textures can effectively mislead stereo depth
estimation in digital settings. However, our research reveals that these
naively repeated texture structures perform poorly in physical-world
implementations, i.e., when deployed as patches, limiting their practical
utility for testing stereo depth estimation systems. In this work, for the
first time, we discover that introducing regular intervals between repeated
textures, creating a striped structure, significantly enhances the patch attack
effectiveness. Through extensive experimentation, we analyze how variations of
this novel structure influence the performance. Based on these insights, we
develop a novel stereo depth attack that jointly optimizes both the striped
structure and texture elements. Our generated adversarial patches can be
inserted into any scenes and successfully attack state-of-the-art stereo depth
estimation methods, i.e., RAFT-Stereo and STTR. Most critically, our patch can
also attack commercial RGB-D cameras (Intel RealSense) in real-world
conditions, demonstrating their practical relevance for security assessment of
stereo systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LaVi提出了一种新型的大视觉语言模型，通过内部特征调制实现高效视觉语言融合，显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在视觉语言融合上效率低下，存在结构破坏或计算负担问题，限制了可扩展性和效率。

Method: LaVi通过轻量级自适应变换，将视觉条件化的增量注入层归一化的仿射参数中，直接调制语言隐藏状态，避免长上下文扩展。

Result: 在15个图像和视频基准测试中，LaVi不仅达到最先进的多模态性能，还显著提升效率，相比LLaVA-OV-7B，FLOPs减少94.0%，推理速度提升3.1倍，内存使用减半。

Conclusion: LaVi是一种可扩展且实用的实时多模态推理解决方案，代码和模型即将发布。

Abstract: Despite the impressive advancements of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs),
existing approaches suffer from a fundamental bottleneck: inefficient
visual-language integration. Current methods either disrupt the model's
inherent structure or introduce severe long-context computational burden,
severely limiting scalability and efficiency. In this paper, we rethink
multimodal integration and present LaVi, a novel LVLM that enables seamless and
efficient vision-language fusion through internal feature modulation within the
Large Language Models (LLMs). Unlike dominant LVLMs that rely on visual token
concatenation, LaVi bypasses long-context expansion by introducing a
lightweight and adaptive transformation, which incorporates visual context by
injecting token-wise vision-conditioned deltas into the affine parameters of
layer normalization. This mechanism directly modulates linguistic hidden states
based on visual input, ensuring precise vision-language alignment while
preserving the LLM's linguistic priors and drastically reducing computational
costs. Extensive evaluations across 15 image and video benchmarks demonstrate
that LaVi not only achieves state-of-the-art multimodal performance but also
dramatically enhances efficiency. Compared to LLaVA-OV-7B, LaVi reduces FLOPs
by 94.0%, improves inference speed by 3.1 times, and cuts memory usage in half
- establishing LaVi as a scalable and practical solution for real-time
multimodal reasoning. The code and models will be released soon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未充分利用语言模型中丰富的常识先验（如场景上下文），而这些先验对理解视频动作至关重要。

Method: 1) 视频上下文总结组件生成候选对象、活动及其交互；2) 描述生成模块通过常识推理推断场景和后续活动；3) 多模态活动识别头结合视觉和文本线索。

Result: 在Action Genome和Charades数据集上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 结合语言驱动的常识先验能显著提升视频动作识别性能。

Abstract: Recent video action recognition methods have shown excellent performance by
adapting large-scale pre-trained language-image models to the video domain.
However, language models contain rich common sense priors - the scene contexts
that humans use to constitute an understanding of objects, human-object
interactions, and activities - that have not been fully exploited. In this
paper, we introduce a framework incorporating language-driven common sense
priors to identify cluttered video action sequences from monocular views that
are often heavily occluded. We propose: (1) A video context summary component
that generates candidate objects, activities, and the interactions between
objects and activities; (2) A description generation module that describes the
current scene given the context and infers subsequent activities, through
auxiliary prompts and common sense reasoning; (3) A multi-modal activity
recognition head that combines visual and textual cues to recognize video
actions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the challenging
Action Genome and Charades datasets.

Result: 在六个公共GCD基准测试中，该方法在FSGCD设置下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过决策边界增强和亲和力检索，显著提升了在已知信息稀缺条件下的GCD性能。

Abstract: While existing Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) models have achieved
significant success, their performance with limited labeled samples and a small
number of known categories remains largely unexplored. In this work, we
introduce the task of Few-shot Generalized Category Discovery (FSGCD), aiming
to achieve competitive performance in GCD tasks under conditions of known
information scarcity. To tackle this challenge, we propose a decision boundary
enhancement framework with affinity-based retrieval. Our framework is designed
to learn the decision boundaries of known categories and transfer these
boundaries to unknown categories. First, we use a decision boundary
pre-training module to mitigate the overfitting of pre-trained information on
known category boundaries and improve the learning of these decision boundaries
using labeled samples. Second, we implement a two-stage retrieval-guided
decision boundary optimization strategy. Specifically, this strategy further
enhances the severely limited known boundaries by using affinity-retrieved
pseudo-labeled samples. Then, these refined boundaries are applied to unknown
clusters via guidance from affinity-based feature retrieval. Experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing methods on
six public GCD benchmarks under the FSGCD setting. The codes are available at:

Motivation: 现有文本引导的红外与可见光图像融合方法对文本语义信息的利用不足，需更有效的整合方式。

Result: 实验表明TeSG在下游任务（如检测和分割）中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TeSG通过多级文本语义引导，显著提升了红外与可见光图像融合的效果和实用性。

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion (IVF) aims to combine complementary
information from both image modalities, producing more informative and
comprehensive outputs. Recently, text-guided IVF has shown great potential due
to its flexibility and versatility. However, the effective integration and
utilization of textual semantic information remains insufficiently studied. To
tackle these challenges, we introduce textual semantics at two levels: the mask
semantic level and the text semantic level, both derived from textual
descriptions extracted by large Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Building on
this, we propose Textual Semantic Guidance for infrared and visible image
fusion, termed TeSG, which guides the image synthesis process in a way that is
optimized for downstream tasks such as detection and segmentation.
Specifically, TeSG consists of three core components: a Semantic Information
Generator (SIG), a Mask-Guided Cross-Attention (MGCA) module, and a Text-Driven
Attentional Fusion (TDAF) module. The SIG generates mask and text semantics
based on textual descriptions. The MGCA module performs initial attention-based
fusion of visual features from both infrared and visible images, guided by mask
semantics. Finally, the TDAF module refines the fusion process with gated
attention driven by text semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
competitiveness of our approach, particularly in terms of performance on
downstream tasks, compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 现有方法通常仅限制变换在光谱模式上，忽略了其他张量模式的低秩特性，因此需要一种更全面的方法。

Method: 提出3DeepRep模型，通过三方向TNN正则化强制低秩性，并通过可学习聚合模块融合结果。

Result: 在真实HSI数据集上，该方法在定性和定量上均优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 3DeepRep模型通过多方向深度变换和低秩正则化，显著提升了超光谱图像修复效果。

Abstract: Recent approaches based on transform-based tensor nuclear norm (TNN) have
demonstrated notable effectiveness in hyperspectral image (HSI) inpainting by
leveraging low-rank structures in latent representations. Recent developments
incorporate deep transforms to improve low-rank tensor representation; however,
existing approaches typically restrict the transform to the spectral mode,
neglecting low-rank properties along other tensor modes. In this paper, we
propose a novel 3-directional deep low-rank tensor representation (3DeepRep)
model, which performs deep nonlinear transforms along all three modes of the
HSI tensor. To enforce low-rankness, the model minimizes the nuclear norms of
mode-i frontal slices in the corresponding latent space for each direction
(i=1,2,3), forming a 3-directional TNN regularization. The outputs from the
three directional branches are subsequently fused via a learnable aggregation
module to produce the final result. An efficient gradient-based optimization
algorithm is developed to solve the model in a self-supervised manner.
Extensive experiments on real-world HSI datasets demonstrate that the proposed
method achieves superior inpainting performance compared to existing
state-of-the-art techniques, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机多模态目标检测中，RGB和红外图像的异步成像导致空间错位，引发语义不一致和模态冲突，现有方法未能有效解决。

Method: CoDAF框架包含两个模块：OSA模块通过偏移估计和可变形卷积对齐特征，DAFM模块通过动态注意力平衡模态贡献并优化融合特征。

Result: 在DroneVehicle数据集上，CoDAF实现了78.6%的mAP。

Conclusion: CoDAF通过统一设计解决了多模态检测中的对齐和融合问题，提升了无人机目标检测的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) object detection plays a vital role in
applications such as environmental monitoring and urban security. To improve
robustness, recent studies have explored multimodal detection by fusing visible
(RGB) and infrared (IR) imagery. However, due to UAV platform motion and
asynchronous imaging, spatial misalignment frequently occurs between
modalities, leading to weak alignment. This introduces two major challenges:
semantic inconsistency at corresponding spatial locations and modality conflict
during feature fusion. Existing methods often address these issues in
isolation, limiting their effectiveness. In this paper, we propose Cross-modal
Offset-guided Dynamic Alignment and Fusion (CoDAF), a unified framework that
jointly tackles both challenges in weakly aligned UAV-based object detection.
CoDAF comprises two novel modules: the Offset-guided Semantic Alignment (OSA),
which estimates attention-based spatial offsets and uses deformable convolution
guided by a shared semantic space to align features more precisely; and the
Dynamic Attention-guided Fusion Module (DAFM), which adaptively balances
modality contributions through gating and refines fused features via
spatial-channel dual attention. By integrating alignment and fusion in a
unified design, CoDAF enables robust UAV object detection. Experiments on
standard benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach, with CoDAF
achieving a mAP of 78.6% on the DroneVehicle dataset.

Abstract: In medical imaging, AI decision-support systems must balance accuracy and
interpretability to build user trust and support effective clinical
decision-making. Recently, Variational Information Pursuit (V-IP) and its
variants have emerged as interpretable-by-design modeling techniques, aiming to
explain AI decisions in terms of human-understandable, clinically relevant
concepts. However, existing V-IP methods overlook instance-level uncertainties
in query-answer generation, which can arise from model limitations (epistemic
uncertainty) or variability in expert responses (aleatoric uncertainty).
  This paper introduces Uncertainty-Aware V-IP (UAV-IP), a novel framework that
integrates uncertainty quantification into the V-IP process. We evaluate UAV-IP
across four medical imaging datasets, PH2, Derm7pt, BrEaST, and SkinCon,
demonstrating an average AUC improvement of approximately 3.2% while generating
20% more concise explanations compared to baseline V-IP, without sacrificing
informativeness. These findings highlight the importance of uncertainty-aware
reasoning in interpretable by design models for robust and reliable medical
decision-making.

Abstract: With the rapid development of image generation technologies, especially the
advancement of Diffusion Models, the quality of synthesized images has
significantly improved, raising concerns among researchers about information
security. To mitigate the malicious abuse of diffusion models,
diffusion-generated image detection has proven to be an effective
countermeasure.However, a key challenge for forgery detection is generalising
to diffusion models not seen during training. In this paper, we address this
problem by focusing on image noise. We observe that images from different
diffusion models share similar noise patterns, distinct from genuine images.
Building upon this insight, we introduce a novel Noise-Aware Self-Attention
(NASA) module that focuses on noise regions to capture anomalous patterns. To
implement a SOTA detection model, we incorporate NASA into Swin Transformer,
forming an novel detection architecture NASA-Swin. Additionally, we employ a
cross-modality fusion embedding to combine RGB and noise images, along with a
channel mask strategy to enhance feature learning from both modalities.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in
enhancing detection capabilities for diffusion-generated images. When
encountering unseen generation methods, our approach achieves the
state-of-the-art performance.Our code is available at

Conclusion: 该方法能有效处理对象嵌入和遮挡问题，适用于已知和未知类别对象。

Abstract: Despite the great success of the deep features in content-based image
retrieval, the visual instance search remains challenging due to the lack of
effective instance level feature representation. Supervised or weakly
supervised object detection methods are not among the options due to their poor
performance on the unknown object categories. In this paper, based on the
feature set output from self-supervised ViT, the instance level region
discovery is modeled as detecting the compact feature subsets in a hierarchical
fashion. The hierarchical decomposition results in a hierarchy of feature
subsets. The non-leaf nodes and leaf nodes on the hierarchy correspond to the
various instance regions in an image of different semantic scales. The
hierarchical decomposition well addresses the problem of object embedding and
occlusions, which are widely observed in the real scenarios. The features
derived from the nodes on the hierarchy make up a comprehensive representation
for the latent instances in the image. Our instance-level descriptor remains
effective on both the known and unknown object categories. Empirical studies on
three instance search benchmarks show that it outperforms state-of-the-art
methods considerably.

Abstract: Infrared and visible light image fusion aims to combine the strengths of both
modalities to generate images that are rich in information and fulfill visual
or computational requirements. This paper proposes an image fusion method based
on Implicit Neural Representations (INR), referred to as INRFuse. This method
parameterizes a continuous function through a neural network to implicitly
represent the multimodal information of the image, breaking through the
traditional reliance on discrete pixels or explicit features. The normalized
spatial coordinates of the infrared and visible light images serve as inputs,
and multi-layer perceptrons is utilized to adaptively fuse the features of both
modalities, resulting in the output of the fused image. By designing multiple
loss functions, the method jointly optimizes the similarity between the fused
image and the original images, effectively preserving the thermal radiation
information of the infrared image while maintaining the texture details of the
visible light image. Furthermore, the resolution-independent characteristic of
INR allows for the direct fusion of images with varying resolutions and
achieves super-resolution reconstruction through high-density coordinate
queries. Experimental results indicate that INRFuse outperforms existing
methods in both subjective visual quality and objective evaluation metrics,
producing fused images with clear structures, natural details, and rich
information without the necessity for a training dataset.

Abstract: Diffusion models excel in image generation but are computational and
resource-intensive due to their reliance on iterative Markov chain processes,
leading to error accumulation and limiting the effectiveness of naive
compression techniques. In this paper, we propose PQCAD-DM, a novel hybrid
compression framework combining Progressive Quantization (PQ) and
Calibration-Assisted Distillation (CAD) to address these challenges. PQ employs
a two-stage quantization with adaptive bit-width transitions guided by a
momentum-based mechanism, reducing excessive weight perturbations in
low-precision. CAD leverages full-precision calibration datasets during
distillation, enabling the student to match full-precision performance even
with a quantized teacher. As a result, PQCAD-DM achieves a balance between
computational efficiency and generative quality, halving inference time while
maintaining competitive performance. Extensive experiments validate PQCAD-DM's
superior generative capabilities and efficiency across diverse datasets,

Abstract: Deep learning has demonstrated remarkable success in medical image
segmentation and computer-aided diagnosis. In particular, numerous advanced
methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance in brain tumor segmentation
from MRI scans. While recent studies in other medical imaging domains have
revealed that integrating textual reports with visual data can enhance
segmentation accuracy, the field of brain tumor analysis lacks a comprehensive
dataset that combines radiological images with corresponding textual
annotations. This limitation has hindered the exploration of multimodal
approaches that leverage both imaging and textual data.
  To bridge this critical gap, we introduce the TextBraTS dataset, the first
publicly available volume-level multimodal dataset that contains paired MRI
volumes and rich textual annotations, derived from the widely adopted BraTS2020
benchmark. Building upon this novel dataset, we propose a novel baseline
framework and sequential cross-attention method for text-guided volumetric
medical image segmentation. Through extensive experiments with various
text-image fusion strategies and templated text formulations, our approach
demonstrates significant improvements in brain tumor segmentation accuracy,
offering valuable insights into effective multimodal integration techniques.

TL;DR: 论文提出RealSR-R1，结合视觉与语言推理的VLCoT框架，通过GRPO优化解决真实世界图像超分辨率任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以准确理解退化图像内容，导致重建结果低保真且不自然。

Method: 提出VLCoT框架模拟人类处理退化图像过程，引入GRPO优化，设计四种奖励函数。

Result: 实验表明RealSR-R1能生成真实细节并准确理解图像内容，尤其在语义丰富或严重退化场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: VLCoT-GRPO框架有效提升真实世界图像超分辨率任务的表现。

Abstract: Real-World Image Super-Resolution is one of the most challenging task in
image restoration. However, existing methods struggle with an accurate
understanding of degraded image content, leading to reconstructed results that
are both low-fidelity and unnatural. We present RealSR-R1 in this work, which
empowers the RealSR models with understanding and reasoning capabilities.
Inspired by the success of Chain of Thought (CoT) in large language models
(LLMs), we simulate the human process of handling degraded images and propose
the VLCoT framework, which integrates vision and language reasoning. The
framework aims to precisely restore image details by progressively generating
more comprehensive text and higher-resolution images. To overcome the challenge
of traditional supervised learning CoT failing to generalize to real-world
scenarios, we introduce, for the first time, Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) into the Real-World Image Super-Resolution task. We propose VLCoT-GRPO
as a solution, which designs four reward functions: (1) Format reward, used to
standardize the CoT process; (2) Degradation reward, to incentivize accurate
degradation estimation; (3) Understanding reward, to ensure the accuracy of the
generated content; and (4) Generation reward, where we propose using a visual
expert model to evaluate the quality of generated images, encouraging the model
to generate more realistic images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
proposed RealSR-R1 can generate realistic details and accurately understand
image content, particularly in semantically rich scenes or images with severe
degradation.

Abstract: Synthetic video generation is progressing very rapidly. The latest models can
produce very realistic high-resolution videos that are virtually
indistinguishable from real ones. Although several video forensic detectors
have been recently proposed, they often exhibit poor generalization, which
limits their applicability in a real-world scenario. Our key insight to
overcome this issue is to guide the detector towards seeing what really
matters. In fact, a well-designed forensic classifier should focus on
identifying intrinsic low-level artifacts introduced by a generative
architecture rather than relying on high-level semantic flaws that characterize
a specific model. In this work, first, we study different generative
architectures, searching and identifying discriminative features that are
unbiased, robust to impairments, and shared across models. Then, we introduce a
novel forensic-oriented data augmentation strategy based on the wavelet
decomposition and replace specific frequency-related bands to drive the model
to exploit more relevant forensic cues. Our novel training paradigm improves
the generalizability of AI-generated video detectors, without the need for
complex algorithms and large datasets that include multiple synthetic
generators. To evaluate our approach, we train the detector using data from a
single generative model and test it against videos produced by a wide range of
other models. Despite its simplicity, our method achieves a significant
accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art detectors and obtains excellent
results even on very recent generative models, such as NOVA and FLUX. Code and
data will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了Co-VisiON基准测试，用于评估稀疏图像集中的共视性推理能力，发现现有视觉模型在此任务上表现不佳，尤其是与人类相比。提出的多视角基线模型Covis表现最佳，但仍需进一步提升。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人类共视性推理能力是否被当前视觉模型达到，并探索其在稀疏条件下的表现。

Method: 引入Co-VisiON基准测试，评估1000多个室内场景的稀疏图像集共视性推理，并提出多视角基线模型Covis。

Result: 现有视觉模型在稀疏条件下表现不佳，专有视觉语言模型表现最好，但仍远低于人类水平。Covis在纯视觉模型中表现最佳。

Conclusion: 共视性推理需要高层次的多视角空间理解，未来研究需进一步提升模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Humans exhibit a remarkable ability to recognize co-visibility-the
overlapping regions visible in multiple images-even when these images are
sparsely distributed across a complex scene. This capability is foundational in
3D vision and robotic perception. Despite significant progress in vision
learning, it remains unclear whether current vision models have reached
human-level proficiency in co-visibility analysis. In this work, we introduce
the Co-Visibility reasONing (Co-VisiON) benchmark, designed to directly
evaluate co-visibility reasoning on sparse image sets across over 1000 indoor
scenarios. Our experiments reveal that while co-visibility is typically treated
as a low-level feature matching task, it poses a significant challenge for
existing vision models under sparse conditions. Notably, a proprietary
vision-language model outperforms all purely vision-based approaches, with all
models lagging substantially behind human performance. This gap underscores the
need for more than basic pairwise vision processing-it calls for a
comprehensive spatial understanding through high-level reasoning across
multiple views. Inspired by human visual cognition, we propose a novel
multi-view baseline, Covis, which achieves top performance among pure vision
models and narrows the gap to the proprietary VLM. We hope our benchmark and
findings will spur further advancements in developing vision models capable of
robust, high-level reasoning in challenging, sparse environments. Our dataset

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）在视觉理解和生成建模中存在分离问题，即"看什么"和"如何编辑"被分开处理，导致依赖多个不连贯的模型。

Method: FOCUS采用双分支视觉编码器捕获全局语义和细粒度空间细节，结合MoVQGAN视觉分词器生成离散视觉标记，并通过多阶段训练管道优化分割掩码作为空间条件提示。

Result: 实验表明，FOCUS在多模态理解、参考分割准确性和可控图像生成等任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: FOCUS通过联合优化视觉感知和生成能力，有效弥合了分割感知与细粒度视觉合成之间的差距。

Abstract: Recent Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate promising
capabilities in unifying visual understanding and generative modeling, enabling
both accurate content understanding and flexible editing. However, current
approaches treat "what to see" and "how to edit" separately: they either
perform isolated object segmentation or utilize segmentation masks merely as
conditional prompts for local edit generation tasks, often relying on multiple
disjointed models. To bridge these gaps, we introduce FOCUS, a unified LVLM
that integrates segmentation-aware perception and controllable object-centric
generation within an end-to-end framework. FOCUS employs a dual-branch visual
encoder to simultaneously capture global semantic context and fine-grained
spatial details. In addition, we leverage a MoVQGAN-based visual tokenizer to
produce discrete visual tokens that enhance generation quality. To enable
accurate and controllable image editing, we propose a progressive multi-stage
training pipeline, where segmentation masks are jointly optimized and used as
spatial condition prompts to guide the diffusion decoder. This strategy aligns
visual encoding, segmentation, and generation modules, effectively bridging
segmentation-aware perception with fine-grained visual synthesis. Extensive
experiments across three core tasks, including multimodal understanding,
referring segmentation accuracy, and controllable image generation, demonstrate
that FOCUS achieves strong performance by jointly optimizing visual perception
and generative capabilities.

Result: 在DDL数据集上，Loupe以0.846的总分在IJCAI 2025挑战赛中取得第一名，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: Loupe通过补丁级融合和条件查询设计，显著提升了分类和定位性能。

Abstract: The proliferation of generative models has raised serious concerns about
visual content forgery. Existing deepfake detection methods primarily target
either image-level classification or pixel-wise localization. While some
achieve high accuracy, they often suffer from limited generalization across
manipulation types or rely on complex architectures. In this paper, we propose
Loupe, a lightweight yet effective framework for joint deepfake detection and
localization. Loupe integrates a patch-aware classifier and a segmentation
module with conditional queries, allowing simultaneous global authenticity
classification and fine-grained mask prediction. To enhance robustness against
distribution shifts of test set, Loupe introduces a pseudo-label-guided
test-time adaptation mechanism by leveraging patch-level predictions to
supervise the segmentation head. Extensive experiments on the DDL dataset
demonstrate that Loupe achieves state-of-the-art performance, securing the
first place in the IJCAI 2025 Deepfake Detection and Localization Challenge
with an overall score of 0.846. Our results validate the effectiveness of the
proposed patch-level fusion and conditional query design in improving both
classification accuracy and spatial localization under diverse forgery
patterns. The code is available at https://github.com/Kamichanw/Loupe.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自监督学习框架，用于增强足球机器人在动态环境中的球检测性能，无需大量手动标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督方法需要大量手动标注，成本高且耗时，因此需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 利用预训练模型生成伪标签，通过自监督任务（如着色、边缘检测和三元组损失）学习特征，并结合MAML策略快速适应新场景。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在准确性、F1分数和IoU上优于基线模型，且收敛更快。

Conclusion: 提出的自监督框架有效提升了球检测性能，并减少了对手动标注的依赖。

Abstract: Robust and accurate ball detection is a critical component for autonomous
humanoid soccer robots, particularly in dynamic and challenging environments
such as RoboCup outdoor fields. However, traditional supervised approaches
require extensive manual annotation, which is costly and time-intensive. To
overcome this problem, we present a self-supervised learning framework for
domain-adaptive feature extraction to enhance ball detection performance. The
proposed approach leverages a general-purpose pretrained model to generate
pseudo-labels, which are then used in a suite of self-supervised pretext tasks
-- including colorization, edge detection, and triplet loss -- to learn robust
visual features without relying on manual annotations. Additionally, a
model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) strategy is incorporated to ensure rapid
adaptation to new deployment scenarios with minimal supervision. A new dataset
comprising 10,000 labeled images from outdoor RoboCup SPL matches is
introduced, used to validate the method, and made available to the community.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed pipeline outperforms
baseline models in terms of accuracy, F1 score, and IoU, while also exhibiting
faster convergence.

Result: 在多个数据集和机器人平台上验证，性能优于GA-NAV和Off-seg。

Conclusion: AnyTraverse提供了一种车辆无关的越野可通行性方法，平衡了自动化和目标化人类监督。

Abstract: Off-road traversability segmentation enables autonomous navigation with
applications in search-and-rescue, military operations, wildlife exploration,
and agriculture. Current frameworks struggle due to significant variations in
unstructured environments and uncertain scene changes, and are not adaptive to
be used for different robot types. We present AnyTraverse, a framework
combining natural language-based prompts with human-operator assistance to
determine navigable regions for diverse robotic vehicles. The system segments
scenes for a given set of prompts and calls the operator only when encountering
previously unexplored scenery or unknown class not part of the prompt in its
region-of-interest, thus reducing active supervision load while adapting to
varying outdoor scenes. Our zero-shot learning approach eliminates the need for
extensive data collection or retraining. Our experimental validation includes
testing on RELLIS-3D, Freiburg Forest, and RUGD datasets and demonstrate
real-world deployment on multiple robot platforms. The results show that
AnyTraverse performs better than GA-NAV and Off-seg while offering a
vehicle-agnostic approach to off-road traversability that balances automation
with targeted human supervision.

Motivation: 现有圆形图案的投影模型在镜头畸变下存在偏差，导致性能不佳，需要改进。

Method: 提出无偏的圆形图案投影模型，引入不确定性，并基于马尔可夫随机场建模边界点。

Result: 新框架显著提高了标定精度和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法优于传统棋盘格标定，并提供了完整的源代码和演示视频。

Abstract: Camera calibration using planar targets has been widely favored, and two
types of control points have been mainly considered as measurements: the
corners of the checkerboard and the centroid of circles. Since a centroid is
derived from numerous pixels, the circular pattern provides more precise
measurements than the checkerboard. However, the existing projection model of
circle centroids is biased under lens distortion, resulting in low performance.
To surmount this limitation, we propose an unbiased projection model of the
circular pattern and demonstrate its superior accuracy compared to the
checkerboard. Complementing this, we introduce uncertainty into circular
patterns to enhance calibration robustness and completeness. Defining centroid
uncertainty improves the performance of calibration components, including
pattern detection, optimization, and evaluation metrics. We also provide
guidelines for performing good camera calibration based on the evaluation
metric. The core concept of this approach is to model the boundary points of a
two-dimensional shape as a Markov random field, considering its connectivity.
The shape distribution is propagated to the centroid uncertainty through an
appropriate shape representation based on the Green theorem. Consequently, the
resulting framework achieves marked gains in calibration accuracy and
robustness. The complete source code and demonstration video are available at

Conclusion: 该方法在视频头部替换中实现了无缝集成和灵活的表情控制。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion-based multi-condition
controllable framework for video head swapping, which seamlessly transplant a
human head from a static image into a dynamic video, while preserving the
original body and background of target video, and further allowing to tweak
head expressions and movements during swapping as needed. Existing
face-swapping methods mainly focus on localized facial replacement neglecting
holistic head morphology, while head-swapping approaches struggling with
hairstyle diversity and complex backgrounds, and none of these methods allow
users to modify the transplanted head expressions after swapping. To tackle
these challenges, our method incorporates several innovative strategies through
a unified latent diffusion paradigm. 1) Identity-preserving context fusion: We
propose a shape-agnostic mask strategy to explicitly disentangle foreground
head identity features from background/body contexts, combining hair
enhancement strategy to achieve robust holistic head identity preservation
across diverse hair types and complex backgrounds. 2) Expression-aware landmark
retargeting and editing: We propose a disentangled 3DMM-driven retargeting
module that decouples identity, expression, and head poses, minimizing the
impact of original expressions in input images and supporting expression
editing. While a scale-aware retargeting strategy is further employed to
minimize cross-identity expression distortion for higher transfer precision.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method excels in seamless background
integration while preserving the identity of the source portrait, as well as
showcasing superior expression transfer capabilities applicable to both real
and virtual characters.

Abstract: Autonomous parking plays a vital role in intelligent vehicle systems,
particularly in constrained urban environments where high-precision control is
required. While traditional rule-based parking systems struggle with
environmental uncertainties and lack adaptability in crowded or dynamic scenes,
human drivers demonstrate the ability to park intuitively without explicit
modeling. Inspired by this observation, we propose a Transformer-based
end-to-end framework for autonomous parking that learns from expert
demonstrations. The network takes as input surround-view camera images,
goal-point representations, ego vehicle motion, and pedestrian trajectories. It
outputs discrete control sequences including throttle, braking, steering, and
gear selection. A novel cross-attention module integrates BEV features with
target points, and a GRU-based pedestrian predictor enhances safety by modeling
dynamic obstacles. We validate our method on the CARLA 0.9.14 simulator in both
vertical and parallel parking scenarios. Experiments show our model achieves a
high success rate of 96.57\%, with average positional and orientation errors of
0.21 meters and 0.41 degrees, respectively. The ablation studies further
demonstrate the effectiveness of key modules such as pedestrian prediction and
goal-point attention fusion. The code and dataset will be released at:

Conclusion: 该方法在有限样本多模态学习中表现出高效性和广泛适用性，为资源受限领域提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Multimodal models have demonstrated powerful capabilities in complex tasks
requiring multimodal alignment including zero-shot classification and
cross-modal retrieval. However, existing models typically rely on millions of
paired multimodal samples, which are prohibitively expensive or infeasible to
obtain in many domains. In this work, we explore the feasibility of building
multimodal models with limited amount of paired data by aligning pretrained
unimodal foundation models. We show that high-quality alignment is possible
with as few as tens of thousands of paired samples$\unicode{x2013}$less than
$1\%$ of the data typically used in the field. To achieve this, we introduce
STRUCTURE, an effective regularization technique that preserves the
neighborhood geometry of the latent space of unimodal encoders. Additionally,
we show that aligning last layers is often suboptimal and demonstrate the
benefits of aligning the layers with the highest representational similarity
across modalities. These two components can be readily incorporated into
existing alignment methods, yielding substantial gains across 24 zero-shot
image classification and retrieval benchmarks, with average relative
improvement of $51.6\%$ in classification and $91.8\%$ in retrieval tasks. Our
results highlight the effectiveness and broad applicability of our framework
for limited-sample multimodal learning and offer a promising path forward for
resource-constrained domains.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为LunarLoc的全球定位方法，用于解决月球表面自主操作中的定位问题，通过实例分割提取地标并构建图表示，显著提高了定位精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在月球表面，传统的地球导航基础设施（如GPS）不可用，而自主操作（如机器人探索和基础设施部署）需要精确的位姿估计。现有的视觉惯性里程计（VIO）方法在长距离任务中会积累漂移误差。

Method: LunarLoc利用实例分割从立体图像中提取零样本的巨石地标，构建基于图的表示，并通过图论数据关联与参考地图对齐，实现无漂移的全球定位。

Result: 实验表明，LunarLoc在多会话全球定位中达到亚厘米级精度，显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: LunarLoc为月球全球定位提供了一种高精度解决方案，并公开了数据集以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: Global localization is necessary for autonomous operations on the lunar
surface where traditional Earth-based navigation infrastructure, such as GPS,
is unavailable. As NASA advances toward sustained lunar presence under the
Artemis program, autonomous operations will be an essential component of tasks
such as robotic exploration and infrastructure deployment. Tasks such as
excavation and transport of regolith require precise pose estimation, but
proposed approaches such as visual-inertial odometry (VIO) accumulate odometry
drift over long traverses. Precise pose estimation is particularly important
for upcoming missions such as the ISRU Pilot Excavator (IPEx) that rely on
autonomous agents to operate over extended timescales and varied terrain. To
help overcome odometry drift over long traverses, we propose LunarLoc, an
approach to global localization that leverages instance segmentation for
zero-shot extraction of boulder landmarks from onboard stereo imagery. Segment
detections are used to construct a graph-based representation of the terrain,
which is then aligned with a reference map of the environment captured during a
previous session using graph-theoretic data association. This method enables
accurate and drift-free global localization in visually ambiguous settings.
LunarLoc achieves sub-cm level accuracy in multi-session global localization
experiments, significantly outperforming the state of the art in lunar global
localization. To encourage the development of further methods for global
localization on the Moon, we release our datasets publicly with a playback
module: https://github.com/mit-acl/lunarloc-data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有OOD基准（如ImageNet-C）已不再适用于评估现代网络规模数据集训练的模型，因为其失真类型已被训练数据覆盖。

Method: 设计了六种新型失真类型构建LAION-C基准，并在最新模型上进行评估，同时通过心理物理实验比较人类与模型的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LAION-C为OOD鲁棒性评估提供了更合适的基准，揭示了模型在OOD泛化上的范式转变。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness is a desired property of computer vision
models. Improving model robustness requires high-quality signals from
robustness benchmarks to quantify progress. While various benchmark datasets
such as ImageNet-C were proposed in the ImageNet era, most ImageNet-C
corruption types are no longer OOD relative to today's large, web-scraped
datasets, which already contain common corruptions such as blur or JPEG
compression artifacts. Consequently, these benchmarks are no longer well-suited
for evaluating OOD robustness in the era of web-scale datasets. Indeed, recent
models show saturating scores on ImageNet-era OOD benchmarks, indicating that
it is unclear whether models trained on web-scale datasets truly become better
at OOD generalization or whether they have simply been exposed to the test
distortions during training. To address this, we introduce LAION-C as a
benchmark alternative for ImageNet-C. LAION-C consists of six novel distortion
types specifically designed to be OOD, even for web-scale datasets such as
LAION. In a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models, we find that
the LAION-C dataset poses significant challenges to contemporary models,
including MLLMs such as Gemini and GPT-4o. We additionally conducted a
psychophysical experiment to evaluate the difficulty of our corruptions for
human observers, enabling a comparison of models to lab-quality human
robustness data. We observe a paradigm shift in OOD generalization: from humans
outperforming models, to the best models now matching or outperforming the best
human observers.

TL;DR: Defusion提出了一种基于视觉指令引导降解扩散的全能图像修复框架，能够处理混合或未知的降解类型，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像修复方法通常需要针对每种降解类型单独设计模型，限制了其在真实场景中的泛化能力。

Method: Defusion通过构建明确的视觉指令来引导扩散模型，直接在降解空间中重建高质量图像。

Result: 实验表明，Defusion在多种图像修复任务中优于现有方法，包括复杂和真实世界的降解。

Conclusion: Defusion通过视觉指令引导的扩散方法，显著提升了图像修复的稳定性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Image restoration tasks like deblurring, denoising, and dehazing usually need
distinct models for each degradation type, restricting their generalization in
real-world scenarios with mixed or unknown degradations. In this work, we
propose \textbf{Defusion}, a novel all-in-one image restoration framework that
utilizes visual instruction-guided degradation diffusion. Unlike existing
methods that rely on task-specific models or ambiguous text-based priors,
Defusion constructs explicit \textbf{visual instructions} that align with the
visual degradation patterns. These instructions are grounded by applying
degradations to standardized visual elements, capturing intrinsic degradation
features while agnostic to image semantics. Defusion then uses these visual
instructions to guide a diffusion-based model that operates directly in the
degradation space, where it reconstructs high-quality images by denoising the
degradation effects with enhanced stability and generalizability. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that Defusion outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across diverse image restoration tasks, including complex and real-world
degradations.

TL;DR: ResFlow是一种新型图像恢复框架，通过确定性路径建模退化过程，显著提升了性能和速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成模型（如扩散和基于分数的模型）将退化过程视为随机变换，导致效率低下和复杂性增加。

Method: ResFlow使用连续归一化流对退化过程进行确定性建模，并通过辅助过程消除HQ预测的不确定性。

Result: ResFlow在不到四个采样步骤内完成任务，并在多个基准测试中达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: ResFlow为图像恢复提供了一种实用且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Image restoration aims to recover high-quality (HQ) images from degraded
low-quality (LQ) ones by reversing the effects of degradation. Existing
generative models for image restoration, including diffusion and score-based
models, often treat the degradation process as a stochastic transformation,
which introduces inefficiency and complexity. In this work, we propose ResFlow,
a novel image restoration framework that models the degradation process as a
deterministic path using continuous normalizing flows. ResFlow augments the
degradation process with an auxiliary process that disambiguates the
uncertainty in HQ prediction to enable reversible modeling of the degradation
process. ResFlow adopts entropy-preserving flow paths and learns the augmented
degradation flow by matching the velocity field. ResFlow significantly improves
the performance and speed of image restoration, completing the task in fewer
than four sampling steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ResFlow
achieves state-of-the-art results across various image restoration benchmarks,
offering a practical and efficient solution for real-world applications.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MICS的新方法，用于生成高质量的医疗推理链数据，并构建了多任务医疗推理数据集MMRP和新医疗MLLM模型Chiron-o1，实验证明其性能优越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的医疗多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在推理能力上存在不足，缺乏全面框架来搜索和评估有效的诊断推理路径。

Method: 提出MICS方法，通过导师模型初始化推理路径，实习生模型继续推理，并基于MICS-Score选择最优路径，构建MMRP数据集和Chiron-o1模型。

Result: 实验表明，基于MICS构建的CoT数据训练的Chiron-o1在多个医疗视觉问答和推理基准上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: MICS方法有效提升了医疗MLLMs的推理能力，Chiron-o1模型表现出色，为医疗领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have begun to demonstrate robust
reasoning capabilities on general tasks, yet their application in the medical
domain remains in its early stages. Constructing chain-of-thought (CoT)
training data is essential for bolstering the reasoning abilities of medical
MLLMs. However, existing approaches exhibit a deficiency in offering a
comprehensive framework for searching and evaluating effective reasoning paths
towards critical diagnosis. To address this challenge, we propose Mentor-Intern
Collaborative Search (MICS), a novel reasoning-path searching scheme to
generate rigorous and effective medical CoT data. MICS first leverages mentor
models to initialize the reasoning, one step at a time, then prompts each
intern model to continue the thinking along those initiated paths, and finally
selects the optimal reasoning path according to the overall reasoning
performance of multiple intern models. The reasoning performance is determined
by an MICS-Score, which assesses the quality of generated reasoning paths.
Eventually, we construct MMRP, a multi-task medical reasoning dataset with
ranked difficulty, and Chiron-o1, a new medical MLLM devised via a curriculum
learning strategy, with robust visual question-answering and generalizable
reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Chiron-o1,
trained on our CoT dataset constructed using MICS, achieves state-of-the-art
performance across a list of medical visual question answering and reasoning
benchmarks. Codes are available at GitHub - manglu097/Chiron-o1: Enhancing

Abstract: The segmentation of forest LiDAR 3D point clouds, including both individual
tree and semantic segmentation, is fundamental for advancing forest management
and ecological research. However, current approaches often struggle with the
complexity and variability of natural forest environments. We present
ForestFormer3D, a new unified and end-to-end framework designed for precise

combining these new components, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance
for individual tree segmentation on the newly introduced FOR-instanceV2
dataset, which spans diverse forest types and regions. Additionally,
ForestFormer3D generalizes well to unseen test sets (Wytham woods and LAUTx),
showcasing its robustness across different forest conditions and sensor
modalities. The FOR-instanceV2 dataset and the ForestFormer3D code will be
released soon.

TL;DR: Prmpt2Adpt是一种轻量级、高效的零样本域适应框架，通过提示驱动的特征对齐实现快速适应，适用于资源受限环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有无监督域适应方法依赖大型模型和完整源域数据的问题，提升在资源受限环境（如无人机）中的适用性。

Method: 基于教师-学生范式，使用蒸馏和微调的CLIP模型作为教师骨干，通过提示驱动的实例归一化对齐特征，生成高质量伪标签指导学生模型适应。

Result: 在MDS-A数据集上表现优异，适应速度快7倍，推理速度快5倍，且仅需少量源图像。

Conclusion: Prmpt2Adpt是一种实用且可扩展的解决方案，适用于低资源领域的实时适应。

Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) is a critical challenge in real-world
vision systems, especially in resource-constrained environments like drones,
where memory and computation are limited. Existing prompt-driven UDA methods
typically rely on large vision-language models and require full access to
source-domain data during adaptation, limiting their applicability. In this
work, we propose Prmpt2Adpt, a lightweight and efficient zero-shot domain
adaptation framework built around a teacher-student paradigm guided by
prompt-based feature alignment. At the core of our method is a distilled and
fine-tuned CLIP model, used as the frozen backbone of a Faster R-CNN teacher. A
small set of low-level source features is aligned to the target domain
semantics-specified only through a natural language prompt-via Prompt-driven
Instance Normalization (PIN). These semantically steered features are used to
briefly fine-tune the detection head of the teacher model. The adapted teacher
then generates high-quality pseudo-labels, which guide the on-the-fly
adaptation of a compact student model. Experiments on the MDS-A dataset
demonstrate that Prmpt2Adpt achieves competitive detection performance compared
to state-of-the-art methods, while delivering up to 7x faster adaptation and 5x
faster inference speed using few source images-making it a practical and
scalable solution for real-time adaptation in low-resource domains.

Motivation: 单车感知受限于遮挡、传感器范围和视角，协作感知能交换互补信息，提升感知的完整性和准确性。

Result: 基线模型在扩展预测范围时表现优于单车型，增益随范围扩大而增加。

Conclusion: 协作感知能有效提升3D语义占用预测的准确性和范围，为未来研究提供了数据集和基准。

Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction is an emerging perception paradigm in
autonomous driving, providing a voxel-level representation of both geometric
details and semantic categories. However, the perception capability of a single
vehicle is inherently constrained by occlusion, restricted sensor range, and
narrow viewpoints. To address these limitations, collaborative perception
enables the exchange of complementary information, thereby enhancing the
completeness and accuracy. In the absence of a dedicated dataset for
collaborative 3D semantic occupancy prediction, we augment an existing
collaborative perception dataset by replaying it in CARLA with a
high-resolution semantic voxel sensor to provide dense and comprehensive
occupancy annotations. In addition, we establish benchmarks with varying
prediction ranges designed to systematically assess the impact of spatial
extent on collaborative prediction. We further develop a baseline model that
performs inter-agent feature fusion via spatial alignment and attention
aggregation. Experimental results demonstrate that our baseline model
consistently outperforms single-agent models, with increasing gains observed as
the prediction range expands.

TL;DR: 提出TripleGAN框架，通过两个GAN组件分别处理模糊特性和退化模式，第三个GAN用于重建真实低分辨率图像，显著提升超分辨率重建性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 真实世界超分辨率重建依赖反映真实退化模式的数据集，但仅用低分辨率图像提取退化模式或合成数据集均无法完全捕捉模糊、噪声等特性。

Method: 设计TripleGAN框架，FirstGAN缩小模糊特性域差距，SecondGAN学习目标域模糊特性和退化模式，ThirdGAN基于伪真实数据重建真实低分辨率图像。

Result: 在RealSR和DRealSR数据集上，该方法在定量指标上表现优越，重建图像清晰且无过度平滑伪影。

Conclusion: TripleGAN能有效学习真实退化模式并合成对齐数据集，显著提升真实低分辨率图像的超分辨率重建质量。

Abstract: The training of real-world super-resolution reconstruction models heavily
relies on datasets that reflect real-world degradation patterns. Extracting and
modeling degradation patterns for super-resolution reconstruction using only
real-world low-resolution (LR) images remains a challenging task. When
synthesizing datasets to simulate real-world degradation, relying solely on
degradation extraction methods fails to capture both blur and diverse noise
characteristics across varying LR distributions, as well as more implicit
degradations such as color gamut shifts. Conversely, domain translation alone
cannot accurately approximate real-world blur characteristics due to the
significant degradation domain gap between synthetic and real data. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel TripleGAN framework comprising two
strategically designed components: The FirstGAN primarily focuses on narrowing
the domain gap in blur characteristics, while the SecondGAN performs
domain-specific translation to approximate target-domain blur properties and
learn additional degradation patterns. The ThirdGAN is trained on pseudo-real
data generated by the FirstGAN and SecondGAN to reconstruct real-world LR
images. Extensive experiments on the RealSR and DRealSR datasets demonstrate
that our method exhibits clear advantages in quantitative metrics while
maintaining sharp reconstructions without over-smoothing artifacts. The
proposed framework effectively learns real-world degradation patterns from LR
observations and synthesizes aligned datasets with corresponding degradation
characteristics, thereby enabling the trained network to achieve superior
performance in reconstructing high-quality SR images from real-world LR inputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解高级视觉单元编码的特征组合对于揭示图像如何转化为支持识别的表示至关重要，现有方法不足以揭示不变性变换的多样性。

Method: SnS将变换建模为双目标优化问题，通过图像扰动探究不变性和对抗敏感性。

Result: 在卷积神经网络中，SnS揭示了比仿射变换更远离参考图像但更能保持单元响应的图像变化，且不同网络层的优化选择导致不同的不变性图像特征。

Conclusion: SnS框架有效揭示了视觉单元的不变性特性，且鲁棒网络的输出更符合人类视觉系统的高保真模型。

Abstract: Uncovering which features' combinations high-level visual units encode is
critical to understand how images are transformed into representations that
support recognition. While existing feature visualization approaches typically
infer a unit's most exciting images, this is insufficient to reveal the
manifold of transformations under which responses remain invariant, which is
key to generalization in vision. Here we introduce Stretch-and-Squeeze (SnS),
an unbiased, model-agnostic, and gradient-free framework to systematically
characterize a unit's invariance landscape and its vulnerability to adversarial
perturbations in both biological and artificial visual systems. SnS frames
these transformations as bi-objective optimization problems. To probe
invariance, SnS seeks image perturbations that maximally alter the
representation of a reference stimulus in a given processing stage while
preserving unit activation. To probe adversarial sensitivity, SnS seeks
perturbations that minimally alter the stimulus while suppressing unit
activation. Applied to convolutional neural networks (CNNs), SnS revealed image
variations that were further from a reference image in pixel-space than those
produced by affine transformations, while more strongly preserving the target
unit's response. The discovered invariant images differed dramatically
depending on the choice of image representation used for optimization:
pixel-level changes primarily affected luminance and contrast, while stretching
mid- and late-layer CNN representations altered texture and pose respectively.
Notably, the invariant images from robust networks were more recognizable by
human subjects than those from standard networks, supporting the higher
fidelity of robust CNNs as models of the visual system.

Motivation: 传统Transformer在车牌识别中表现优异，但对未来车牌（语法变化）的识别性能显著下降，不适合实际生产环境。

Method: 通过分析Transformer编码器-解码器中位置和上下文信息的流动，提出架构改进（如切断和替换），并集成到SaLT模型中。

Result: 实验表明，SaLT在历史车牌上表现优异，同时在未来车牌上几乎保持相同性能，验证了其鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SaLT通过语法无关建模，显著提升了车牌识别的鲁棒性和适应性。

Abstract: Effective license plate recognition systems are required to be resilient to
constant change, as new license plates are released into traffic daily. While
Transformer-based networks excel in their recognition at first sight, we
observe significant performance drop over time which proves them unsuitable for
tense production environments. Indeed, such systems obtain state-of-the-art
results on plates whose syntax is seen during training. Yet, we show they
perform similarly to random guessing on future plates where legible characters
are wrongly recognized due to a shift in their syntax. After highlighting the
flows of positional and contextual information in Transformer encoder-decoders,
we identify several causes for their over-reliance on past syntax. Following,
we devise architectural cut-offs and replacements which we integrate into SaLT,
an attempt at a Syntax-Less Transformer for syntax-agnostic modeling of license
plate representations. Experiments on both real and synthetic datasets show
that our approach reaches top accuracy on past syntax and most importantly
nearly maintains performance on future license plates. We further demonstrate
the robustness of our architecture enhancements by way of various ablations.

Result: 在PartNet上实现最优性能，首次展示复杂真实世界对象的高质量组装。

Conclusion: Assembler为交互式和组合式设计提供了潜力，并能生成高分辨率可编辑对象。

Abstract: We present Assembler, a scalable and generalizable framework for 3D part
assembly that reconstructs complete objects from input part meshes and a
reference image. Unlike prior approaches that mostly rely on deterministic part
pose prediction and category-specific training, Assembler is designed to handle
diverse, in-the-wild objects with varying part counts, geometries, and
structures. It addresses the core challenges of scaling to general 3D part
assembly through innovations in task formulation, representation, and data.
First, Assembler casts part assembly as a generative problem and employs
diffusion models to sample plausible configurations, effectively capturing
ambiguities arising from symmetry, repeated parts, and multiple valid
assemblies. Second, we introduce a novel shape-centric representation based on
sparse anchor point clouds, enabling scalable generation in Euclidean space
rather than SE(3) pose prediction. Third, we construct a large-scale dataset of
over 320K diverse part-object assemblies using a synthesis and filtering
pipeline built on existing 3D shape repositories. Assembler achieves
state-of-the-art performance on PartNet and is the first to demonstrate
high-quality assembly for complex, real-world objects. Based on Assembler, we
further introduce an interesting part-aware 3D modeling system that generates
high-resolution, editable objects from images, demonstrating potential for
interactive and compositional design. Project page:

Result: 在DSI数据集上性能提升56.1%，KAA贡献31.3%，CAL贡献24.8%；在BDD100K和HSD数据集上表现优于SOTA模型，且数据使用量减少85%。

Conclusion: KAA-CAL系统有效解决了多标签分类的挑战，显著提升了自动驾驶场景识别的性能。

Abstract: Driving scene identification, which assigns multiple non-exclusive class
labels to a scene, provides the contextual awareness necessary for enhancing
autonomous vehicles' ability to understand, reason about, and interact with the
complex driving environment. As a multi-label classification problem, it is
better tackled via multitasking learning. However, directly training a
multi-label classification model for driving scene identification through
multitask learning presents two main challenges: acquiring a balanced,
comprehensively annotated multi-label dataset and balancing learning across
different tasks. This paper introduces a novel learning system that synergizes
knowledge acquisition and accumulation (KAA) with consistency-based active
learning (CAL) to address those challenges. KAA acquires and accumulates
knowledge about scene identification from various single-label datasets via
monotask learning. Subsequently, CAL effectively resolves the knowledge gap
caused by the discrepancy between the marginal distributions of individual
attributes and their joint distribution. An ablation study on our Driving Scene
Identification (DSI) dataset demonstrates a 56.1% performance increase over the
baseline model pretrained on ImageNet. Of this, KAA accounts for 31.3% of the
gain, and CAL contributes 24.8%. Moreover, KAA-CAL stands out as the best
performer when compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) multi-label models on two
public datasets, BDD100K and HSD, achieving this while using 85% less data. The
DSI dataset and the implementation code for KAA-CAL are available at

Conclusion: MEXA通过专家驱动的选择和聚合，实现了灵活、透明的多模态推理，无需额外训练开销。

Abstract: Combining pre-trained expert models offers substantial potential for scalable
multimodal reasoning, but building a unified framework remains challenging due
to the increasing diversity of input modalities and task complexity. For
instance, medical diagnosis requires precise reasoning over structured clinical
tables, while financial forecasting depends on interpreting plot-based data to
make informed predictions. To tackle this challenge, we introduce MEXA, a
training-free framework that performs modality- and task-aware aggregation of
multiple expert models to enable effective multimodal reasoning across diverse
and distinct domains. MEXA dynamically selects expert models based on the input
modality and the task-specific reasoning demands (i.e., skills). Each expert
model, specialized in a modality task pair, generates interpretable textual
reasoning outputs. MEXA then aggregates and reasons over these outputs using a
Large Reasoning Model (LRM) to produce the final answer. This modular design
allows flexible and transparent multimodal reasoning across diverse domains
without additional training overhead. We extensively evaluate our approach on
diverse multimodal benchmarks, including Video Reasoning, Audio Reasoning, 3D
Understanding, and Medical QA. MEXA consistently delivers performance
improvements over strong multimodal baselines, highlighting the effectiveness
and broad applicability of our expert-driven selection and aggregation in
diverse multimodal reasoning tasks.

Abstract: We introduce a robust framework, RGBTrack, for real-time 6D pose estimation

on the FoundationPose architecture, we devise a novel binary search strategy
combined with a render-and-compare mechanism to efficiently infer depth and
generate robust pose hypotheses from true-scale CAD models. To maintain stable
tracking in dynamic scenarios, including rapid movements and occlusions,
RGBTrack integrates state-of-the-art 2D object tracking (XMem) with a Kalman
filter and a state machine for proactive object pose recovery. In addition,
RGBTrack's scale recovery module dynamically adapts CAD models of unknown scale
using an initial depth estimate, enabling seamless integration with modern
generative reconstruction techniques. Extensive evaluations on benchmark
datasets demonstrate that RGBTrack's novel depth-free approach achieves
competitive accuracy and real-time performance, making it a promising practical
solution candidate for application areas including robotics, augmented reality,

Result: 实现了源识别和篡改检测，具有可控的敏感性与鲁棒性权衡。

Conclusion: pgSPAD成像器在数字水印中具有潜力，为安全特征提供了新方法。

Abstract: Digital image watermarks as a security feature can be derived from the
imager's physically unclonable functions (PUFs) by utilizing the manufacturing
variations, i.e., the dark signal non-uniformity (DSNU). While a few
demonstrations focused on the CMOS image sensors (CIS) and active pixel sensors
(APS), single photon avalanche diode (SPAD) imagers have never been
investigated for this purpose. In this work, we have proposed a novel
watermarking technique using perimeter gated SPAD (pgSPAD) imagers. We utilized
the DSNU of three 64 x 64 pgSPAD imager chips, fabricated in a 0.35 {\mu}m
standard CMOS process and analyzed the simulated watermarks for standard test
images from publicly available database. Our observation shows that both source
identification and tamper detection can be achieved using the proposed
source-scene-specific dynamic watermarks with a controllable
sensitivity-robustness trade-off.

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning addresses the issue of limited annotations in

improve the accuracy of medical image segmentation by providing complementary
information. However, they face challenges in achieving significant
improvements under semi-supervised conditions due to the challenge of
effectively leveraging unlabeled data. There is a significant need to create an
effective and reliable multi-modal learning strategy for leveraging unlabeled
data in semi-supervised segmentation. To address these issues, we propose a
novel semi-supervised multi-modal medical image segmentation approach, which
leverages complementary multi-modal information to enhance performance with
limited labeled data. Our approach employs a multi-stage multi-modal fusion and
enhancement strategy to fully utilize complementary multi-modal information,
while reducing feature discrepancies and enhancing feature sharing and
alignment. Furthermore, we effectively introduce contrastive mutual learning to
constrain prediction consistency across modalities, thereby facilitating the
robustness of segmentation results in semi-supervised tasks. Experimental
results on two multi-modal datasets demonstrate the superior performance and
robustness of the proposed framework, establishing its valuable potential for
solving medical image segmentation tasks in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Object counting models suffer when deployed across domains with differing
density variety, since density shifts are inherently task-relevant and violate
standard domain adaptation assumptions. To address this, we propose a
theoretical framework of conditional feature alignment. We first formalize the
notion of conditional divergence by partitioning each domain into subsets
(e.g., object vs. background) and measuring divergences per condition. We then
derive a joint error bound showing that, under discrete label spaces treated as
condition sets, aligning distributions conditionally leads to tighter bounds on
the combined source-target decision error than unconditional alignment. These
insights motivate a general conditional adaptation principle: by preserving
task-relevant variations while filtering out nuisance shifts, one can achieve
superior cross-domain generalization for counting. We provide both defining
conditional divergence then proving its benefit in lowering joint error and a
practical adaptation strategy that preserves task-relevant information in
unsupervised domain-adaptive counting. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach through extensive experiments on multiple counting datasets with
varying density distributions. The results show that our method outperforms
existing unsupervised domain adaptation methods, empirically validating the
theoretical insights on conditional feature alignment.

Result: 实验表明，这种基于语言的方法能有效检测关键比赛事件，且无需训练。

Conclusion: 该方法为动作识别提供了一种轻量级、无需训练的替代方案。

Abstract: Traditional video-based tasks like soccer action spotting rely heavily on
visual inputs, often requiring complex and computationally expensive models to
process dense video data. In this work, we propose a shift from this
video-centric approach to a text-based task, making it lightweight and scalable
by utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) instead of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs). We posit that expert commentary, which provides rich, fine-grained
descriptions and contextual cues such as excitement and tactical insights,
contains enough information to reliably spot key actions in a match. To
demonstrate this, we use the SoccerNet Echoes dataset, which provides
timestamped commentary, and employ a system of three LLMs acting as judges
specializing in outcome, excitement, and tactics. Each LLM evaluates sliding
windows of commentary to identify actions like goals, cards, and substitutions,
generating accurate timestamps for these events. Our experiments show that this
language-centric approach performs effectively in detecting critical match
events, providing a lightweight and training-free alternative to traditional
video-based methods for action spotting.

Conclusion: Co-Seg++通过任务协同显著提升了医学图像分割的性能和理解。

Abstract: Medical image analysis is critical yet challenged by the need of jointly
segmenting organs or tissues, and numerous instances for anatomical structures
and tumor microenvironment analysis. Existing studies typically formulated
different segmentation tasks in isolation, which overlooks the fundamental
interdependencies between these tasks, leading to suboptimal segmentation
performance and insufficient medical image understanding. To address this
issue, we propose a Co-Seg++ framework for versatile medical segmentation.
Specifically, we introduce a novel co-segmentation paradigm, allowing semantic
and instance segmentation tasks to mutually enhance each other. We first devise
a spatio-temporal prompt encoder (STP-Encoder) to capture long-range spatial
and temporal relationships between segmentation regions and image embeddings as
prior spatial constraints. Moreover, we devise a multi-task collaborative
decoder (MTC-Decoder) that leverages cross-guidance to strengthen the
contextual consistency of both tasks, jointly computing semantic and instance
segmentation masks. Extensive experiments on diverse CT and histopathology
datasets demonstrate that the proposed Co-Seg++ outperforms state-of-the-arts
in the semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation of dental anatomical
structures, histopathology tissues, and nuclei instances. The source code is

Abstract: Emotion recognition from facial images is a crucial task in human-computer
interaction, enabling machines to learn human emotions through facial
expressions. Previous studies have shown that facial images can be used to
train deep learning models; however, most of these studies do not include a
through dataset analysis. Visualizing facial landmarks can be challenging when
extracting meaningful dataset insights; to address this issue, we propose
facial landmark box plots, a visualization technique designed to identify
outliers in facial datasets. Additionally, we compare two sets of facial
landmark features: (i) the landmarks' absolute positions and (ii) their
displacements from a neutral expression to the peak of an emotional expression.
Our results indicate that a neural network achieves better performance than a
random forest classifier.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based and controllable video generation have
enabled high-quality and temporally coherent video synthesis, laying the
groundwork for immersive interactive gaming experiences. However, current
methods face limitations in dynamics, generality, long-term consistency, and
efficiency, which limit the ability to create various gameplay videos. To
address these gaps, we introduce Hunyuan-GameCraft, a novel framework for
high-dynamic interactive video generation in game environments. To achieve
fine-grained action control, we unify standard keyboard and mouse inputs into a
shared camera representation space, facilitating smooth interpolation between
various camera and movement operations. Then we propose a hybrid
history-conditioned training strategy that extends video sequences
autoregressively while preserving game scene information. Additionally, to
enhance inference efficiency and playability, we achieve model distillation to
reduce computational overhead while maintaining consistency across long
temporal sequences, making it suitable for real-time deployment in complex
interactive environments. The model is trained on a large-scale dataset
comprising over one million gameplay recordings across over 100 AAA games,
ensuring broad coverage and diversity, then fine-tuned on a carefully annotated
synthetic dataset to enhance precision and control. The curated game scene data
significantly improves the visual fidelity, realism and action controllability.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Hunyuan-GameCraft significantly
outperforms existing models, advancing the realism and playability of
interactive game video generation.

Conclusion: UniFork通过平衡共享学习和任务专业化，有效解决了统一模型中的模态对齐冲突。

Abstract: Unified image understanding and generation has emerged as a promising
paradigm in multimodal artificial intelligence. Despite recent progress, the
optimal architectural design for such unified models remains an open challenge.
In this work, we start by analyzing the modality alignment behaviors of
task-specific expert models for understanding and generation, as well as
current unified models. Our analysis reveals a crucial observation:
understanding tasks benefit from a progressively increasing modality alignment
across network depth, which helps build up semantic information for better
comprehension; In contrast, generation tasks follow a different trend: modality
alignment increases in the early layers but decreases in the deep layers to
recover spatial details. These divergent alignment patterns create a
fundamental conflict in fully shared Transformer backbones, where a uniform
representational flow often leads to performance compromises across two tasks.
Motivated by this finding, we introduce UniFork, a novel Y-shaped architecture
that shares the shallow layers for cross-task representation learning, while
employing task-specific branches in deeper layers to avoid task interference.
This design effectively balances shared learning and task specialization.
Through extensive ablation experiments, we demonstrate that Unifork
consistently outperforms conventional fully shared Transformer architectures,
and achieves performance on par with or better than task-specific models.

Conclusion: Part$^{2}$GS通过结合几何和物理约束，显著提升了关节物体建模的准确性和一致性。

Abstract: Articulated objects are common in the real world, yet modeling their
structure and motion remains a challenging task for 3D reconstruction methods.
In this work, we introduce Part$^{2}$GS, a novel framework for modeling
articulated digital twins of multi-part objects with high-fidelity geometry and
physically consistent articulation. Part$^{2}$GS leverages a part-aware 3D
Gaussian representation that encodes articulated components with learnable
attributes, enabling structured, disentangled transformations that preserve
high-fidelity geometry. To ensure physically consistent motion, we propose a
motion-aware canonical representation guided by physics-based constraints,
including contact enforcement, velocity consistency, and vector-field
alignment. Furthermore, we introduce a field of repel points to prevent part
collisions and maintain stable articulation paths, significantly improving
motion coherence over baselines. Extensive evaluations on both synthetic and
real-world datasets show that Part$^{2}$GS consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods by up to 10$\times$ in Chamfer Distance for movable
parts.

Abstract: An ideal traffic simulator replicates the realistic long-term point-to-point
trip that a self-driving system experiences during deployment. Prior models and
benchmarks focus on closed-loop motion simulation for initial agents in a

closed-loop motion simulation and scene generation mode. It enables stable
long-term rollout simulation. InfGen performs at the state-of-the-art in

methods in long-term (30s) simulation. The code and model of InfGen will be

Method: 提出Mirage框架，通过潜在视觉标记和文本标记交替解码，结合蒸馏学习和强化学习优化模型。

Result: 实验表明Mirage在多种基准测试中提升了多模态推理能力，且无需生成显式图像。

Conclusion: Mirage证明了潜在视觉标记在多模态推理中的有效性，为视觉语言模型提供了新思路。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at multimodal understanding, yet their
text-only decoding forces them to verbalize visual reasoning, limiting
performance on tasks that demand visual imagination. Recent attempts train VLMs
to render explicit images, but the heavy image-generation pre-training often
hinders the reasoning ability. Inspired by the way humans reason with mental
imagery-the internal construction and manipulation of visual cues-we
investigate whether VLMs can reason through interleaved multimodal trajectories
without producing explicit images. To this end, we present a Machine Mental
Imagery framework, dubbed as Mirage, which augments VLM decoding with latent
visual tokens alongside ordinary text. Concretely, whenever the model chooses
to ``think visually'', it recasts its hidden states as next tokens, thereby
continuing a multimodal trajectory without generating pixel-level images. Begin
by supervising the latent tokens through distillation from ground-truth image
embeddings, we then switch to text-only supervision to make the latent
trajectory align tightly with the task objective. A subsequent reinforcement
learning stage further enhances the multimodal reasoning capability.
Experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that Mirage unlocks stronger
multimodal reasoning without explicit image generation.

Conclusion: DiffTrack为理解视频DiTs的内部机制提供了重要见解，并为进一步研究和应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent advancements in video diffusion models based on Diffusion Transformers
(DiTs) have achieved remarkable success in generating temporally coherent
videos. Yet, a fundamental question persists: how do these models internally
establish and represent temporal correspondences across frames? We introduce
DiffTrack, the first quantitative analysis framework designed to answer this
question. DiffTrack constructs a dataset of prompt-generated video with pseudo
ground-truth tracking annotations and proposes novel evaluation metrics to
systematically analyze how each component within the full 3D attention
mechanism of DiTs (e.g., representations, layers, and timesteps) contributes to
establishing temporal correspondences. Our analysis reveals that query-key
similarities in specific, but not all, layers play a critical role in temporal
matching, and that this matching becomes increasingly prominent during the
denoising process. We demonstrate practical applications of DiffTrack in
zero-shot point tracking, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance
compared to existing vision foundation and self-supervised video models.
Further, we extend our findings to motion-enhanced video generation with a
novel guidance method that improves temporal consistency of generated videos
without additional training. We believe our work offers crucial insights into
the inner workings of video DiTs and establishes a foundation for further
research and applications leveraging their temporal understanding.

Conclusion: VLN-R1展示了LVLM在具身导航中的潜力，并通过创新的训练方法提升了性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) is a core challenge in embodied AI,
requiring agents to navigate real-world environments using natural language
instructions. Current language model-based navigation systems operate on
discrete topological graphs, limiting path planning to predefined node
connections. We propose VLN-R1, an end-to-end framework that leverages Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLM) to directly translate egocentric video streams
into continuous navigation actions, adopting GRPO-based training inspired by
DeepSeek-R1. To enable effective training, we first construct the VLN-Ego
dataset using a 3D simulator, Habitat, and propose Long-Short Memory Sampling
to balance historical and current observations. While large language models can
supervise complete textual instructions, they lack fine-grained action-level
control. Our framework employs a two-stage training approach: a) Supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) to align the model's action sequence text predictions with
expert demonstrations, followed by b) Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) enhanced
with a Time-Decayed Reward (TDR) mechanism that strategically weights
multi-step future actions. Experimental results show VLN-R1 achieves strong
performance on VLN-CE benchmark. VLN-R1 proves LVLMs can drive embodied
navigation and enhance task-specific reasoning through data-efficient,
reward-driven post-training.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态选择和集成多种检索器的方法（混合检索器），通过零样本加权组合，显著提升了检索增强生成的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常固定单一检索器，无法适应多样化信息需求，因此需要动态选择和集成不同检索器。

Method: 引入混合检索器框架，零样本加权组合异构检索器（如BM25和密集检索器）。

Result: 混合检索器性能优于单一检索器及更大模型（平均提升10.8%和3.9%），并能有效整合非专家人类信息源（性能提升58.9%）。

Conclusion: 混合检索器框架高效且灵活，为检索增强生成提供了新的优化方向。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) is powerful, but its effectiveness
hinges on which retrievers we use and how. Different retrievers offer distinct,
often complementary signals: BM25 captures lexical matches; dense retrievers,
semantic similarity. Yet in practice, we typically fix a single retriever based
on heuristics, which fails to generalize across diverse information needs. Can
we dynamically select and integrate multiple retrievers for each individual
query, without the need for manual selection? In our work, we validate this
intuition with quantitative analysis and introduce mixture of retrievers: a
zero-shot, weighted combination of heterogeneous retrievers. Extensive
experiments show that such mixtures are effective and efficient: Despite
totaling just 0.8B parameters, this mixture outperforms every individual
retriever and even larger 7B models by +10.8% and +3.9% on average,
respectively. Further analysis also shows that this mixture framework can help
incorporate specialized non-oracle human information sources as retrievers to
achieve good collaboration, with a 58.9% relative performance improvement over
simulated humans alone.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在专业领域中，标注查询-文档对的成本高且难以获取，因此需要自监督学习方法来训练检索器。

Conclusion: Revela展示了自监督检索器学习的有效性和可扩展性，为专业领域的检索任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Dense retrievers play a vital role in accessing external and specialized
knowledge to augment language models (LMs). Training dense retrievers typically
requires annotated query-document pairs, which are costly and hard to obtain in
specialized domains such as code-motivating growing interest in self-supervised
retriever learning. Since LMs are trained to capture token-level dependencies
through a self-supervised learning objective (i.e., next-token prediction), we
can analogously cast retrieval as learning dependencies among chunks of tokens.
This analogy naturally leads to the question: How can we adapt self-supervised
learning objectives in the spirit of language modeling to train retrievers?
  To answer this question, we introduce Revela, a unified and scalable training
framework for self-supervised retriever learning via language modeling. Revela
models semantic dependencies among documents by conditioning next-token
prediction on both local and cross-document context through an in-batch
attention mechanism. This attention is weighted by retriever-computed
similarity scores, enabling the retriever to be optimized as part of language
modeling. We evaluate Revela on both general-domain (BEIR) and domain-specific
(CoIR) benchmarks across various retriever backbones. At a comparable parameter
scale, Revela outperforms the previous best method with absolute improvements
of 5.2 % (18.3 % relative) and 5.6 % (14.4 % relative) on NDCG@10,
respectively, underscoring its effectiveness. Performance increases with model
size, highlighting both the scalability of our approach and its promise for
self-supervised retriever learning.

Conclusion: GFlowGR是一种有前景的方法，能够提升生成推荐的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Generative recommendations (GR), which usually include item tokenizers and
generative Large Language Models (LLMs), have demonstrated remarkable success
across a wide range of scenarios. The majority of existing research efforts
primarily concentrate on developing powerful item tokenizers or advancing LLM
decoding strategies to attain superior performance. However, the critical
fine-tuning step in GR frameworks, which is essential for adapting LLMs to
recommendation data, remains largely unexplored. Current approaches
predominantly rely on either the next-token prediction loss of supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) or recommendationspecific direct preference optimization
(DPO) strategies. Both methods ignore the exploration of possible positive
unobserved samples, which is commonly referred to as the exposure bias problem.
To mitigate this problem, this paper treats the GR as a multi-step generation
task and constructs a GFlowNets-based fine-tuning framework (GFlowGR). The
proposed framework integrates collaborative knowledge from traditional
recommender systems to create an adaptive trajectory sampler and a

GFlowNets, along with sampling and heuristic weighting techniques, GFlowGR

Motivation: 生成式检索推荐在大规模系统中面临令牌空间冗余和规模庞大的问题，现有重建量化方法无法有效区分项目。多模态信息的整合也缺乏有效方法。

Method: 提出SimCIT框架，采用可学习的残差量化模块，结合对比学习，对齐多模态信号并实现语义令牌化。

Conclusion: SimCIT通过对比学习解决了多模态信息整合和语义令牌化的挑战，提升了生成式推荐的性能。

Abstract: Generative retrieval-based recommendation has emerged as a promising paradigm
aiming at directly generating the identifiers of the target candidates.
However, in large-scale recommendation systems, this approach becomes
increasingly cumbersome due to the redundancy and sheer scale of the token
space. To overcome these limitations, recent research has explored the use of
semantic tokens as an alternative to ID tokens, which typically leveraged
reconstruction-based strategies, like RQ-VAE, to quantize content embeddings
and significantly reduce the embedding size. However, reconstructive
quantization aims for the precise reconstruction of each item embedding
independently, which conflicts with the goal of generative retrieval tasks
focusing more on differentiating among items. Moreover, multi-modal side
information of items, such as descriptive text and images, geographical
knowledge in location-based recommendation services, has been shown to be
effective in improving recommendations by providing richer contexts for
interactions. Nevertheless, effectively integrating such complementary
knowledge into existing generative recommendation frameworks remains
challenging. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel unsupervised deep
quantization exclusively based on contrastive learning, named SimCIT (a Simple
Contrastive Item Tokenization framework). Specifically, different from existing
reconstruction-based strategies, SimCIT propose to use a learnable residual
quantization module to align with the signals from different modalities of the
items, which combines multi-modal knowledge alignment and semantic tokenization
in a mutually beneficial contrastive learning framework. Extensive experiments
across public datasets and a large-scale industrial dataset from various
domains demonstrate SimCIT's effectiveness in LLM-based generative
recommendation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖初始3D重建阶段，计算成本高且重建质量不佳，需要更高效的解决方案。

Result: VEIGAR在重建质量和跨视角一致性上达到新SOTA，训练时间减少三倍。

Conclusion: VEIGAR在效率和效果上优于现有方法，为NVS任务提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Novel View Synthesis (NVS) and 3D generation have
significantly improved editing tasks, with a primary emphasis on maintaining
cross-view consistency throughout the generative process. Contemporary methods
typically address this challenge using a dual-strategy framework: performing
consistent 2D inpainting across all views guided by embedded priors either
explicitly in pixel space or implicitly in latent space; and conducting 3D
reconstruction with additional consistency guidance. Previous strategies, in
particular, often require an initial 3D reconstruction phase to establish
geometric structure, introducing considerable computational overhead. Even with
the added cost, the resulting reconstruction quality often remains suboptimal.
In this paper, we present VEIGAR, a computationally efficient framework that
outperforms existing methods without relying on an initial reconstruction
phase. VEIGAR leverages a lightweight foundation model to reliably align priors
explicitly in the pixel space. In addition, we introduce a novel supervision
strategy based on scale-invariant depth loss, which removes the need for
traditional scale-and-shift operations in monocular depth regularization.
Through extensive experimentation, VEIGAR establishes a new state-of-the-art
benchmark in reconstruction quality and cross-view consistency, while achieving
a threefold reduction in training time compared to the fastest existing method,
highlighting its superior balance of efficiency and effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前结构着色模型依赖密集的预处理数据，缺乏对隐式神经表示的全面研究，需要更高效的方法。

Method: 采用MLP进行数据压缩和建模，结合领域和范围特性，避免过拟合并具有稳健的重采样行为。

Result: 通过PSNR、SSIM和FLIP评估，高质量重建地面真实数据，内存占用减少两个数量级，性能显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持主观相似结果的同时，显著提高了效率和压缩率，适用于衍射表面渲染。

Abstract: Structural coloration is commonly modeled using wave optics for reliable and
photorealistic rendering of natural, quasi-periodic and complex nanostructures.
Such models often rely on dense, preliminary or preprocessed data to accurately
capture the nuanced variations in diffractive surface reflectances. This heavy
data dependency warrants implicit neural representation which has not been
addressed comprehensively in the current literature. In this paper, we present
a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) based method for data-driven rendering of
diffractive surfaces with high accuracy and efficiency. We primarily approach
this problem from a data compression perspective to devise a nuanced training
and modeling method which is attuned to the domain and range characteristics of
diffractive reflectance datasets. Importantly, our approach avoids over-fitting
and has robust resampling behavior. Using Peak-Signal-to-Noise (PSNR),
Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) and a flipping difference evaluator
(FLIP) as evaluation metrics, we demonstrate the high-quality reconstruction of
the ground-truth. In comparison to a recent state-of-the-art offline,
wave-optical, forward modeling approach, our method reproduces subjectively
similar results with significant performance gains. We reduce the memory
footprint of the raw datasets by two orders of magnitude in general. Lastly, we
depict the working of our method with actual surface renderings.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的曲率代理方法，用于神经符号距离场（SDF）的几何学习，避免了昂贵的高斯曲率惩罚，降低了计算和内存开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高斯曲率惩罚需要完整的Hessian矩阵计算和二阶自动微分，计算和内存成本高。

Method: 提出了两种曲率代理方法：(i) 有限差分代理，用四个前向SDF评估和一个一阶梯度代替Hessian矩阵；(ii) 自动微分代理，通过Hessian-向量积计算混合导数，避免完整Hessian矩阵组装。

Result: 在ABC基准测试中，代理方法与基于Hessian的基线方法重建精度相当或更高，同时GPU内存使用和运行时间减少了一半。

Conclusion: 该方法为工程级形状重建提供了可扩展、曲率感知的SDF学习路径。

Abstract: Neural signed-distance fields (SDFs) have become a versatile backbone for
geometric learning, yet enforcing developable, CAD-style behavior still hinges
on Gaussian curvature penalties that require full Hessian evaluation and
second-order automatic differentiation, both of which are costly in memory and
runtime. We present a curvature proxy that regularizes only the mixed
second-order term (Weingarten term), allowing the two principal curvatures to
adapt freely to data while suppressing unwanted warp. Two complementary
instantiations realize this idea: (i) a finite-difference proxy that replaces
each Hessian entry with four forward SDF evaluations and a single first-order
gradient, and (ii) an autodiff proxy that computes the same mixed derivative
via one Hessian-vector product, sidestepping explicit full Hessian assembly and
remaining faster in practice. Both variants converge to the exact mixed second
derivative, thus preserving the intended geometric bias without incurring full
second-order graphs. On the ABC benchmarks, the proxies match or exceed the
reconstruction fidelity of Hessian-based baselines while reducing GPU memory
use and wall-clock time by a factor of two. Because the method is drop-in and
framework-agnostic, it opens a practical path toward scalable, curvature-aware
SDF learning for engineering-grade shape reconstruction.

Conclusion: 该研究结合流体动力学、PDE理论和深度学习，为基于扩散的图像生成提供了新视角。

Abstract: We propose a novel PDE-driven corruption process for generative image
synthesis based on advection-diffusion processes which generalizes existing
PDE-based approaches. Our forward pass formulates image corruption via a
physically motivated PDE that couples directional advection with isotropic
diffusion and Gaussian noise, controlled by dimensionless numbers (Peclet,
Fourier). We implement this PDE numerically through a GPU-accelerated custom
Lattice Boltzmann solver for fast evaluation. To induce realistic turbulence,
we generate stochastic velocity fields that introduce coherent motion and
capture multi-scale mixing. In the generative process, a neural network learns
to reverse the advection-diffusion operator thus constituting a novel
generative model. We discuss how previous methods emerge as specific cases of
our operator, demonstrating that our framework generalizes prior PDE-based
corruption techniques. We illustrate how advection improves the diversity and
quality of the generated images while keeping the overall color palette
unaffected. This work bridges fluid dynamics, dimensionless PDE theory, and
deep generative modeling, offering a fresh perspective on physically informed
image corruption processes for diffusion-based synthesis.

Conclusion: 多平面同步技术有效提升了2D模型在全景领域的适用性，DreamCube模型实现了高质量3D全景生成。

Abstract: 3D panorama synthesis is a promising yet challenging task that demands
high-quality and diverse visual appearance and geometry of the generated
omnidirectional content. Existing methods leverage rich image priors from
pre-trained 2D foundation models to circumvent the scarcity of 3D panoramic
data, but the incompatibility between 3D panoramas and 2D single views limits
their effectiveness. In this work, we demonstrate that by applying multi-plane
synchronization to the operators from 2D foundation models, their capabilities
can be seamlessly extended to the omnidirectional domain. Based on this design,
we further introduce DreamCube, a multi-plane RGB-D diffusion model for 3D
panorama generation, which maximizes the reuse of 2D foundation model priors to
achieve diverse appearances and accurate geometry while maintaining multi-view
consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in panoramic image generation, panoramic depth estimation, and 3D
scene generation.

Result: 方法在高维度和复杂非线性代理-环境交互中有效扩展，同时保证无限时域时序逻辑的确定性。

Conclusion: 通过牺牲保守性换取可扩展性，方法在实际案例（如高维车辆交叉口）中表现优异。

Abstract: The requirement for identifying accurate system representations has not only
been a challenge to fulfill, but it has compromised the scalability of formal
methods, as the resulting models are often too complex for effective decision
making with formal correctness and performance guarantees. Focusing on
probabilistic simulation relations and surrogate models of stochastic systems,
we propose an approach that significantly enhances the scalability and
practical applicability of such simulation relations by eliminating the need to
compute error bounds directly. As a result, we provide an abstraction-based
technique that scales effectively to higher dimensions while addressing complex
nonlinear agent-environment interactions with infinite-horizon temporal logic
guarantees amidst uncertainty. Our approach trades scalability for conservatism
favorably, as demonstrated on a complex high-dimensional vehicle intersection
case study.

Abstract: As conversational agents increasingly engage in emotionally supportive
dialogue, it is important to understand how closely their interactions resemble
those in traditional therapy settings. This study investigates whether the
concerns shared with a robot align with those shared in human-to-human (H2H)
therapy sessions, and whether robot responses semantically mirror those of
human therapists. We analyzed two datasets: one of interactions between users
and professional therapists (Hugging Face's NLP Mental Health Conversations),
and another involving supportive conversations with a social robot (QTrobot
from LuxAI) powered by a large language model (LLM, GPT-3.5). Using sentence
embeddings and K-means clustering, we assessed cross-agent thematic alignment
by applying a distance-based cluster-fitting method that evaluates whether
responses from one agent type map to clusters derived from the other, and
validated it using Euclidean distances. Results showed that 90.88% of robot
conversation disclosures could be mapped to clusters from the human therapy
dataset, suggesting shared topical structure. For matched clusters, we compared
the subjects as well as therapist and robot responses using Transformer,
Word2Vec, and BERT embeddings, revealing strong semantic overlap in subjects'
disclosures in both datasets, as well as in the responses given to similar
human disclosure themes across agent types (robot vs. human therapist). These
findings highlight both the parallels and boundaries of robot-led support
conversations and their potential for augmenting mental health interventions.

Abstract: Imagine unlocking the power of the mind to communicate, create, and even
interact with the world around us. Recent breakthroughs in Artificial
Intelligence (AI), especially in how machines "see" and "understand" language,
are now fueling exciting progress in decoding brain signals from scalp
electroencephalography (EEG). Prima facie, this opens the door to revolutionary
brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) designed for real life, moving beyond
traditional uses to envision Brain-to-Speech, Brain-to-Image, and even a
Brain-to-Internet of Things (BCIoT).
  However, the journey is not as straightforward as it was for Computer Vision
(CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Applying AI to real-world EEG-based
BCIs, particularly in building powerful foundational models, presents unique
and intricate hurdles that could affect their reliability.
  Here, we unfold a guided exploration of this dynamic and rapidly evolving
research area. Rather than barely outlining a map of current endeavors and
results, the goal is to provide a principled navigation of this hot and
cutting-edge research landscape. We consider the basic paradigms that emerge
from a causal perspective and the attendant challenges presented to AI-based
models. Looking ahead, we then discuss promising research avenues that could
overcome today's technological, methodological, and ethical limitations. Our
aim is to lay out a clear roadmap for creating truly practical and effective
EEG-based BCI solutions that can thrive in everyday environments.

Motivation: 当前VSA的清理步骤计算复杂度高，成为瓶颈，需要更高效的解决方案。

Result: 清理时间复杂度为O(N log N)，空间复杂度为O(N)，码本存储空间为O(log N)。

Conclusion: 新方法显著提升了VSA的可扩展性，实验验证了其高效性。

Abstract: A computational bottleneck in current Vector-Symbolic Architectures (VSAs) is
the ``clean-up'' step, which decodes the noisy vectors retrieved from the
architecture. Clean-up typically compares noisy vectors against a ``codebook''
of prototype vectors, incurring computational complexity that is quadratic or
similar. We present a new codebook representation that supports efficient
clean-up, based on Kroneker products of rotation-like matrices. The resulting
clean-up time complexity is linearithmic, i.e. $\mathcal{O}(N\,\text{log}\,N)$,
where $N$ is the vector dimension and also the number of vectors in the
codebook. Clean-up space complexity is $\mathcal{O}(N)$. Furthermore, the
codebook is not stored explicitly in computer memory: It can be represented in
$\mathcal{O}(\text{log}\,N)$ space, and individual vectors in the codebook can
be materialized in $\mathcal{O}(N)$ time and space. At the same time,
asymptotic memory capacity remains comparable to standard approaches. Computer
experiments confirm these results, demonstrating several orders of magnitude
more scalability than baseline VSA techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多针对特定任务或模型，缺乏跨大模型的通用特征编码方法，特征分布的多样性限制了压缩效率和跨模型泛化能力。

Method: 提出了一种学习峰值到平衡的分布变换方法，非均匀、数据驱动且即插即用，无需修改下游编解码器即可对齐异构分布。

Conclusion: 该方法为通用特征编码提供了有效解决方案，代码将开源以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Like image coding in visual data transmission, feature coding is essential
for the distributed deployment of large models by significantly reducing
transmission and storage overhead. However, prior studies have mostly targeted
task- or model-specific scenarios, leaving the challenge of universal feature
coding across diverse large models largely unaddressed. In this paper, we
present the first systematic study on universal feature coding for large
models. The key challenge lies in the inherently diverse and distributionally
incompatible nature of features extracted from different models. For example,
features from DINOv2 exhibit highly peaky, concentrated distributions, while
those from Stable Diffusion 3 (SD3) are more dispersed and uniform. This
distributional heterogeneity severely hampers both compression efficiency and
cross-model generalization. To address this, we propose a learned
peaky-to-balanced distribution transformation, which reshapes highly skewed
feature distributions into a common, balanced target space. This transformation
is non-uniform, data-driven, and plug-and-play, enabling effective alignment of
heterogeneous distributions without modifying downstream codecs. With this
alignment, a universal codec trained on the balanced target distribution can
effectively generalize to features from different models and tasks. We validate
our approach on three representative large models-LLaMA3, DINOv2, and
SD3-across multiple tasks and modalities. Extensive experiments show that our
method achieves notable improvements in both compression efficiency and
cross-model generalization over task-specific baselines. All source code will
be released for future research.

Conclusion: 监督学习可突破传统热力学测量限制，有望实现量子气体实验的实时分析，提高测量精度。

Abstract: Precise determination of thermodynamic parameters in ultracold Bose gases
remains challenging due to the destructive nature of conventional measurement
techniques and inherent experimental uncertainties. We demonstrate an
artificial intelligence approach for rapid, non-destructive estimation of the
chemical potential and temperature from single-shot, in situ imaged density
profiles of finite-temperature Bose gases. Our convolutional neural network is
trained exclusively on quasi-2D `pancake' condensates in harmonic trap
configurations. It achieves parameter extraction within fractions of a second.
The model also demonstrates zero-shot generalisation across both trap geometry
and thermalisation dynamics, successfully estimating thermodynamic parameters
for toroidally trapped condensates with errors of only a few nanokelvin despite
no prior exposure to such geometries during training, and maintaining
predictive accuracy during dynamic thermalisation processes after a relatively
brief evolution without explicit training on non-equilibrium states. These
results suggest that supervised learning can overcome traditional limitations
in ultracold atom thermometry, with extension to broader geometric
configurations, temperature ranges, and additional parameters potentially
enabling comprehensive real-time analysis of quantum gas experiments. Such
capabilities could significantly streamline experimental workflows whilst
improving measurement precision across a range of quantum fluid systems.

Abstract: Generative AI (GAI) technologies are quickly reshaping the educational
landscape. As adoption accelerates, understanding how students and educators
perceive these tools is essential. This study presents one of the most
comprehensive analyses to date of stakeholder discourse dynamics on GAI in
education using social media data. Our dataset includes 1,199 Reddit posts and
13,959 corresponding top-level comments. We apply sentiment analysis, topic
modeling, and author classification. To support this, we propose and validate a
modular framework that leverages prompt-based large language models (LLMs) for
analysis of online social discourse, and we evaluate this framework against
classical natural language processing (NLP) models. Our GPT-4o pipeline
consistently outperforms prior approaches across all tasks. For example, it
achieved 90.6% accuracy in sentiment analysis against gold-standard human
annotations. Topic extraction uncovered 12 latent topics in the public
discourse with varying sentiment and author distributions. Teachers and
students convey optimism about GAI's potential for personalized learning and
productivity in higher education. However, key differences emerged: students
often voice distress over false accusations of cheating by AI detectors, while
teachers generally express concern about job security, academic integrity, and
institutional pressures to adopt GAI tools. These contrasting perspectives
highlight the tension between innovation and oversight in GAI-enabled learning
environments. Our findings suggest a need for clearer institutional policies,
more transparent GAI integration practices, and support mechanisms for both
educators and students. More broadly, this study demonstrates the potential of
LLM-based frameworks for modeling stakeholder discourse within online
communities.

TL;DR: 研究探索了自监督学习特征及其量化表示在改善构音障碍语音转换中的效果，提出了一种基于条件流匹配和扩散变换器的非自回归方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构音障碍严重影响语音清晰度，需要开发有效的语音转换技术以改善沟通。

Method: 使用自监督学习特征（如WavLM）和量化表示替代传统mel频谱图，提出基于条件流匹配和扩散变换器的非自回归方法。

Result: 离散声学单元显著提高语音清晰度，且收敛速度优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 自监督学习特征和量化表示在构音障碍语音转换中具有潜力，非自回归方法效果显著。

Abstract: Dysarthria is a neurological disorder that significantly impairs speech
intelligibility, often rendering affected individuals unable to communicate
effectively. This necessitates the development of robust dysarthric-to-regular
speech conversion techniques. In this work, we investigate the utility and
limitations of self-supervised learning (SSL) features and their quantized
representations as an alternative to mel-spectrograms for speech generation.
Additionally, we explore methods to mitigate speaker variability by generating
clean speech in a single-speaker voice using features extracted from WavLM. To
this end, we propose a fully non-autoregressive approach that leverages
Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) with Diffusion Transformers to learn a direct
mapping from dysarthric to clean speech. Our findings highlight the
effectiveness of discrete acoustic units in improving intelligibility while
achieving faster convergence compared to traditional mel-spectrogram-based
approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然LLM在EDA中的生成任务中表现优异，但嵌入任务（如代码搜索、功能等价性检查和性能预测）被忽视，这些任务对硬件设计流程至关重要。

Method: 提出DeepRTL2，一个同时处理生成和嵌入任务的LLM家族，覆盖RTL相关任务。

Result: 实验表明，DeepRTL2在所有评估任务中均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: DeepRTL2填补了EDA中嵌入任务的空白，为硬件设计提供了全面的解决方案。

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into electronic design
automation (EDA) has significantly advanced the field, offering transformative
benefits, particularly in register transfer level (RTL) code generation and
understanding. While previous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of
fine-tuning LLMs for these generation-based tasks, embedding-based tasks, which
are equally critical to EDA workflows, have been largely overlooked. These
tasks, including natural language code search, RTL code functionality
equivalence checking, and performance prediction, are essential for
accelerating and optimizing the hardware design process. To address this gap,
we present DeepRTL2, a family of versatile LLMs that unifies both generation-
and embedding-based tasks related to RTL. By simultaneously tackling a broad
range of tasks, DeepRTL2 represents the first model to provide a comprehensive
solution to the diverse challenges in EDA. Through extensive experiments, we
show that DeepRTL2 achieves state-of-the-art performance across all evaluated
tasks.

Artificial Intelligence by enabling quantum and AI at various levels of

Quantum Neural Networks for multimodal sensor fusion, Nav-Q for Quantum
reinforcement learning for navigation policy optimization and finally
post-quantum cryptographic protocols for secure communication. Quantum neural
networks uses quantum amplitude encoding to fuse data from various sensors like
LiDAR, radar, camera, GPS and weather etc., This approach gives a unified
quantum state representation between heterogeneous sensor modalities. Nav-Q
module processes the fused quantum states through variational quantum circuits
to learn optimal navigation policies under swift dynamic and complex
conditions. Finally, post quantum cryptographic protocols are used to secure
communication channels for both within vehicle communication and V2X (Vehicle
to Everything) communications and thus secures the autonomous vehicle
communication from both classical and quantum security threats. Thus, the
proposed framework addresses fundamental challenges in autonomous vehicles
navigation by providing quantum performance and future proof security. Index

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于ODE的TTS生成需要大量步骤，导致质量与推理速度的权衡。RapFlow-TTS旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用速度一致性约束、时间间隔调度和对抗学习技术，优化流匹配训练。

Result: 实验表明，RapFlow-TTS在5倍和10倍减少生成步骤的情况下，仍能实现高保真语音合成。

Conclusion: RapFlow-TTS在减少生成步骤的同时保持了高质量的语音合成效果。

Abstract: We introduce RapFlow-TTS, a rapid and high-fidelity TTS acoustic model that
leverages velocity consistency constraints in flow matching (FM) training.
Although ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based TTS generation achieves
natural-quality speech, it typically requires a large number of generation
steps, resulting in a trade-off between quality and inference speed. To address
this challenge, RapFlow-TTS enforces consistency in the velocity field along
the FM-straightened ODE trajectory, enabling consistent synthetic quality with
fewer generation steps. Additionally, we introduce techniques such as time
interval scheduling and adversarial learning to further enhance the quality of
the few-step synthesis. Experimental results show that RapFlow-TTS achieves
high-fidelity speech synthesis with a 5- and 10-fold reduction in synthesis
steps than the conventional FM- and score-based approaches, respectively.

Motivation: 传统系外行星分类方法耗费资源且效率低，需要更高效的机器学习技术来提升分类效率。

Method: 将光变曲线数据转换为GAFs和RPs，使用ViT模型进行分类，并通过5折交叉验证评估性能。

Abstract: The classification of exoplanets has been a longstanding challenge in
astronomy, requiring significant computational and observational resources.
Traditional methods demand substantial effort, time, and cost, highlighting the
need for advanced machine learning techniques to enhance classification
efficiency. In this study, we propose a methodology that transforms raw light
curve data from NASA's Kepler mission into Gramian Angular Fields (GAFs) and
Recurrence Plots (RPs) using the Gramian Angular Difference Field and
recurrence plot techniques. These transformed images serve as inputs to the
Vision Transformer (ViT) model, leveraging its ability to capture intricate
temporal dependencies. We assess the performance of the model through recall,
precision, and F1 score metrics, using a 5-fold cross-validation approach to
obtain a robust estimate of the model's performance and reduce evaluation bias.
Our comparative analysis reveals that RPs outperform GAFs, with the ViT model
achieving an 89.46$\%$ recall and an 85.09$\%$ precision rate, demonstrating
its significant capability in accurately identifying exoplanetary transits.
Despite using under-sampling techniques to address class imbalance, dataset
size reduction remains a limitation. This study underscores the importance of
further research into optimizing model architectures to enhance automation,
performance, and generalization of the model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SGD训练神经网络存在计算成本高和易陷入局部最优的问题，因此研究PSO和GA作为替代方法。

Method: 开发了混合PSO-SGD策略，结合了PSO和SGD的优势。

Result: 混合PSO-SGD方法将训练MSE中值降低了90-95%，优于传统GA和PSO。RMHC也显著降低了MSE。

Conclusion: 混合和进化方法显著提升了训练效率和准确性，支持了Building Block Hypothesis的假设。

Abstract: Training Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) with Stochastic Gradient Descent
(SGD) frequently encounters difficulties, including substantial computing
expense and the risk of converging to local optima, attributable to its
dependence on partial weight gradients. Therefore, this work investigates
Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Genetic Algorithms (GAs) - two
population-based Metaheuristic Optimizers (MHOs) - as alternatives to SGD to
mitigate these constraints. A hybrid PSO-SGD strategy is developed to improve
local search efficiency. The findings indicate that the hybrid PSO-SGD
technique decreases the median training MSE by 90 to 95 percent relative to
conventional GA and PSO across various network sizes (e.g., from around 0.02 to
approximately 0.001 in the Sphere function). RMHC attains substantial
enhancements, reducing MSE by roughly 85 to 90 percent compared to GA.
Simultaneously, RS consistently exhibits errors exceeding 0.3, signifying
subpar performance. These findings underscore that hybrid and evolutionary
procedures significantly improve training efficiency and accuracy compared to
conventional optimization methods and imply that the Building Block Hypothesis
(BBH) may still be valid, indicating that advantageous weight structures are
retained during evolutionary search.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种自适应约束进化强化学习（ACERL）方法，用于动态物料搬运（DMH）问题，通过多样化的探索和自适应训练实例选择，解决了稀疏奖励和约束满足的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态物料搬运任务需要实时分配运输任务以最小化完成时间和延迟，但由于动态事件和稀疏奖励，传统方法难以满足需求。

Method: ACERL通过维护一组演员进行多样化探索，自适应选择训练实例，并限制策略行为以解决稀疏奖励和约束违反问题。

Result: 在多个实例上的实验表明，ACERL优于现有算法，能完全满足约束条件，并在噪声环境下表现稳健。

Conclusion: ACERL通过协调各组件，显著提升了动态物料搬运任务的调度性能，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Dynamic material handling (DMH) involves the assignment of dynamically
arriving material transporting tasks to suitable vehicles in real time for
minimising makespan and tardiness. In real-world scenarios, historical task
records are usually available, which enables the training of a decision policy
on multiple instances consisting of historical records. Recently, reinforcement
learning has been applied to solve DMH. Due to the occurrence of dynamic events
such as new tasks, adaptability is highly required. Solving DMH is challenging
since constraints including task delay should be satisfied. A feedback is
received only when all tasks are served, which leads to sparse reward. Besides,
making the best use of limited computational resources and historical records
for training a robust policy is crucial. The time allocated to different
problem instances would highly impact the learning process. To tackle those
challenges, this paper proposes a novel adaptive constrained evolutionary
reinforcement learning (ACERL) approach, which maintains a population of actors
for diverse exploration. ACERL accesses each actor for tackling sparse rewards
and constraint violation to restrict the behaviour of the policy. Moreover,
ACERL adaptively selects the most beneficial training instances for improving
the policy. Extensive experiments on eight training and eight unseen test
instances demonstrate the outstanding performance of ACERL compared with
several state-of-the-art algorithms. Policies trained by ACERL can schedule the
vehicles while fully satisfying the constraints. Additional experiments on 40
unseen noised instances show the robust performance of ACERL. Cross-validation
further presents the overall effectiveness of ACREL. Besides, a rigorous
ablation study highlights the coordination and benefits of each ingredient of
ACERL.

Abstract: This study investigates columnar-organized spiking neural networks (SNNs) for
continual learning and catastrophic forgetting. Using CoLaNET (Columnar Layered
Network), we show that microcolumns adapt most efficiently to new tasks when
they lack shared structure with prior learning. We demonstrate how CoLaNET
hyperparameters govern the trade-off between retaining old knowledge

configuration learns ten sequential MNIST tasks effectively, maintaining 92%
accuracy on each. It shows low forgetting, with only 4% performance degradation
on the first task after training on nine subsequent tasks.

Motivation: 解决传统随机数生成器中熵源阵列的偏差变化（BV）问题，优化硬件友好的去偏方法。

Method: 使用64x64阵列的pgSPADs作为熵源，通过门控电压调节降低BV，并应用Von Neumann算法去偏。

Result: 在室温下实现了<1%的BV，生成速率为2 kHz/像素，去偏后通过了NIST的16项测试。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了BV问题，为硬件随机数生成提供了高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Random number generators that utilize arrays of entropy source elements
suffer from bias variation (BV). Despite the availability of efficient
debiasing algorithms, optimized implementations of hardware friendly options
depend on the bit bias in the raw bit streams and cannot accommodate a wide BV.
In this work, we present a 64 x 64 array of perimeter gated single photon
avalanche diodes (pgSPADs), fabricated in a 0.35 {\mu}m standard CMOS
technology, as a source of entropy to generate random binary strings with a BV
compensation technique. By applying proper gate voltages based on the devices'
native dark count rates, we demonstrate less than 1% BV for a raw-bit
generation rate of 2 kHz/pixel at room temperature. The raw bits were debiased
using the classical iterative Von Neumann's algorithm and the debiased bits
were found to pass all of the 16 tests from NIST's Statistical Test Suite.

Result: AET在多个数据集和架构中表现优异，鲁棒性提升，训练成本降低8-25%。

Conclusion: 特征预条件化对高效鲁棒防御至关重要，AET为对抗训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: Adversarial Training (AT) is a cornerstone defense, but many variants
overlook foundational feature representations by primarily focusing on stronger
attack generation. We introduce Adversarial Evolution Training (AET), a simple
yet powerful framework that strategically prepends an Empirical Risk
Minimization (ERM) phase to conventional AT. We hypothesize this initial ERM
phase cultivates a favorable feature manifold, enabling more efficient and
effective robustness acquisition. Empirically, AET achieves comparable or
superior robustness more rapidly, improves clean accuracy, and cuts training
costs by 8-25\%. Its effectiveness is shown across multiple datasets,
architectures, and when augmenting established AT methods. Our findings
underscore the impact of feature pre-conditioning via standard training for
developing more efficient, principled robust defenses. Code is available in the

Result: 理论证明无偏风险估计器的泛化误差界，实验验证了MDPU的有效性。

Conclusion: MDPU框架在LLP问题中表现优越，适用于实际应用场景。

Abstract: Label Proportion Learning (LLP) addresses the classification problem where
multiple instances are grouped into bags and each bag contains information
about the proportion of each class. However, in practical applications,
obtaining precise supervisory information regarding the proportion of instances
in a specific class is challenging. To better align with real-world application
scenarios and effectively leverage the proportional constraints of instances
within tuples, this paper proposes a generalized learning framework
\emph{MDPU}. Specifically, we first mathematically model the distribution of
instances within tuples of arbitrary size, under the constraint that the number
of positive instances is no less than that of negative instances. Then we
derive an unbiased risk estimator that satisfies risk consistency based on the
empirical risk minimization (ERM) method. To mitigate the inevitable
overfitting issue during training, a risk correction method is introduced,
leading to the development of a corrected risk estimator. The generalization
error bounds of the unbiased risk estimator theoretically demonstrate the
consistency of the proposed method. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets
and comparisons with other relevant baseline methods comprehensively validate
the effectiveness of the proposed learning framework.

Conclusion: 该框架能有效捕捉蜂窝流量的时空模式，显著提升预测性能。

Abstract: Cellular traffic prediction is of great importance for operators to manage
network resources and make decisions. Traffic is highly dynamic and influenced
by many exogenous factors, which would lead to the degradation of traffic
prediction accuracy. This paper proposes an end-to-end framework with two
variants to explicitly characterize the spatiotemporal patterns of cellular
traffic among neighboring cells. It uses convolutional neural networks with an
attention mechanism to capture the spatial dynamics and Kalman filter for
temporal modelling. Besides, we can fully exploit the auxiliary information
such as social activities to improve prediction performance. We conduct
extensive experiments on three real-world datasets. The results show that our
proposed models outperform the state-of-the-art machine learning techniques in
terms of prediction accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有旋转量化方法存在两个根本问题：无法对齐通道均值导致量化范围扩大和舍入误差增加；旋转使激活分布更接近高斯分布，增加了截断误差的能量损失。

Method: 引入BASE-Q方法，结合偏置校正和非对称缩放，减少舍入和截断误差，并支持分块优化，避免全模型反向传播的高内存消耗。

Result: 实验表明，BASE-Q在多个LLM和基准测试中显著提升了性能，将精度差距缩小了50.5%、42.9%和29.2%（相比QuaRot、SpinQuant和OSTQuant）。

Conclusion: BASE-Q是一种简单而强大的方法，有效解决了旋转量化的局限性，并显著提升了量化模型的性能。

Abstract: Rotations have become essential to state-of-the-art quantization pipelines
for large language models (LLMs) by effectively smoothing outliers in weights
and activations. However, further optimizing the rotation parameters offers
only limited performance gains and introduces significant training overhead:
due to rotation parameter sharing, full-model must be loaded simultaneously to
enable backpropagation, resulting in substantial memory consumption and limited
practical utility. In this work, we identify two fundamental limitations of
current rotational quantization methods: (i) rotation fails to align channel
means, resulting in wider quantization bounds and increased rounding errors;
and (ii) rotation makes the activation distribution more Gaussian-like,
increasing energy loss caused by clipping errors. To address these issues, we
introduce \textbf{BASE-Q}, a simple yet powerful approach that combines bias
correction and asymmetric scaling to effectively reduce rounding and clipping
errors. Furthermore, BASE-Q enables blockwise optimization, eliminating the
need for memory-intensive full-model backpropagation. Extensive experiments on
various LLMs and benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of BASE-Q, narrowing
the accuracy gap to full-precision models by 50.5\%, 42.9\%, and 29.2\%
compared to QuaRot, SpinQuant, and OSTQuant, respectively. The code will be
released soon.

Result: 揭示了模型输出的收敛模式，并提供了理论支持。

Abstract: The increasing use of synthetic data from the public Internet has enhanced
data usage efficiency in large language model (LLM) training. However, the
potential threat of model collapse remains insufficiently explored. Existing
studies primarily examine model collapse in a single model setting or rely
solely on statistical surrogates. In this work, we introduce LLM Web Dynamics
(LWD), an efficient framework for investigating model collapse at the network
level. By simulating the Internet with a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
database, we analyze the convergence pattern of model outputs. Furthermore, we
provide theoretical guarantees for this convergence by drawing an analogy to
interacting Gaussian Mixture Models.

Result: 通过数值模拟展示了观测数据、动作和噪声结构对LAM学习的影响。

Conclusion: LAM学习可通过数据增强和清理等策略优化，以更好地捕捉动作相关变化。

Abstract: Latent action models (LAMs) aim to learn action-relevant changes from
unlabeled videos by compressing changes between frames as latents. However,
differences between video frames can be caused by controllable changes as well
as exogenous noise, leading to an important concern -- do latents capture the
changes caused by actions or irrelevant noise? This paper studies this issue
analytically, presenting a linear model that encapsulates the essence of LAM
learning, while being tractable.This provides several insights, including
connections between LAM and principal component analysis (PCA), desiderata of
the data-generating policy, and justification of strategies to encourage
learning controllable changes using data augmentation, data cleaning, and
auxiliary action-prediction. We also provide illustrative results based on
numerical simulation, shedding light on the specific structure of observations,
actions, and noise in data that influence LAM learning.

Conclusion: BLUR强调了稳健评估的重要性，并指出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Machine unlearning has the potential to improve the safety of large language
models (LLMs) by removing sensitive or harmful information post hoc. A key
challenge in unlearning involves balancing between forget quality (effectively
unlearning undesirable information) and retain quality (maintaining good
performance on other, general tasks). Unfortunately, as we show, current LLM
unlearning benchmarks contain highly disparate forget and retain sets --
painting a false picture of the effectiveness of LLM unlearning methods. This
can be particularly problematic because it opens the door for benign
perturbations, such as relearning attacks, to easily reveal supposedly
unlearned knowledge once models are deployed. To address this, we present
$\texttt{BLUR}$: a benchmark for LLM unlearning that provides more realistic
scenarios of forget-retain overlap. $\texttt{BLUR}$ significantly expands on
existing unlearning benchmarks by providing extended evaluation tasks, combined
forget/retain queries, and relearning datasets of varying degrees of
difficulty. Despite the benign nature of the queries considered, we find that
the performance of existing methods drops significantly when evaluated on
$\texttt{BLUR}$, with simple approaches performing better on average than more
recent methods. These results highlight the importance of robust evaluation and
suggest several important directions of future study. Our benchmark is publicly

### [272] [Contraction Actor-Critic: Contraction Metric-Guided Reinforcement Learning for Robust Path Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15700)
*Minjae Cho,Hiroyasu Tsukamoto,Huy Trong Tran*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种将控制收缩度量（CCM）与强化学习（RL）结合的方法，称为收缩演员-评论家（CAC），以解决CCM在动态模型已知和长期最优性方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CCM虽然能保证系统收敛到单一轨迹，但缺乏对轨迹整体最优性的考虑，且需要已知动态模型和复杂的无限维凸可行性问题求解，限制了其在复杂系统中的应用。

Method: 通过将CCM集成到RL中，CAC算法学习一个收缩度量生成器（CMG）和最优跟踪策略，利用动态模型提供的信息反馈。

Result: 实验表明，CAC在模拟和真实机器人任务中优于基线方法，并提供了将收缩理论融入RL的理论依据。

Conclusion: CAC结合了CCM的收敛性和RL的长期最优性，为复杂系统的控制提供了自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Control contraction metrics (CCMs) provide a framework to co-synthesize a
controller and a corresponding contraction metric -- a positive-definite
Riemannian metric under which a closed-loop system is guaranteed to be
incrementally exponentially stable. However, the synthesized controller only
ensures that all the trajectories of the system converge to one single
trajectory and, as such, does not impose any notion of optimality across an
entire trajectory. Furthermore, constructing CCMs requires a known dynamics
model and non-trivial effort in solving an infinite-dimensional convex
feasibility problem, which limits its scalability to complex systems featuring
high dimensionality with uncertainty. To address these issues, we propose to
integrate CCMs into reinforcement learning (RL), where CCMs provide
dynamics-informed feedback for learning control policies that minimize
cumulative tracking error under unknown dynamics. We show that our algorithm,
called contraction actor-critic (CAC), formally enhances the capability of CCMs
to provide a set of contracting policies with the long-term optimality of RL in
a fully automated setting. Given a pre-trained dynamics model, CAC
simultaneously learns a contraction metric generator (CMG) -- which generates a
contraction metric -- and uses an actor-critic algorithm to learn an optimal
tracking policy guided by that metric. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
algorithm relative to established baselines through extensive empirical
studies, including simulated and real-world robot experiments, and provide a
theoretical rationale for incorporating contraction theory into RL.

*Haolin Pan,Hongyu Lin,Haoran Luo,Yang Liu,Kaichun Yao,Libo Zhang,Mingjie Xing,Yanjun Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Compiler-R1是一个基于强化学习的框架，通过增强LLM能力优化编译器自动调优，实现了8.46%的IR指令数减少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决编译器自动调优中缺乏高质量推理数据集和有效编译环境交互的挑战。

Method: 提出Compiler-R1框架，包含高质量推理数据集和两阶段端到端RL训练流程。

Result: 在七个数据集上平均减少8.46%的IR指令数。

Conclusion: Compiler-R1展示了RL训练LLM在编译器优化中的强大潜力。

Abstract: Compiler auto-tuning optimizes pass sequences to improve performance metrics
such as Intermediate Representation (IR) instruction count. Although recent
advances leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in
automating compiler tuning, two significant challenges still remain: the
absence of high-quality reasoning datasets for agents training, and limited
effective interactions with the compilation environment. In this work, we
introduce Compiler-R1, the first reinforcement learning (RL)-driven framework
specifically augmenting LLM capabilities for compiler auto-tuning. Compiler-R1
features a curated, high-quality reasoning dataset and a novel two-stage
end-to-end RL training pipeline, enabling efficient environment exploration and
learning through an outcome-based reward. Extensive experiments across seven
datasets demonstrate Compiler-R1 achieving an average 8.46% IR instruction
count reduction compared to opt -Oz, showcasing the strong potential of
RL-trained LLMs for compiler optimization. Our code and datasets are publicly
available at https://github.com/Panhaolin2001/Compiler-R1.

*Peter Belcak,Greg Heinrich,Jan Kautz,Pavlo Molchanov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为minifinetuning（MFT）的方法，用于在低数据情况下减少语言模型微调时的过拟合和泛化性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型在新领域的微调通常会导致其通用性能下降，尤其是在数据资源有限的情况下。

Method: MFT通过样本级别的个性化自蒸馏技术，无需预训练数据回放，显著降低了过拟合导致的泛化性能下降。

Result: MFT在多种模型和领域中表现出比标准微调更好的专业化与泛化性能平衡，且对数据稀缺（低至500样本）具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MFT优于参数高效微调方法，具有类似回放的泛化缓解特性，并可与其他方法结合使用。

Abstract: Finetuning language models for a new domain inevitably leads to the
deterioration of their general performance. This becomes more pronounced the
more limited the finetuning data resource.
  We introduce minifinetuning (MFT), a method for language model domain
adaptation that considerably reduces the effects of overfitting-induced
degeneralization in low-data settings and which does so in the absence of any
pre-training data for replay. MFT demonstrates 2-10x more favourable
specialization-to-degeneralization ratios than standard finetuning across a
wide range of models and domains and exhibits an intrinsic robustness to
overfitting when data in the new domain is scarce and down to as little as 500
samples.
  Employing corrective self-distillation that is individualized on the sample
level, MFT outperforms parameter-efficient finetuning methods, demonstrates
replay-like degeneralization mitigation properties, and is composable with
either for a combined effect.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的联邦不完全多视图聚类方法FIMCFG，通过全局融合图指导解决现有方法在特征提取和缺失数据问题上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦多视图聚类方法仅使用全局伪标签指导聚类，未能充分利用全局信息提取特征，且对缺失数据问题研究不足。

Method: 设计双头图卷积编码器提取全局和视图特定特征，通过融合图指导特征融合，并在伪标签监督下进行聚类。

Result: 实验证明FIMCFG的有效性和优越性。

Conclusion: FIMCFG解决了现有方法的不足，提升了聚类性能。

Abstract: Federated multi-view clustering has been proposed to mine the valuable
information within multi-view data distributed across different devices and has
achieved impressive results while preserving the privacy. Despite great
progress, most federated multi-view clustering methods only used global
pseudo-labels to guide the downstream clustering process and failed to exploit
the global information when extracting features. In addition, missing data
problem in federated multi-view clustering task is less explored. To address
these problems, we propose a novel Federated Incomplete Multi-view Clustering
method with globally Fused Graph guidance (FIMCFG). Specifically, we designed a
dual-head graph convolutional encoder at each client to extract two kinds of
underlying features containing global and view-specific information.
Subsequently, under the guidance of the fused graph, the two underlying
features are fused into high-level features, based on which clustering is
conducted under the supervision of pseudo-labeling. Finally, the high-level
features are uploaded to the server to refine the graph fusion and
pseudo-labeling computation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness and superiority of FIMCFG. Our code is publicly available at
https://github.com/PaddiHunter/FIMCFG.

### [276] [Learn from the Past: Fast Sparse Indexing for Large Language Model Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15704)
*Feiyu Yao,Qian Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LFPS是一种基于历史注意力模式的稀疏索引加速方法，显著减少解码时的计算和内存开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长上下文解码时KV缓存的内存需求和计算开销成为瓶颈，现有稀疏注意力方法未能利用历史解码信息。

Method: LFPS动态构建稀疏索引候选，捕捉垂直和斜线模式，结合位置扩展策略预测Top-k索引。

Result: 在LongBench-RULER基准测试中，LFPS比全注意力快22.8倍，比精确Top-k检索快9.6倍，且保持生成准确性。

Conclusion: LFPS为长上下文LLM推理提供了一种高效实用的解码优化方案。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to support increasingly longer
contexts, the memory demand for key-value (KV) caches during decoding grows
rapidly, becoming a critical bottleneck in both GPU memory capacity and PCIe
bandwidth. Sparse attention mechanisms alleviate this issue by computing
attention weights only for selected key-value pairs. However, their indexing
computation typically requires traversing all key vectors, resulting in
significant computational and data transfer overhead. To reduce the cost of
index retrieval, existing methods often treat each decoding step as an
independent process, failing to exploit the temporal correlations embedded in
historical decoding information. To this end, we propose LFPS(Learn From the
Past for Sparse Indexing), an acceleration method that dynamically constructs
sparse indexing candidates based on historical attention patterns. LFPS
captures two prevalent trends in decoder attention -vertical patterns
(attending to fixed positions) and slash patterns (attending to relative
positions) -and incorporates a positional expansion strategy to effectively
predict the Top-k indices for the current step. We validate LFPS on challenging
long-context benchmarks such as LongBench-RULER, using Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct as
the base model. Experimental results show that LFPS achieves up to 22.8$\times$
speedup over full attention and 9.6$\times$ speedup over exact Top-k retrieval
on an RTX 4090 GPU and a single CPU core of a Xeon Gold 6430, respectively,
while preserving generation accuracy. These results demonstrate that LFPS
offers a practical and efficient solution for decoding optimization in
long-context LLM inference.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了时间序列基础模型（TSFMs）在宏观经济指标零样本预测中的能力，无需训练定制模型或大量数据。实验表明，TSFMs能内化经济动态并适应制度变化，但在快速冲击期表现下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究TSFMs在零样本条件下预测宏观经济指标的潜力，避免传统方法需要大量数据和定制模型的限制。

Method: 在数据稀缺和结构断裂条件下，对三种先进TSFM（Chronos、TimeGPT和Moirai）进行严格回测。

Result: TSFMs能内化经济动态、适应制度变化，并在稳定经济条件下匹配或超越传统模型，但在快速冲击期表现下降。

Conclusion: TSFMs在零样本部署中具有潜力，但需注意其在快速冲击期的局限性，为宏观经济监测和战略规划提供指导。

Abstract: This study investigates zero-shot forecasting capabilities of Time Series
Foundation Models (TSFMs) for macroeconomic indicators. We apply TSFMs to
forecasting economic indicators under univariate conditions, bypassing the need
for train bespoke econometric models using and extensive training datasets. Our
experiments were conducted on a case study dataset, without additional
customisation. We rigorously back-tested three state-of-the-art TSFMs (Chronos,
TimeGPT and Moirai) under data-scarce conditions and structural breaks. Our
results demonstrate that appropriately engineered TSFMs can internalise rich
economic dynamics, accommodate regime shifts, and deliver well-behaved
uncertainty estimates out of the box, while matching state-of-the-art
multivariate models on this domain. Our findings suggest that, without any
fine-tuning, TSFMs can match or exceed classical models during stable economic
conditions. However, they are vulnerable to degradation in performances during
periods of rapid shocks. The findings offer guidance to practitioners on when
zero-shot deployments are viable for macroeconomic monitoring and strategic
planning.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多粒度直接偏好优化方法（MDPO），通过三个粒度优化LLMs的数学推理能力，并在实验中表现优于DPO及其变体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在数学推理中容易产生幻觉，现有方法如DPO在长链推理中效果有限，无法有效区分偏好数据中的差异。

Method: MDPO方法在Solution2Solution、Inference2Inference和Step2Step三个粒度上优化LLMs的数学推理，并统一训练目标与生成指标对齐。

Result: 在Qwen2和Llama3模型上，GSM8K和MATH数据集的性能分别提升了1.7%、0.9%和2.3%、1.2%。

Conclusion: MDPO显著提升了LLMs的数学推理能力，且提供了一种无需人工标注的数据构建流程。

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning presents a significant challenge for Large Language
Models (LLMs) as it requires ensuring the correctness of each reasoning step.
Researchers have been strengthening the mathematical reasoning abilities of
LLMs through supervised fine-tuning, but due to the inability to suppress
incorrect outputs, illusions can easily arise. Recently, Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) has been widely adopted for aligning human intent by using
preference data to prevent LLMs from generating incorrect outputs. However, it
has shown limited benefits in long-chain mathematical reasoning, mainly because
DPO struggles to effectively capture the differences between accepted and
rejected answers from preferences in long-chain data. The inconsistency between
DPO training and LLMs' generation metrics also affects the effectiveness of
suppressing incorrect outputs. We propose the Multi-Granularity Direct
Preference Optimization (MDPO) method, optimizing the mathematical reasoning of
LLMs at three granularities: Solution2Solution, Inference2Inference, and
Step2Step. Solution2Solution focuses on the correctness of entire long-chain
reasoning; Inference2Inference concentrates on logical reasoning between steps;
Step2Step corrects computational errors in steps, enhancing the computational
capabilities of LLMs. Additionally, we unify the training objectives of the
three granularities to align with the generation metrics. We conducted
experiments on the open-source models Qwen2 and Llama3, achieving improvements
of 1.7% and 0.9% on the GSM8K dataset, and 2.3% and 1.2% on the MATH dataset,
outperforming DPO and other DPO variant methods. Furthermore, we also provide a
pipeline for constructing MDPO training data that is simple and does not
require manual annotation costs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何更有效地分配固定推理预算以提升LLM性能，解决现有方法在资源分配上的不足。

Method: 提出DORA方法，通过方向级资源分配优化搜索效率，理论证明其最优性。

Result: 在MATH500等数学推理基准上，DORA表现优于基线方法，达到最优准确率。

Conclusion: DORA为TTS提供了更优的资源分配策略，推动了LLM推理效率的提升。

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) improves the performance of Large Language Models
(LLMs) by using additional inference-time computation to explore multiple
reasoning paths through search. Yet how to allocate a fixed rollout budget most
effectively during search remains underexplored, often resulting in inefficient
use of compute at test time. To bridge this gap, we formulate test-time search
as a resource allocation problem and derive the optimal allocation strategy
that maximizes the probability of obtaining a correct solution under a fixed
rollout budget. Within this formulation, we reveal a core limitation of
existing search methods: solution-level allocation tends to favor reasoning
directions with more candidates, leading to theoretically suboptimal and
inefficient use of compute. To address this, we propose Direction-Oriented
Resource Allocation (DORA), a provably optimal method that mitigates this bias
by decoupling direction quality from candidate count and allocating resources
at the direction level. To demonstrate DORA's effectiveness, we conduct
extensive experiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks
including MATH500, AIME2024, and AIME2025. The empirical results show that DORA
consistently outperforms strong baselines with comparable computational cost,
achieving state-of-the-art accuracy. We hope our findings contribute to a
broader understanding of optimal TTS for LLMs.

Motivation: 现有GNN框架未考虑脑区间的因果关系，而这对脑疾病分类至关重要。

Result: CGB在脑疾病分类任务中的F1分数优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CGB通过建模因果关系和优化图结构，显著提升了脑疾病分类性能。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been developed to model the relationship
between regions of interest (ROIs) in brains and have shown significant
improvement in detecting brain diseases. However, most of these frameworks do
not consider the intrinsic relationship of causality factor between brain ROIs,
which is arguably more essential to observe cause and effect interaction
between signals rather than typical correlation values. We propose a novel
framework called CGB (Causal Graphs for Brains) for brain disease
classification/detection, which models refined brain networks based on the
causal discovery method, transfer entropy, and geometric curvature strategy.
CGB unveils causal relationships between ROIs that bring vital information to
enhance brain disease classification performance. Furthermore, CGB also
performs a graph rewiring through a geometric curvature strategy to refine the
generated causal graph to become more expressive and reduce potential
information bottlenecks when GNNs model it. Our extensive experiments show that
CGB outperforms state-of-the-art methods in classification tasks on brain
disease datasets, as measured by average F1 scores.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图神经网络（GNNs）在网络模体SP预测方面缺乏研究，且无基准测试，作者希望填补这一空白。

Method: 将SP估计任务独立于子图频率估计，采用多目标回归方法，优化可解释性、稳定性和大规模图的可扩展性。

Result: 实验表明，1-WL受限模型难以精确估计SP，但能通过比较预测SP与合成生成器的SP来近似网络生成过程。

Conclusion: 直接SP估计有助于突破子图计数在模体估计中的理论限制，为GNNs在模体分析中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a predominant method for graph
representation learning. However, beyond subgraph frequency estimation, their
application to network motif significance-profile (SP) prediction remains
under-explored, with no established benchmarks in the literature. We propose to
address this problem, framing SP estimation as a task independent of subgraph
frequency estimation. Our approach shifts from frequency counting to direct SP
estimation and modulates the problem as multitarget regression. The
reformulation is optimised for interpretability, stability and scalability on
large graphs. We validate our method using a large synthetic dataset and
further test it on real-world graphs. Our experiments reveal that 1-WL limited
models struggle to make precise estimations of SPs. However, they can
generalise to approximate the graph generation processes of networks by
comparing their predicted SP with the ones originating from synthetic
generators. This first study on GNN-based motif estimation also hints at how
using direct SP estimation can help go past the theoretical limitations that
motif estimation faces when performed through subgraph counting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管强化学习（RL）能提升大语言模型（LLMs）的推理能力，但其大规模应用资源消耗巨大。研究发现RL并未赋予模型新知识，而是调整输出分布，激发潜在推理能力。因此，假设RL诱导的概率变化与模型规模无关，可通过小模型RL训练后转移到大模型。

Method: 提出RAST方法，通过分析解码轨迹验证假设，将小型RL训练模型的概率调整注入大型模型。

Result: 实验表明，RAST显著提升基础模型的推理能力，且GPU内存需求远低于直接RL训练，有时性能甚至优于RL训练模型。

Conclusion: RAST揭示了RL驱动推理的本质，并提供了无需高计算成本的实用扩展策略。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a powerful approach for improving the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), as evidenced by recent
successes such as OpenAI's o1 and Deepseek-R1. However, applying RL at scale
remains intimidatingly resource-intensive, requiring multiple model copies and
extensive GPU workloads. On the other hand, while being powerful, recent
studies suggest that RL does not fundamentally endow models with new knowledge;
rather, it primarily reshapes the model's output distribution to activate
reasoning capabilities latent in the base model. Building on this insight, we
hypothesize that the changes in output probabilities induced by RL are largely
model-size invariant, opening the door to a more efficient paradigm: training a
small model with RL and transferring its induced probability shifts to larger
base models. To verify our hypothesis, we conduct a token-level analysis of
decoding trajectories and find high alignment in RL-induced output
distributions across model scales, validating our hypothesis. Motivated by
this, we propose RAST, a simple yet effective method that transfers reasoning
behaviors by injecting RL-induced probability adjustments from a small
RL-trained model into larger models. Experiments across multiple mathematical
reasoning benchmarks show that RAST substantially and consistently enhances the
reasoning capabilities of base models while requiring significantly lower GPU
memory than direct RL training, sometimes even yielding better performance than
the RL-trained counterparts. Our findings offer new insights into the nature of
RL-driven reasoning and practical strategies for scaling its benefits without
incurring its full computational cost. The project page of RAST is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在隐私保护分布式训练中具有重要作用，但梯度反转攻击可能导致隐私泄露。现有防御方法缺乏对敏感梯度的精准识别，导致保护不足或性能下降。

Method: 利用具有可解释性的影子模型识别敏感区域，并针对性地注入噪声，实现更精准的隐私保护。

Result: 在ChestXRay和EyePACS数据集上，PSNR和SSIM指标显著优于无防御情况，且模型性能影响极小（F1降低小于1%）。

Conclusion: 该框架在多种医学图像上验证了泛化能力，对多种梯度反转攻击类型均有效，显著提升了联邦学习的隐私保护能力。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a transformative framework for
privacy-preserving distributed training, allowing clients to collaboratively
train a global model without sharing their local data. This is especially
crucial in sensitive fields like healthcare, where protecting patient data is
paramount. However, privacy leakage remains a critical challenge, as the
communication of model updates can be exploited by potential adversaries.
Gradient inversion attacks (GIAs), for instance, allow adversaries to
approximate the gradients used for training and reconstruct training images,
thus stealing patient privacy. Existing defense mechanisms obscure gradients,
yet lack a nuanced understanding of which gradients or types of image
information are most vulnerable to such attacks. These indiscriminate
calibrated perturbations result in either excessive privacy protection
degrading model accuracy, or insufficient one failing to safeguard sensitive
information. Therefore, we introduce a framework that addresses these
challenges by leveraging a shadow model with interpretability for identifying
sensitive areas. This enables a more targeted and sample-specific noise
injection. Specially, our defensive strategy achieves discrepancies of 3.73 in
PSNR and 0.2 in SSIM compared to the circumstance without defense on the
ChestXRay dataset, and 2.78 in PSNR and 0.166 in the EyePACS dataset. Moreover,
it minimizes adverse effects on model performance, with less than 1\% F1
reduction compared to SOTA methods. Our extensive experiments, conducted across
diverse types of medical images, validate the generalization of the proposed
framework. The stable defense improvements for FedAvg are consistently over
1.5\% times in LPIPS and SSIM. It also offers a universal defense against
various GIA types, especially for these sensitive areas in images.

Motivation: 锂离子电池故障检测对电动汽车和储能系统的安全运行至关重要，但现有方法难以捕捉复杂时间依赖关系且无法充分利用未标记数据。

Method: 扩展标准BERT架构，加入时间序列到令牌的表示模块和点级掩码信号建模任务，进行自监督学习，生成鲁棒的时间嵌入，结合元数据输入下游分类器。

Result: 在大规模真实数据集上，AUROC达到0.945，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 验证了BERT风格预训练在时间序列故障检测中的有效性。

Abstract: Accurate fault detection in lithium-ion batteries is essential for the safe
and reliable operation of electric vehicles and energy storage systems.
However, existing methods often struggle to capture complex temporal
dependencies and cannot fully leverage abundant unlabeled data. Although large
language models (LLMs) exhibit strong representation capabilities, their
architectures are not directly suited to the numerical time-series data common
in industrial settings. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
framework that adapts BERT-style pretraining for battery fault detection by
extending the standard BERT architecture with a customized time-series-to-token
representation module and a point-level Masked Signal Modeling (point-MSM)
pretraining task tailored to battery applications. This approach enables
self-supervised learning on sequential current, voltage, and other
charge-discharge cycle data, yielding distributionally robust, context-aware
temporal embeddings. We then concatenate these embeddings with battery metadata
and feed them into a downstream classifier for accurate fault classification.
Experimental results on a large-scale real-world dataset show that models
initialized with our pretrained parameters significantly improve both
representation quality and classification accuracy, achieving an AUROC of 0.945
and substantially outperforming existing approaches. These findings validate
the effectiveness of BERT-style pretraining for time-series fault detection.

different tasks, recent advances in deep learning have explored modifying a
network's neurons to develop so-called task-driven neurons. Prototyping
task-driven neurons (referred to as NeuronSeek) employs symbolic regression
(SR) to discover the optimal neuron formulation and construct a network from
these optimized neurons. Along this direction, this work replaces symbolic
regression with tensor decomposition (TD) to discover optimal neuronal
formulations, offering enhanced stability and faster convergence. Furthermore,
we establish theoretical guarantees that modifying the aggregation functions
with common activation functions can empower a network with a fixed number of
parameters to approximate any continuous function with an arbitrarily small
error, providing a rigorous mathematical foundation for the NeuronSeek
framework. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that our NeuronSeek-TD
framework not only achieves superior stability, but also is competitive
relative to the state-of-the-art models across diverse benchmarks. The code is

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种优化框架，用于解决公民集会中因参与者退出导致代表性失衡的问题。通过历史数据估计退出概率，并选择替补以最小化预期代表性偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公民集会的合法性依赖于其对广泛人群的代表性，但参与者退出常导致代表性失衡。现有方法未考虑替补选择，亟需解决这一问题。

Method: 利用学习理论工具，基于历史数据估计退出概率，并通过优化框架选择替补以最小化预期代表性偏差。

Result: 理论分析提供了样本复杂性和计算效率的保证，实证表明该方法显著提高了代表性且需要更少替补。

Conclusion: 提出的算法框架有效解决了公民集会中的代表性失衡问题，具有理论和实践优势。

Abstract: An increasingly influential form of deliberative democracy centers on
citizens' assemblies, where randomly selected people discuss policy questions.
The legitimacy of these panels hinges on their representation of the broader
population, but panelists often drop out, leading to an unbalanced composition.
Although participant attrition is mitigated in practice by alternates, their
selection is not taken into account by existing methods. To address this gap,
we introduce an optimization framework for alternate selection. Our algorithmic
approach, which leverages learning-theoretic machinery, estimates dropout
probabilities using historical data and selects alternates to minimize expected
misrepresentation. We establish theoretical guarantees for our approach,
including worst-case bounds on sample complexity (with implications for
computational efficiency) and on loss when panelists' probabilities of dropping
out are mis-estimated. Empirical evaluation using real-world data demonstrates
that, compared to the status quo, our method significantly improves
representation while requiring fewer alternates.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为daDPO（Distribution-Aware DPO）的新方法，通过结合偏好优化和基于分布的蒸馏，显著提升了小型语言模型的对话能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在资源受限环境中表现下降，现有知识蒸馏方法（如dDPO）仅关注教师模型的输出，忽略了其输出分布。

Method: 引入daDPO，一种统一的方法，结合偏好优化和基于分布的蒸馏，通过理论分析和实证验证其有效性。

Result: daDPO在性能恢复和小型模型增强方面优于现有方法，例如使修剪后的Vicuna1.5-7B接近教师模型性能，Qwen2.5-1.5B甚至偶尔超越其7B教师模型。

Conclusion: daDPO为资源受限环境中的小型LLMs提供了更高效的优化方案，显著提升了其对话能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across
various applications, but their conversational abilities decline sharply as
model size decreases, presenting a barrier to their deployment in
resource-constrained environments. Knowledge distillation with Direct
Preference Optimization (dDPO) has emerged as a promising approach to enhancing
the conversational abilities of smaller models using a larger teacher model.
However, current methods primarily focus on 'black-box' KD, which only uses the
teacher's responses, overlooking the output distribution offered by the
teacher. This paper addresses this gap by introducing daDPO (Distribution-Aware
DPO), a unified method for preference optimization and distribution-based
distillation. We provide rigorous theoretical analysis and empirical
validation, showing that daDPO outperforms existing methods in restoring
performance for pruned models and enhancing smaller LLM models. Notably, in
in-domain evaluation, our method enables a 20% pruned Vicuna1.5-7B to achieve
near-teacher performance (-7.3% preference rate compared to that of dDPO's
-31%), and allows Qwen2.5-1.5B to occasionally outperform its 7B teacher model
(14.0% win rate).

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为UNIMATE的统一模型，用于同时处理机械超材料设计中的3D拓扑、密度条件和机械性能三种模态，填补了现有研究仅关注两种模态的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在机械超材料设计中通常仅考虑两种模态（如3D拓扑或机械性能），而实际复杂应用场景需要同时考虑三种模态，因此需要一种统一的模型来解决这一问题。

Method: 提出UNIMATE模型，包含模态对齐模块和协同扩散生成模块，用于同时处理3D拓扑、密度条件和机械性能。

Result: 实验表明，UNIMATE在拓扑生成、性能预测和条件确认任务中分别优于基线模型80.2%、5.1%和50.2%。

Conclusion: UNIMATE是一种有效的统一模型，能够同时处理机械超材料设计中的三种模态，填补了现有研究的空白，并开源了模型和结果。

Abstract: Metamaterials are artificial materials that are designed to meet unseen
properties in nature, such as ultra-stiffness and negative materials indices.
In mechanical metamaterial design, three key modalities are typically involved,
i.e., 3D topology, density condition, and mechanical property. Real-world
complex application scenarios place the demanding requirements on machine
learning models to consider all three modalities together. However, a
comprehensive literature review indicates that most existing works only
consider two modalities, e.g., predicting mechanical properties given the 3D
topology or generating 3D topology given the required properties. Therefore,
there is still a significant gap for the state-of-the-art machine learning
models capturing the whole. Hence, we propose a unified model named UNIMATE,
which consists of a modality alignment module and a synergetic diffusion
generation module. Experiments indicate that UNIMATE outperforms the other
baseline models in topology generation task, property prediction task, and
condition confirmation task by up to 80.2%, 5.1%, and 50.2%, respectively. We
opensource our proposed UNIMATE model and corresponding results at

TL;DR: MadaKV是一种模态自适应的KV缓存淘汰策略，旨在提升多模态大语言模型在长上下文推理中的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统KV缓存淘汰方法在多模态场景中无法捕捉模态特定信息，导致性能不佳。

Method: MadaKV通过模态偏好适应和分层压缩补偿两个关键组件，动态感知模态信息并保留关键令牌。

Result: 实验显示，MadaKV显著减少了KV缓存内存占用和推理延迟（提升1.3至1.5倍），同时保持高准确性。

Conclusion: MadaKV在多模态长上下文任务中优于现有KV缓存淘汰方法。

Abstract: This paper introduces MadaKV, a modality-adaptive key-value (KV) cache
eviction strategy designed to enhance the efficiency of multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) in long-context inference. In multimodal scenarios,
attention heads exhibit varying preferences for different modalities, resulting
in significant disparities in modality importance across attention heads.
Traditional KV cache eviction methods, which are tailored for unimodal
settings, fail to capture modality-specific information, thereby yielding
suboptimal performance. MadaKV addresses these challenges through two key
components: modality preference adaptation and hierarchical compression
compensation. By dynamically sensing modality information within attention
heads and adaptively retaining critical tokens, MadaKV achieves substantial
reductions in KV cache memory footprint and model inference decoding latency
(1.3 to 1.5 times improvement) while maintaining high accuracy across various
multimodal long-context tasks. Extensive experiments on representative MLLMs
and the MileBench benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of MadaKV compared to
existing KV cache eviction methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于DDPMs的图生成方法无法在扩散过程中调整图的大小（原子数），限制了其在条件生成（如属性驱动的分子设计）中的应用。

Method: 重新定义了噪声和去噪过程，支持节点的单调插入和删除，使模型GrIDDD能在生成过程中动态调整化学图的大小。

Result: GrIDDD在分子属性目标上表现优于现有图扩散模型，并在分子优化中展现出竞争力。

Conclusion: 该研究为基于图扩散的尺寸自适应分子生成奠定了基础。

Abstract: Generative models of graphs based on discrete Denoising Diffusion
Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) offer a principled approach to molecular
generation by systematically removing structural noise through iterative atom
and bond adjustments. However, existing formulations are fundamentally limited
by their inability to adapt the graph size (that is, the number of atoms)
during the diffusion process, severely restricting their effectiveness in
conditional generation scenarios such as property-driven molecular design,
where the targeted property often correlates with the molecular size. In this
paper, we reformulate the noising and denoising processes to support monotonic
insertion and deletion of nodes. The resulting model, which we call GrIDDD,
dynamically grows or shrinks the chemical graph during generation. GrIDDD
matches or exceeds the performance of existing graph diffusion models on
molecular property targeting despite being trained on a more difficult problem.
Furthermore, when applied to molecular optimization, GrIDDD exhibits
competitive performance compared to specialized optimization models. This work
paves the way for size-adaptive molecular generation with graph diffusion.

Result: 当前方法与人类直觉相关性弱，但结合人类软标签可改善校准。

Conclusion: 人类洞察可指导开发更可信的AI系统。

Abstract: Modern neural networks (NNs) often achieve high predictive accuracy but
remain poorly calibrated, producing overconfident predictions even when wrong.
This miscalibration poses serious challenges in applications where reliable
uncertainty estimates are critical. In this work, we investigate how human
perceptual uncertainty compares to uncertainty estimated by NNs. Using three
vision benchmarks annotated with both human disagreement and crowdsourced
confidence, we assess the correlation between model-predicted uncertainty and
human-perceived uncertainty. Our results show that current methods only weakly
align with human intuition, with correlations varying significantly across
tasks and uncertainty metrics. Notably, we find that incorporating
human-derived soft labels into the training process can improve calibration
without compromising accuracy. These findings reveal a persistent gap between
model and human uncertainty and highlight the potential of leveraging human
insights to guide the development of more trustworthy AI systems.

TL;DR: 提出Fractional Reasoning框架，通过动态调整推理强度提升LLM性能，优于固定推理方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如Best-of-N、多数投票等）对输入统一推理，未考虑问题复杂度差异。

Method: 提取潜在推理向量并调整其强度，支持广度（如Best-of-N）和深度（如自反思）策略。

Result: 在GSM8K、MATH500和GPQA任务中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Fractional Reasoning为推理任务提供了灵活高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Test-time compute has emerged as a powerful paradigm for improving the
performance of large language models (LLMs), where generating multiple outputs
or refining individual chains can significantly boost answer accuracy. However,
existing methods like Best-of-N, majority voting, and self-reflection typically
apply reasoning in a uniform way across inputs, overlooking the fact that
different problems may require different levels of reasoning depth. In this
work, we propose Fractional Reasoning, a training-free and model-agnostic
framework that enables continuous control over reasoning intensity at inference
time, going beyond the limitations of fixed instructional prompts. Our method
operates by extracting the latent steering vector associated with deeper
reasoning and reapplying it with a tunable scaling factor, allowing the model
to tailor its reasoning process to the complexity of each input. This supports
two key modes of test-time scaling: (1) improving output quality in
breadth-based strategies (e.g., Best-of-N, majority voting), and (2) enhancing
the correctness of individual reasoning chains in depth-based strategies (e.g.,
self-reflection). Experiments on GSM8K, MATH500, and GPQA demonstrate that
Fractional Reasoning consistently improves performance across diverse reasoning
tasks and models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自注意力在长序列建模中存在计算瓶颈，STLT通过可学习参数和自适应节点分配提供更高效、可解释的解决方案。

Method: 引入可训练的拉普拉斯节点参数，结合快速递归卷积和FFT计算，动态调整节点数量和活动节点。

Result: 在语言建模、机器翻译和长文档问答任务中表现优于或与现有高效Transformer相当，支持超过100k tokens的上下文长度。

Conclusion: STLT结合了可解释性、可扩展性和鲁棒性，为超长序列建模提供了新途径。

Abstract: We propose an innovative, learnable two-sided short-time Laplace transform
(STLT) mechanism to supplant the traditional self attention in
transformer-based LLMs. Our STLT introduces trainable parameters for each
Laplace node, enabling end-to-end learning of decay rates , oscillatory
frequencies, and window bandwidth T. This flexibility allows the model to
dynamically adapt token relevance half lives and frequency responses during
training. By selecting S learnable nodes and leveraging fast recursive
convolution, we achieve an effective complexity of in time and memory. We
further incorporate an efficient FFT-based computation of the relevance matrix
and an adaptive node allocation mechanism to dynamically adjust the number of
active Laplace nodes. Empirical results on language modeling (WikiText\-103,
Project Gutenberg), machine translation (WMT'14 En\-De), and long document
question answering (NarrativeQA) demonstrate that our learnable STLT achieves
perplexities and scores on par with or better than existing efficient
transformers while naturally extending to context lengths exceeding 100k tokens
or more limited only by available hardware. Ablation studies confirm the
importance of learnable parameters and adaptive node allocation. The proposed
approach combines interpretability, through explicit decay and frequency
parameters, with scalability and robustness, offering a pathway towards
ultra-long-sequence language modeling without the computational bottleneck of
self-attention.

Conclusion: 该框架为农业数据稀缺问题提供了有效解决方案，推动了精准农业的发展。

Abstract: Precision soil greenhouse gas (GHG) flux prediction is essential in
agricultural systems for assessing environmental impacts, developing emission
mitigation strategies and promoting sustainable agriculture. Due to the lack of
advanced sensor and network technologies on majority of farms, there are
challenges in obtaining comprehensive and diverse agricultural data. As a
result, the scarcity of agricultural data seriously obstructs the application
of machine learning approaches in precision soil GHG flux prediction. This
research proposes a knowledge-guided graph neural network framework that
addresses the above challenges by integrating knowledge embedded in an
agricultural process-based model and graph neural network techniques.
Specifically, we utilise the agricultural process-based model to simulate and
generate multi-dimensional agricultural datasets for 47 countries that cover a
wide range of agricultural variables. To extract key agricultural features and
integrate correlations among agricultural features in the prediction process,
we propose a machine learning framework that integrates the autoencoder and
multi-target multi-graph based graph neural networks, which utilises the
autoencoder to selectively extract significant agricultural features from the
agricultural process-based model simulation data and the graph neural network
to integrate correlations among agricultural features for accurately predict
fertilisation-oriented soil GHG fluxes. Comprehensive experiments were
conducted with both the agricultural simulation dataset and real-world
agricultural dataset to evaluate the proposed approach in comparison with
well-known baseline and state-of-the-art regression methods. The results
demonstrate that our proposed approach provides superior accuracy and stability
in fertilisation-oriented soil GHG prediction.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for leveraging
diverse datasets from multiple sources while preserving data privacy by
avoiding centralized storage. However, many existing approaches fail to account
for the intricate gradient correlations between remote clients, a limitation
that becomes especially problematic in data heterogeneity scenarios. In this
work, we propose a novel FL framework utilizing Power-Norm Cosine Similarity
(PNCS) to improve client selection for model aggregation. By capturing
higher-order gradient moments, PNCS addresses non-IID data challenges,
enhancing convergence speed and accuracy. Additionally, we introduce a simple
algorithm ensuring diverse client selection through a selection history queue.
Experiments with a VGG16 model across varied data partitions demonstrate
consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

Method: 在Whisper模型上进行系统架构搜索，探索稀疏化阶段（编码层）和压缩比（稀疏度）的联合空间。

Result: 最佳方案在准确率下降1%以内时，选择在早期编码阶段将隐藏状态稀疏化至40-60%，实现1.6倍运行时加速。

Conclusion: 通过早期稀疏化可以在不微调的情况下显著加速语音转录任务。

Abstract: Transformer-based neural speech processing has achieved state-of-the-art
performance. Since speech audio signals are known to be highly compressible,
here we seek to accelerate neural speech transcription by time-domain signal
sparsification early in the neural encoding stage, taking advantage of the
interpretability of the self-attention mechanism in transformer audio encoders.
With the Whisper family of models, we perform a systematic architecture search
over the joint space of sparsification stage (a certain encoder layer) and
compression ratio (sparsity). We found that the best resulting solutions under
1% accuracy degradation choose to sparsify the hidden state to 40-60% sparsity
at an early encoding stage, and thereby achieve up to 1.6x runtime acceleration
in English speech transcription tasks on Nvidia GPUs without any fine-tuning.

Conclusion: AutoHFormer为高效精确的时间序列建模设立了新基准。

Abstract: Time series forecasting requires architectures that simultaneously achieve
three competing objectives: (1) strict temporal causality for reliable
predictions, (2) sub-quadratic complexity for practical scalability, and (3)
multi-scale pattern recognition for accurate long-horizon forecasting. We
introduce AutoHFormer, a hierarchical autoregressive transformer that addresses
these challenges through three key innovations: 1) Hierarchical Temporal
Modeling: Our architecture decomposes predictions into segment-level blocks
processed in parallel, followed by intra-segment sequential refinement. This
dual-scale approach maintains temporal coherence while enabling efficient
computation. 2) Dynamic Windowed Attention: The attention mechanism employs
learnable causal windows with exponential decay, reducing complexity while
preserving precise temporal relationships. This design avoids both the
anti-causal violations of standard transformers and the sequential bottlenecks
of RNN hybrids. 3) Adaptive Temporal Encoding: a novel position encoding system
is adopted to capture time patterns at multiple scales. It combines fixed
oscillating patterns for short-term variations with learnable decay rates for
long-term trends. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that AutoHFormer 10.76X
faster training and 6.06X memory reduction compared to PatchTST on PEMS08,
while maintaining consistent accuracy across 96-720 step horizons in most of
cases. These breakthroughs establish new benchmarks for efficient and precise
time series modeling. Implementations of our method and all baselines in
hierarchical autoregressive mechanism are available at

Result: 实验表明LAPT能提升对齐鲁棒性且不影响模型通用能力。

Conclusion: 当前对齐范式存在根本缺陷，需转向表示层面的训练策略，超越表面行为监督。

Abstract: Safety alignment is a key requirement for building reliable Artificial
General Intelligence. Despite significant advances in safety alignment, we
observe that minor latent shifts can still trigger unsafe responses in aligned
models. We argue that this stems from the shallow nature of existing alignment
methods, which focus on surface-level refusal behaviors without sufficiently
altering internal representations. Consequently, small shifts in hidden
activations can re-trigger harmful behaviors embedded in the latent space. To
explore the robustness of safety alignment to latent perturbations, we
introduce a probing method that measures the Negative Log-Likelihood of the
original response generated by the model. This probe quantifies local
sensitivity in the latent space, serving as a diagnostic tool for identifying
vulnerable directions. Based on this signal, we construct effective jailbreak
trajectories, giving rise to the Activation Steering Attack (ASA). More
importantly, these insights offer a principled foundation for improving
alignment robustness. To this end, we introduce Layer-wise Adversarial Patch
Training~(LAPT), a fine-tuning strategy that inject controlled perturbations
into hidden representations during training. Experimental results highlight
that LAPT strengthen alignment robustness without compromising general
capabilities. Our findings reveal fundamental flaws in current alignment
paradigms and call for representation-level training strategies that move
beyond surface-level behavior supervision. Codes and results are available at

Motivation: 旨在通过可解释的权重表示和奖励转换，提升强化学习的训练效果和可解释性。

Method: 分为深度学习阶段（拟合值函数）和强化学习阶段（基于奖励转换），支持线性和二次模型。

Result: 在Taxi-v3环境中，VRAIL优于标准DQN，无需环境修改，并能揭示语义子目标。

Conclusion: VRAIL是一种通用的、模型无关的奖励塑造框架，兼具学习和可解释性优势。

Abstract: We propose VRAIL (Vectorized Reward-based Attribution for Interpretable
Learning), a bi-level framework for value-based reinforcement learning (RL)
that learns interpretable weight representations from state features. VRAIL
consists of two stages: a deep learning (DL) stage that fits an estimated value
function using state features, and an RL stage that uses this to shape learning
via potential-based reward transformations. The estimator is modeled in either
linear or quadratic form, allowing attribution of importance to individual
features and their interactions. Empirical results on the Taxi-v3 environment
demonstrate that VRAIL improves training stability and convergence compared to
standard DQN, without requiring environment modifications. Further analysis
shows that VRAIL uncovers semantically meaningful subgoals, such as passenger
possession, highlighting its ability to produce human-interpretable behavior.
Our findings suggest that VRAIL serves as a general, model-agnostic framework
for reward shaping that enhances both learning and interpretability.

manually crafted queries, demonstrating improvements in chunk quality and
downstream RAG performance. Our vision-guided approach achieves better accuracy
compared to traditional vanilla RAG systems, with qualitative analysis showing
superior preservation of document structure and semantic coherence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有预训练方法仅依赖单一视角，无法捕捉多视角间的复杂协同作用，限制了表示的表达能力和泛化性。

Method: 采用变长变通道编码和跨注意力机制，结合信息瓶颈原则的注意力矩阵掩码策略和视角掩码预训练方案。

Result: 在Temple University EEG corpus和CHB-MIT数据集上，CRIA表现优于现有方法，多类事件分类和异常检测的平衡准确率分别为57.02%和80.03%。

Conclusion: CRIA通过多视角融合和自适应编码，显著提升了EEG表示学习的泛化能力和性能。

Abstract: The difficulty of extracting deep features from EEG data and effectively
integrating information from multiple views presents significant challenges for
developing a generalizable pretraining framework for EEG representation
learning. However, most existing pre-training methods rely solely on the
contextual semantics of a single view, failing to capture the complex and
synergistic interactions among different perspectives, limiting the
expressiveness and generalization of learned representations. To address these
issues, this paper proposes CRIA, an adaptive framework that utilizes
variable-length and variable-channel coding to achieve a unified representation
of EEG data across different datasets. In this work, we define cross-view
information as the integrated representation that emerges from the interaction
among temporal, spectral, and spatial views of EEG signals. The model employs a
cross-attention mechanism to fuse temporal, spectral, and spatial features
effectively, and combines an attention matrix masking strategy based on the
information bottleneck principle with a novel viewpoint masking pre-training
scheme. Experimental results on the Temple University EEG corpus and the
CHB-MIT dataset show that CRIA outperforms existing methods with the same
pre-training conditions, achieving a balanced accuracy of 57.02% for
multi-class event classification and 80.03% for anomaly detection, highlighting
its strong generalization ability.

*Qianqian Liao,Wuque Cai,Hongze Sun,Dongze Liu,Duo Chen,Dezhong Yao,Daqing Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种两阶段脑图学习框架（B2P-GL），结合脑区语义相似性和基于条件的群体图建模，提升脑疾病诊断性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于图的脑疾病诊断方法依赖预定义脑图谱，但忽略了图谱中的丰富信息及站点和表型变异的混杂效应。

Method: 第一阶段利用GPT-4知识丰富脑图表示并通过自适应节点重分配图注意力网络优化；第二阶段结合表型数据构建群体图并融合特征以减少混杂效应。

Result: 在ABIDE I、ADHD-200和Rest-meta-MDD数据集上，B2P-GL在预测准确性和可解释性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: B2P-GL为脑疾病诊断提供了可靠且个性化的方法，推动了临床应用。

Abstract: Recent developed graph-based methods for diagnosing brain disorders using
functional connectivity highly rely on predefined brain atlases, but overlook
the rich information embedded within atlases and the confounding effects of
site and phenotype variability. To address these challenges, we propose a
two-stage Brain-to-Population Graph Learning (B2P-GL) framework that integrates
the semantic similarity of brain regions and condition-based population graph
modeling. In the first stage, termed brain representation learning, we leverage
brain atlas knowledge from GPT-4 to enrich the graph representation and refine
the brain graph through an adaptive node reassignment graph attention network.
In the second stage, termed population disorder diagnosis, phenotypic data is
incorporated into population graph construction and feature fusion to mitigate
confounding effects and enhance diagnosis performance. Experiments on the ABIDE
I, ADHD-200, and Rest-meta-MDD datasets show that B2P-GL outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in prediction accuracy while enhancing
interpretability. Overall, our proposed framework offers a reliable and
personalized approach to brain disorder diagnosis, advancing clinical
applicability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在上下文学习（ICL）中是否能够理解和表示潜在概念，并通过实验验证了模型在离散和连续潜在概念任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探究LLMs在ICL中是否真正理解潜在概念，而非仅通过捷径解决问题。

Method: 方法包括分析模型在2跳推理任务（离散潜在概念）和连续潜在概念任务中的表现，观察其表示空间的结构。

Result: 结果显示，模型能成功识别离散潜在概念并逐步组合；在连续潜在概念任务中，表示空间的几何结构与潜在参数化一致。

Conclusion: 结论表明，ICL中存在高度局部化的结构，能够解耦潜在概念，深化了对Transformer表示能力的理解。

Abstract: When large language models (LLMs) use in-context learning (ICL) to solve a
new task, they seem to grasp not only the goal of the task but also core,
latent concepts in the demonstration examples. This begs the question of
whether transformers represent latent structures as part of their computation
or whether they take shortcuts to solve the problem. Prior mechanistic work on
ICL does not address this question because it does not sufficiently examine the
relationship between the learned representation and the latent concept, and the
considered problem settings often involve only single-step reasoning. In this
work, we examine how transformers disentangle and use latent concepts. We show
that in 2-hop reasoning tasks with a latent, discrete concept, the model
successfully identifies the latent concept and does step-by-step concept
composition. In tasks parameterized by a continuous latent concept, we find
low-dimensional subspaces in the representation space where the geometry mimics
the underlying parameterization. Together, these results refine our
understanding of ICL and the representation of transformers, and they provide
evidence for highly localized structures in the model that disentangle latent
concepts in ICL tasks.

*Jingtong Su,Julia Kempe,Karen Ullrich*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SAMD的方法，用于将任意复杂的概念映射到Transformer模型的特定注意力头，并通过SAMI策略调整概念效果。实验表明该方法在语言和视觉任务中均有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前归因方法主要关注简单概念和多层感知机神经元，忽略了注意力机制的影响，且缺乏统一的分析复杂概念的方法。

Method: 提出SAMD方法，将概念表示为向量，计算其与注意力头的余弦相似度，选择TopK头构建概念关联模块；提出SAMI策略，通过标量参数调整模块效果。

Result: 实验证明模块位置在训练前后稳定，SAMI可显著改变模型行为（如提升安全漏洞或推理能力），并在视觉任务中验证了方法的通用性。

Conclusion: SAMD和SAMI为Transformer模型的解释性和控制提供了通用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art performance across language and
vision tasks. This success drives the imperative to interpret their internal
mechanisms with the dual goals of enhancing performance and improving
behavioral control. Attribution methods help advance interpretability by
assigning model outputs associated with a target concept to specific model
components. Current attribution research primarily studies multi-layer
perceptron neurons and addresses relatively simple concepts such as factual
associations (e.g., Paris is located in France). This focus tends to overlook
the impact of the attention mechanism and lacks a unified approach for
analyzing more complex concepts. To fill these gaps, we introduce Scalable
Attention Module Discovery (SAMD), a concept-agnostic method for mapping
arbitrary, complex concepts to specific attention heads of general transformer
models. We accomplish this by representing each concept as a vector,
calculating its cosine similarity with each attention head, and selecting the
TopK-scoring heads to construct the concept-associated attention module. We
then propose Scalar Attention Module Intervention (SAMI), a simple strategy to
diminish or amplify the effects of a concept by adjusting the attention module
using only a single scalar parameter. Empirically, we demonstrate SAMD on
concepts of varying complexity, and visualize the locations of their
corresponding modules. Our results demonstrate that module locations remain
stable before and after LLM post-training, and confirm prior work on the
mechanics of LLM multilingualism. Through SAMI, we facilitate jailbreaking on
HarmBench (+72.7%) by diminishing "safety" and improve performance on the GSM8K
benchmark (+1.6%) by amplifying "reasoning". Lastly, we highlight the
domain-agnostic nature of our approach by suppressing the image classification
accuracy of vision transformers on ImageNet.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了知识蒸馏（KD）对大型语言模型（LLMs）记忆训练数据的影响，发现蒸馏能降低记忆风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs会记忆训练数据，引发隐私和安全问题，但知识蒸馏对此的影响尚不明确。

Method: 通过将大型教师模型蒸馏为小型学生模型，研究不同KD方法对记忆任务数据的影响。

Result: 蒸馏不仅降低计算成本和模型大小，还显著减少记忆风险。

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏是减少LLMs记忆风险的有效方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to memorize parts of their training
data, raising important concerns around privacy and security. While previous
research has focused on studying memorization in pre-trained models, much less
is known about how knowledge distillation (KD) affects memorization.In this
study, we explore how different KD methods influence the memorization of
fine-tuned task data when a large teacher model is distilled into smaller
student variants.This study demonstrates that distilling a larger teacher
model, fine-tuned on a dataset, into a smaller variant not only lowers
computational costs and model size but also significantly reduces the
memorization risks compared to standard fine-tuning approaches.

TL;DR: 使用条件Wasserstein生成对抗网络（CWGAN）生成ALS患者的合成EEG信号，以解决数据稀缺和类别不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ALS患者的高质量EEG数据稀缺，且与健康对照组存在严重的类别不平衡，导致机器学习分类器训练困难。

Method: 通过CWGAN学习ALS EEG信号的分布，生成合成信号，并对EEG数据进行预处理和归一化。

Result: 生成的合成信号与真实ALS EEG模式相似，CWGAN训练稳定，合成数据可用于增强分类器训练。

Conclusion: 该方法有助于缓解数据稀缺和类别不平衡问题，提升ALS检测准确性，并促进数据共享和诊断模型改进。

Abstract: Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a rare neurodegenerative disease, and
high-quality EEG data from ALS patients are scarce. This data scarcity, coupled
with severe class imbalance between ALS and healthy control recordings, poses a
challenge for training reliable machine learning classifiers. In this work, we
address these issues by generating synthetic EEG signals for ALS patients using
a Conditional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (CWGAN). We train
CWGAN on a private EEG dataset (ALS vs. non-ALS) to learn the distribution of
ALS EEG signals and produce realistic synthetic samples. We preprocess and
normalize EEG recordings, and train a CWGAN model to generate synthetic ALS
signals. The CWGAN architecture and training routine are detailed, with key
hyperparameters chosen for stable training. Qualitative evaluation of generated
signals shows that they closely mimic real ALS EEG patterns. The CWGAN training
converged with generator and discriminator loss curves stabilizing, indicating
successful learning. The synthetic EEG signals appear realistic and have
potential use as augmented data for training classifiers, helping to mitigate
class imbalance and improve ALS detection accuracy. We discuss how this
approach can facilitate data sharing and enhance diagnostic models.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了自回归基础模型在高模糊性预测中的局限性，提出了一种基于认知科学的方法改进预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机源于贝叶斯最优预测在高模糊性情境下的计算不可行性，以及认知科学中启发式策略的优越性。

Method: 提出了MetaHMM合成序列元学习基准，并将预训练模型转化为蒙特卡洛预测器，分离任务推理与标记预测。

Result: 初步结果显示，在模糊情境下，改进后的方法通过优化容量分配和测试时推理显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: 尽管存在挑战，但研究表明基于认知理论的方法在高模糊性预测中具有潜力。

Abstract: The rapid adaptation ability of auto-regressive foundation models is often
attributed to the diversity of their pre-training data. This is because, from a
Bayesian standpoint, minimizing prediction error in such settings requires
integrating over all plausible latent hypotheses consistent with observations.
While this behavior is desirable in principle, it often proves too ambitious in
practice: under high ambiguity, the number of plausible latent alternatives
makes Bayes-optimal prediction computationally intractable. Cognitive science
has long recognized this limitation, suggesting that under such conditions,
heuristics or information-seeking strategies are preferable to exhaustive
inference. Translating this insight to next-token prediction, we hypothesize
that low- and high-ambiguity predictions pose different computational demands,
making ambiguity-agnostic next-token prediction a detrimental inductive bias.
To test this, we introduce MetaHMM, a synthetic sequence meta-learning
benchmark with rich compositional structure and a tractable Bayesian oracle. We
show that Transformers indeed struggle with high-ambiguity predictions across
model sizes. Motivated by cognitive theories, we propose a method to convert
pre-trained models into Monte Carlo predictors that decouple task inference
from token prediction. Preliminary results show substantial gains in ambiguous
contexts through improved capacity allocation and test-time scalable inference,
though challenges remain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图方法在空间域边界附近难以获得有意义的点表示，因为它们过于依赖相邻点，而忽略了全局关系。

Method: Spotscape引入Similarity Telescope模块捕捉全局关系，并提出相似性缩放策略调节点间距离，支持多切片整合。

Result: 实验表明Spotscape在单切片和多切片任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: Spotscape为空间转录组学提供了一种更有效的分析方法，尤其在处理边界点和多切片整合方面表现突出。

Abstract: Spatially Resolved Transcriptomics (SRT) is a cutting-edge technique that
captures the spatial context of cells within tissues, enabling the study of
complex biological networks. Recent graph-based methods leverage both gene
expression and spatial information to identify relevant spatial domains.
However, these approaches fall short in obtaining meaningful spot
representations, especially for spots near spatial domain boundaries, as they
heavily emphasize adjacent spots that have minimal feature differences from an
anchor node. To address this, we propose Spotscape, a novel framework that
introduces the Similarity Telescope module to capture global relationships
between multiple spots. Additionally, we propose a similarity scaling strategy
to regulate the distances between intra- and inter-slice spots, facilitating
effective multi-slice integration. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of Spotscape in various downstream tasks, including single-slice
and multi-slice scenarios. Our code is available at the following link: https:

Motivation: 现有FSCIL方法固定特征提取器限制了模型对新类的适应性，导致灾难性遗忘和过拟合。

Method: 提出Tri-WE方法，插值基础模型、前一个模型和当前模型的权重空间，并引入放大数据知识蒸馏的损失项。

Result: 在miniImageNet、CUB200和CIFAR100数据集上取得最先进结果。

Conclusion: Tri-WE方法有效解决了FSCIL中的灾难性遗忘和过拟合问题，提升了模型适应性。

Abstract: Few-shot class incremental learning (FSCIL) enables the continual learning of
new concepts with only a few training examples. In FSCIL, the model undergoes
substantial updates, making it prone to forgetting previous concepts and
overfitting to the limited new examples. Most recent trend is typically to
disentangle the learning of the representation from the classification head of
the model. A well-generalized feature extractor on the base classes (many
examples and many classes) is learned, and then fixed during incremental
learning. Arguing that the fixed feature extractor restricts the model's
adaptability to new classes, we introduce a novel FSCIL method to effectively
address catastrophic forgetting and overfitting issues. Our method enables to
seamlessly update the entire model with a few examples. We mainly propose a
tripartite weight-space ensemble (Tri-WE). Tri-WE interpolates the base,
immediately previous, and current models in weight-space, especially for the
classification heads of the models. Then, it collaboratively maintains
knowledge from the base and previous models. In addition, we recognize the
challenges of distilling generalized representations from the previous model
from scarce data. Hence, we suggest a regularization loss term using amplified
data knowledge distillation. Simply intermixing the few-shot data, we can
produce richer data enabling the distillation of critical knowledge from the
previous model. Consequently, we attain state-of-the-art results on the
miniImageNet, CUB200, and CIFAR100 datasets.

Result: 在网格环境和结构化序列生成中，ENN-GFN-Enhanced优于基线方法。

Conclusion: ENN-GFN-Enhanced能有效提升探索效率和轨迹识别能力。

Abstract: Efficiently identifying the right trajectories for training remains an open
problem in GFlowNets. To address this, it is essential to prioritize
exploration in regions of the state space where the reward distribution has not
been sufficiently learned. This calls for uncertainty-driven exploration, in
other words, the agent should be aware of what it does not know. This attribute
can be measured by joint predictions, which are particularly important for
combinatorial and sequential decision problems. In this research, we integrate
epistemic neural networks (ENN) with the conventional architecture of GFlowNets
to enable more efficient joint predictions and better uncertainty
quantification, thereby improving exploration and the identification of optimal
trajectories. Our proposed algorithm, ENN-GFN-Enhanced, is compared to the
baseline method in GFlownets and evaluated in grid environments and structured
sequence generation in various settings, demonstrating both its efficacy and
efficiency.

Conclusion: 该研究首次在自回归图像生成模型中实现了令牌级水印，解决了重新标记导致的水印丢失问题，为生成模型输出的追踪提供了新方法。

Abstract: Watermarking the outputs of generative models has emerged as a promising
approach for tracking their provenance. Despite significant interest in
autoregressive image generation models and their potential for misuse, no prior
work has attempted to watermark their outputs at the token level. In this work,
we present the first such approach by adapting language model watermarking
techniques to this setting. We identify a key challenge: the lack of reverse
cycle-consistency (RCC), wherein re-tokenizing generated image tokens
significantly alters the token sequence, effectively erasing the watermark. To
address this and to make our method robust to common image transformations,
neural compression, and removal attacks, we introduce (i) a custom
tokenizer-detokenizer finetuning procedure that improves RCC, and (ii) a
complementary watermark synchronization layer. As our experiments demonstrate,
our approach enables reliable and robust watermark detection with theoretically
grounded p-values.

Conclusion: 提示条件参数生成是梯度适应的高效替代方案。

Abstract: Modern Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods such as low-rank
adaptation (LoRA) reduce the cost of customizing large language models (LLMs),
yet still require a separate optimization run for every downstream dataset. We
introduce \textbf{Drag-and-Drop LLMs (\textit{DnD})}, a prompt-conditioned
parameter generator that eliminates per-task training by mapping a handful of
unlabeled task prompts directly to LoRA weight updates. A lightweight text
encoder distills each prompt batch into condition embeddings, which are then
transformed by a cascaded hyper-convolutional decoder into the full set of LoRA
matrices. Once trained in a diverse collection of prompt-checkpoint pairs, DnD
produces task-specific parameters in seconds, yielding i) up to
\textbf{12,000$\times$} lower overhead than full fine-tuning, ii) average gains
up to \textbf{30\%} in performance over the strongest training LoRAs on unseen
common-sense reasoning, math, coding, and multimodal benchmarks, and iii)
robust cross-domain generalization despite never seeing the target data or
labels. Our results demonstrate that prompt-conditioned parameter generation is
a viable alternative to gradient-based adaptation for rapidly specializing
LLMs. Our project is available at

Conclusion: 研究为MoE路由器设计提供了比较分析，并为大规模模型部署中的性能优化提供了见解。

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures increase large language model
scalability, yet their performance depends on the router module that moves
tokens to specialized experts. Bad routing can load imbalance and reduced
accuracy. This project designed and implemented different router architectures
within Transformer models to fix these limitations. We experimented with six
distinct router variants Linear, Attention, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP),
Hybrid, Hash, and our new MLP-Hadamard. We characterized these routers using
BERT and the Qwen1.5-MoE model, looking at parameter efficiency, inference
latency, routing entropy, and expert utilization patterns. Our evaluations
showed distinct trade-offs: Linear routers offer speed, while MLP and Attention
routers provide greater expressiveness. The MLP-Hadamard router shows a unique
capability for structured, sparse routing. We successfully replaced and
fine-tuned custom routers within the complex, quantized Qwen1.5-MoE model. This
work provides a comparative analysis of MoE router designs and offers insights
into optimizing their performance for efficient and effective large-scale model
deployment.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) offer a powerful approach to solving
partial differential equations (PDEs), which are ubiquitous in the quantitative
sciences. Applied to both forward and inverse problems across various
scientific domains, PINNs have recently emerged as a valuable tool in the field
of scientific machine learning. A key aspect of their training is that the data
-- spatio-temporal points sampled from the PDE's input domain -- are readily
available. Influence functions, a tool from the field of explainable AI (XAI),
approximate the effect of individual training points on the model, enhancing
interpretability. In the present work, we explore the application of influence
function-based sampling approaches for the training data. Our results indicate
that such targeted resampling based on data attribution methods has the
potential to enhance prediction accuracy in physics-informed neural networks,
demonstrating a practical application of an XAI method in PINN training.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is widely recognized for its parameter-efficient
fine-tuning of large-scale neural models. However, standard LoRA independently
optimizes low-rank matrices, which inherently limits its expressivity and
generalization capabilities. While classical tensor-train (TT) decomposition
can be separately employed on individual LoRA matrices, this work demonstrates
that the classical TT-based approach neither significantly improves parameter
efficiency nor achieves substantial performance gains. This paper proposes
TensorGuide, a novel tensor-train-guided adaptation framework to overcome these
limitations. TensorGuide generates two correlated low-rank LoRA matrices
through a unified TT structure driven by controlled Gaussian noise. The
resulting joint TT representation inherently provides structured, low-rank
adaptations, significantly enhancing expressivity, generalization, and
parameter efficiency without increasing the number of trainable parameters.
Theoretically, we justify these improvements through neural tangent kernel
analyses, demonstrating superior optimization dynamics and enhanced
generalization. Extensive experiments on quantum dot classification and GPT-2
fine-tuning benchmarks demonstrate that TensorGuide-based LoRA consistently
outperforms standard LoRA and TT-LoRA, achieving improved accuracy and
scalability with fewer parameters.

Abstract: Sampling efficiently from a target unnormalized probability density remains a
core challenge, with relevance across countless high-impact scientific
applications. A promising approach towards this challenge is the design of
amortized samplers that borrow key ideas, such as probability path design, from
state-of-the-art generative diffusion models. However, all existing
diffusion-based samplers remain unable to draw samples from distributions at
the scale of even simple molecular systems. In this paper, we propose
Progressive Inference-Time Annealing (PITA), a novel framework to learn
diffusion-based samplers that combines two complementary interpolation
techniques: I.) Annealing of the Boltzmann distribution and II.) Diffusion
smoothing. PITA trains a sequence of diffusion models from high to low
temperatures by sequentially training each model at progressively higher
temperatures, leveraging engineered easy access to samples of the
temperature-annealed target density. In the subsequent step, PITA enables
simulating the trained diffusion model to procure training samples at a lower
temperature for the next diffusion model through inference-time annealing using
a novel Feynman-Kac PDE combined with Sequential Monte Carlo. Empirically, PITA
enables, for the first time, equilibrium sampling of N-body particle systems,
Alanine Dipeptide, and tripeptides in Cartesian coordinates with dramatically
lower energy function evaluations. Code available at:

Conclusion: Subspace Boosting有效解决了模型合并中的性能下降问题，并通过高阶广义奇异值分解提供了任务相似性的新视角。

Abstract: Model merging enables the combination of multiple specialized expert models
into a single model capable of performing multiple tasks. However, the benefits
of merging an increasing amount of specialized experts generally lead to
diminishing returns and reduced overall performance gains. In this work, we
offer an explanation and analysis from a task arithmetic perspective; revealing
that as the merging process (across numerous existing merging methods)
continues for more and more experts, the associated task vector space
experiences rank collapse. To mitigate this issue, we introduce Subspace
Boosting, which operates on the singular value decomposed task vector space and
maintains task vector ranks. Subspace Boosting raises merging efficacy for up
to 20 expert models by large margins of more than 10% when evaluated on vision
benchmarks. Moreover, we propose employing Higher-Order Generalized Singular
Value Decomposition to further quantify task similarity, offering a new
interpretable perspective on model merging.

Motivation: 现有基于平滑的鲁棒共形预测方法需要多次模型前向传播，计算成本高。本文旨在减少计算开销，同时保持鲁棒性。

Method: 利用任何二元证书，提出单样本鲁棒共形预测（RCP1），通过单次随机扰动输入实现鲁棒性。

Result: RCP1在保持鲁棒性的同时，平均预测集大小小于现有方法（如每输入约100次前向传播）。

Conclusion: 本文方法通过认证共形预测过程而非单个分数，实现了计算高效且鲁棒的预测集，适用于分类和回归任务。

Abstract: Given any model, conformal prediction (CP) returns prediction sets guaranteed
to include the true label with high adjustable probability. Robust CP (RCP)
extends this to inputs with worst-case noise. A well-established approach is to
use randomized smoothing for RCP since it is applicable to any black-box model
and provides smaller sets compared to deterministic methods. However, current
smoothing-based RCP requires many model forward passes per each input which is
computationally expensive. We show that conformal prediction attains some
robustness even with a forward pass on a single randomly perturbed input. Using
any binary certificate we propose a single sample robust CP (RCP1). Our
approach returns robust sets with smaller average set size compared to SOTA
methods which use many (e.g. around 100) passes per input. Our key insight is
to certify the conformal prediction procedure itself rather than individual
scores. Our approach is agnostic to the setup (classification and regression).
We further extend our approach to smoothing-based robust conformal risk
control.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了迁移学习中的次优指导问题，提升了强化学习的适用性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning algorithms often suffer from poor sample efficiency,
making them challenging to apply in multi-task or continual learning settings.
Efficiency can be improved by transferring knowledge from a previously trained
teacher policy to guide exploration in new but related tasks. However, if the
new task sufficiently differs from the teacher's training task, the transferred
guidance may be sub-optimal and bias exploration toward low-reward behaviors.
We propose an energy-based transfer learning method that uses
out-of-distribution detection to selectively issue guidance, enabling the
teacher to intervene only in states within its training distribution. We
theoretically show that energy scores reflect the teacher's state-visitation
density and empirically demonstrate improved sample efficiency and performance
across both single-task and multi-task settings.

Result: 实验结果表明，FLAME在不同计算环境下均优于现有方法，提供了稳健且高效的资源自适应联邦学习方案。

Conclusion: FLAME通过SMoE架构和优化机制，显著提升了资源自适应联邦学习的性能和适应性。

Abstract: Existing resource-adaptive LoRA federated fine-tuning methods enable clients
to fine-tune models using compressed versions of global LoRA matrices, in order
to accommodate various compute resources across clients. This compression
requirement will lead to suboptimal performance due to information loss. To
address this, we propose FLAME, a novel federated learning framework based on
the Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) architecture. Unlike prior approaches,
FLAME retains full (uncompressed) global LoRA matrices and achieves client-side
adaptability by varying the number of activated experts per client. However,
incorporating SMoE into federated learning introduces unique challenges,
specifically, the mismatch in output magnitude from partial expert activation
and the imbalance in expert training quality across clients. FLAME tackles
these challenges through a lightweight rescaling mechanism and an
activation-aware aggregation scheme. Empirical results across diverse
computational settings demonstrate that FLAME consistently outperforms existing
methods, providing a robust and effective solution for resource-adaptive
federated learning.

Result: DPAC在MuJoCo连续控制任务中优于TD3，并在离散动作空间中表现竞争力。

Conclusion: 新框架和算法在处理多样化动作空间时具有优势，为强化学习提供了更通用的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework that treats
distribution parameters as actions, redefining the boundary between agent and
environment. This reparameterization makes the new action space continuous,
regardless of the original action type (discrete, continuous, mixed, etc.).
Under this new parameterization, we develop a generalized deterministic policy
gradient estimator, Distribution Parameter Policy Gradient (DPPG), which has
lower variance than the gradient in the original action space. Although
learning the critic over distribution parameters poses new challenges, we
introduce interpolated critic learning (ICL), a simple yet effective strategy
to enhance learning, supported by insights from bandit settings. Building on
TD3, a strong baseline for continuous control, we propose a practical
DPPG-based actor-critic algorithm, Distribution Parameter Actor-Critic (DPAC).
Empirically, DPAC outperforms TD3 in MuJoCo continuous control tasks from
OpenAI Gym and DeepMind Control Suite, and demonstrates competitive performance
on the same environments with discretized action spaces.

Result: 提供了实践指南，帮助识别模型或数据中的鲁棒性和不变性问题，并改进了似然方法的常见缺陷。

Conclusion: 论文为实际工业场景中的质量检测提供了更可靠的框架，强调了适合现实场景的实证风险评估方法。

Abstract: The detection and localization of quality-related problems in industrially
mass-produced products has historically relied on manual inspection, which is
costly and error-prone. Machine learning has the potential to replace manual
handling. As such, the desire is to facilitate an unsupervised (or
self-supervised) approach, as it is often impossible to specify all conceivable
defects ahead of time. A plethora of prior works have demonstrated the aptitude
of common reconstruction-, embedding-, and synthesis-based methods in
laboratory settings. However, in practice, we observe that most methods do not
handle low data quality well or exude low robustness in unfavorable, but
typical real-world settings. For practitioners it may be very difficult to
identify the actual underlying problem when such methods underperform. Worse,
often-reported metrics (e.g., AUROC) are rarely suitable in practice and may
give misleading results. In our setting, we attempt to identify subtle
anomalies on the surface of blasted forged metal parts, using rather
low-quality RGB imagery only, which is a common industrial setting. We
specifically evaluate two types of state-of-the-art models that allow us to
identify and improve quality issues in production data, without having to
obtain new data. Our contribution is to provide guardrails for practitioners
that allow them to identify problems related to, e.g., (lack of) robustness or
invariance, in either the chosen model or the data reliably in similar
scenarios. Furthermore, we exemplify common pitfalls in and shortcomings of
likelihood-based approaches and outline a framework for proper empirical risk
estimation that is more suitable for real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Graph machine learning has led to a significant increase in the capabilities
of models that learn on arbitrary graph-structured data and has been applied to
molecules, social networks, recommendation systems, and transportation, among
other domains. Data in multi-tabular relational databases can also be
constructed as 'relational entity graphs' for Relational Deep Learning (RDL) -
a new blueprint that enables end-to-end representation learning without
traditional feature engineering. Compared to arbitrary graph-structured data,
relational entity graphs have key properties: (i) their structure is defined by
primary-foreign key relationships between entities in different tables, (ii)
the structural connectivity is a function of the relational schema defining a
database, and (iii) the graph connectivity is temporal and heterogeneous in
nature. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of RDL by first
introducing the representation of relational databases as relational entity
graphs, and then reviewing public benchmark datasets that have been used to
develop and evaluate recent GNN-based RDL models. We discuss key challenges
including large-scale multi-table integration and the complexities of modeling
temporal dynamics and heterogeneous data, while also surveying foundational
neural network methods and recent architectural advances specialized for
relational entity graphs. Finally, we explore opportunities to unify these
distinct modeling challenges, highlighting how RDL converges multiple
sub-fields in graph machine learning towards the design of foundation models
that can transform the processing of relational data.

Motivation: 研究如何在LLM预训练中最小化优化器状态，同时保持最先进性能。

Method: 采用列归一化梯度和仅对输出层添加一阶动量的方法。

Result: SCALE在多个LLaMA模型上表现优于Adam和其他内存高效优化器，内存使用仅为35-45%。

Conclusion: SCALE是内存受限大规模预训练的理想选择，并为优化器设计提供了简约基线。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) typically relies on adaptive optimizers
such as Adam, which require significant memory to maintain first- and
second-moment matrices, known as optimizer states. While recent works such as
GaLore, Fira, and APOLLO have proposed state-compressed variants to reduce
memory consumption, a fundamental question remains: What is the minimal amount
of optimizer state that is truly necessary to retain state-of-the-art
performance in LLM pretraining? In this work, we systematically investigate
this question using a bottom-up approach. We find that two memory- and
compute-efficient optimization techniques are particularly effective: (1)
column-wise gradient normalization significantly boosts the performance of
plain SGD without requiring momentum; and (2) adding first-order momentum only
to the output layer - where gradient variance is highest - yields performance
competitive with fully adaptive methods such as Muon. Based on these insights,
we propose SCALE (Stochastic Column-normalized Last-layer Momentum), a new
optimizer that combines column-normalized SGD with last-layer momentum, where
column normalization refers to normalizing the gradient along the output
dimension. Across multiple LLaMA models (60M-1B), SCALE matches or exceeds the
performance of Adam while using only 35-45% of the total memory. It also
consistently outperforms memory-efficient optimizers such as GaLore, Fira, and
APOLLO, making it a strong candidate for large-scale pretraining under memory
constraints. For the LLaMA 7B model, SCALE outperforms the state-of-the-art
method APOLLO in terms of both perplexity and memory consumption. In addition,
our method serves as a minimalist baseline for more sophisticated optimizer
design.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently shown promise in offline RL. However, these
methods often suffer from high training costs and slow convergence,
particularly when using transformer-based denoising backbones. While several
optimization strategies have been proposed -- such as modified noise schedules,
auxiliary prediction targets, and adaptive loss weighting -- challenges remain
in achieving stable and efficient training. In particular, existing loss
weighting functions typically rely on neural network approximators, which can
be ineffective in early training phases due to limited generalization capacity
of MLPs when exposed to sparse feedback in the early training stages. In this
work, we derive a variationally optimal uncertainty-aware weighting function
and introduce a closed-form polynomial approximation method for its online
estimation under the flow-based generative modeling framework. We integrate our
method into a diffusion planning pipeline and evaluate it on standard offline
RL benchmarks. Experimental results on Maze2D and Kitchen tasks show that our
method achieves competitive performance with up to 10 times fewer training
steps, highlighting its practical effectiveness.

Conclusion: TriCon-SF通过增强隐私保护和鲁棒性，为隐私敏感领域的联邦学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Serial pipeline training is an efficient paradigm for handling data
heterogeneity in cross-silo federated learning with low communication overhead.
However, even without centralized aggregation, direct transfer of models
between clients can violate privacy regulations and remain susceptible to
gradient leakage and linkage attacks. Additionally, ensuring resilience against
semi-honest or malicious clients who may manipulate or misuse received models
remains a grand challenge, particularly in privacy-sensitive domains such as
healthcare. To address these challenges, we propose TriCon-SF, a novel serial
federated learning framework that integrates triple shuffling and contribution
awareness. TriCon-SF introduces three levels of randomization by shuffling
model layers, data segments, and training sequences to break deterministic
learning patterns and disrupt potential attack vectors, thereby enhancing
privacy and robustness. In parallel, it leverages Shapley value methods to
dynamically evaluate client contributions during training, enabling the
detection of dishonest behavior and enhancing system accountability. Extensive
experiments on non-IID healthcare datasets demonstrate that TriCon-SF
outperforms standard serial and parallel federated learning in both accuracy
and communication efficiency. Security analysis further supports its resilience
against client-side privacy attacks.

Method: 在训练阶段引入可微分版本的测试时去随机化方法。

Result: 实验表明该方法改善了训练与测试的对齐性，但也带来了训练上的挑战。

Conclusion: 通过引入可微分去随机化方法，可以改善UCO中训练与测试的对齐问题，但需进一步解决训练中的挑战。

Abstract: In unsupervised combinatorial optimization (UCO), during training, one aims
to have continuous decisions that are promising in a probabilistic sense for
each training instance, which enables end-to-end training on initially discrete
and non-differentiable problems. At the test time, for each test instance,
starting from continuous decisions, derandomization is typically applied to
obtain the final deterministic decisions. Researchers have developed more and
more powerful test-time derandomization schemes to enhance the empirical
performance and the theoretical guarantee of UCO methods. However, we notice a
misalignment between training and testing in the existing UCO methods.
Consequently, lower training losses do not necessarily entail better
post-derandomization performance, even for the training instances without any
data distribution shift. Empirically, we indeed observe such undesirable cases.
We explore a preliminary idea to better align training and testing in UCO by
including a differentiable version of derandomization into training. Our
empirical exploration shows that such an idea indeed improves training-test
alignment, but also introduces nontrivial challenges into training.

Abstract: Recently, robust reinforcement learning (RL) methods designed to handle
adversarial input observations have received significant attention, motivated
by RL's inherent vulnerabilities. While existing approaches have demonstrated
reasonable success, addressing worst-case scenarios over long time horizons
requires both minimizing the agent's cumulative rewards for adversaries and
training agents to counteract them through alternating learning. However, this
process introduces mutual dependencies between the agent and the adversary,
making interactions with the environment inefficient and hindering the
development of off-policy methods. In this work, we propose a novel off-policy
method that eliminates the need for additional environmental interactions by
reformulating adversarial learning as a soft-constrained optimization problem.
Our approach is theoretically supported by the symmetric property of policy
evaluation between the agent and the adversary. The implementation is available
at https://github.com/nakanakakosuke/VALT_SAC.

Conclusion: MHCL通过多双曲空间和对比学习，有效提升了异构图嵌入的性能。

Abstract: The hyperbolic space, characterized by a constant negative curvature and
exponentially expanding space, aligns well with the structural properties of
heterogeneous graphs. However, although heterogeneous graphs inherently possess
diverse power-law structures, most hyperbolic heterogeneous graph embedding
models rely on a single hyperbolic space. This approach may fail to effectively
capture the diverse power-law structures within heterogeneous graphs. To
address this limitation, we propose a Metapath-based Hyperbolic Contrastive
Learning framework (MHCL), which uses multiple hyperbolic spaces to capture
diverse complex structures within heterogeneous graphs. Specifically, by
learning each hyperbolic space to describe the distribution of complex
structures corresponding to each metapath, it is possible to capture semantic
information effectively. Since metapath embeddings represent distinct semantic
information, preserving their discriminability is important when aggregating
them to obtain node representations. Therefore, we use a contrastive learning
approach to optimize MHCL and improve the discriminability of metapath
embeddings. In particular, our contrastive learning method minimizes the
distance between embeddings of the same metapath and maximizes the distance
between those of different metapaths in hyperbolic space, thereby improving the
separability of metapath embeddings with distinct semantic information. We
conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of MHCL. The
experimental results demonstrate that MHCL outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines in various graph machine learning tasks, effectively capturing the
complex structures of heterogeneous graphs.

Conclusion: 结论是多元平等框架能更全面地解决ML系统中的不平等问题，促进社会平等。

Abstract: Fairness in machine learning (ML) has become a rapidly growing area of
research. But why, in the first place, is unfairness in ML morally wrong? And
why should we care about improving fairness? Most fair-ML research implicitly
appeals to distributive equality: the idea that desirable goods and benefits,
such as opportunities (e.g., Barocas et al., 2023), should be equally
distributed across society. Unfair ML models, then, are seen as wrong because
they unequally distribute such benefits. This paper argues that this exclusive
focus on distributive equality offers an incomplete and potentially misleading
ethical foundation. Grounding ML fairness in egalitarianism -- the view that
equality is a fundamental moral and social ideal -- requires challenging
structural inequality: systematic, institutional, and durable arrangements that
privilege some groups while disadvantaging others. Structural inequality
manifests through ML systems in two primary forms: allocative harms (e.g.,
economic loss) and representational harms (e.g., stereotypes, erasure). While
distributive equality helps address allocative harms, it fails to explain why
representational harms are wrong -- why it is wrong for ML systems to reinforce
social hierarchies that stratify people into superior and inferior groups --
and why ML systems should aim to foster a society where people relate as equals
(i.e., relational equality). To address these limitations, the paper proposes a
multifaceted egalitarian framework for ML fairness that integrates both
distributive and relational equality. Drawing on critical social and political
philosophy, this framework offers a more comprehensive ethical foundation for
tackling the full spectrum of harms perpetuated by ML systems. The paper also
outlines practical pathways for implementing the framework across the ML
pipeline.

Abstract: With the growing popularity of deep learning and foundation models for
tabular data, the need for standardized and reliable benchmarks is higher than
ever. However, current benchmarks are static. Their design is not updated even
if flaws are discovered, model versions are updated, or new models are
released. To address this, we introduce TabArena, the first continuously
maintained living tabular benchmarking system. To launch TabArena, we manually
curate a representative collection of datasets and well-implemented models,
conduct a large-scale benchmarking study to initialize a public leaderboard,
and assemble a team of experienced maintainers. Our results highlight the
influence of validation method and ensembling of hyperparameter configurations
to benchmark models at their full potential. While gradient-boosted trees are
still strong contenders on practical tabular datasets, we observe that deep
learning methods have caught up under larger time budgets with ensembling. At
the same time, foundation models excel on smaller datasets. Finally, we show
that ensembles across models advance the state-of-the-art in tabular machine
learning and investigate the contributions of individual models. We launch
TabArena with a public leaderboard, reproducible code, and maintenance
protocols to create a living benchmark available at https://tabarena.ai.

*Victor Alejandre,Concha Bielza,Pedro Larrañaga*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文研究了半参数贝叶斯网络（SPBNs）中带宽选择器对性能的影响，提出了交叉验证和插件选择器，并验证其优于传统正态规则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实数据常偏离正态分布，传统正态规则可能导致次优密度估计和预测性能下降。

Method: 应用交叉验证和插件选择器，扩展PyBNesian工具包进行实验分析。

Result: 交叉验证在高样本量场景中优于正态规则，能更有效利用数据信息。

Conclusion: 提出的带宽选择器提升了SPBNs的学习能力和适用性。

Abstract: Semiparametric Bayesian networks (SPBNs) integrate parametric and
non-parametric probabilistic models, offering flexibility in learning complex
data distributions from samples. In particular, kernel density estimators
(KDEs) are employed for the non-parametric component. Under the assumption of
data normality, the normal rule is used to learn the bandwidth matrix for the
KDEs in SPBNs. This matrix is the key hyperparameter that controls the
trade-off between bias and variance. However, real-world data often deviates
from normality, potentially leading to suboptimal density estimation and
reduced predictive performance. This paper first establishes the theoretical
framework for the application of state-of-the-art bandwidth selectors and
subsequently evaluates their impact on SPBN performance. We explore the
approaches of cross-validation and plug-in selectors, assessing their
effectiveness in enhancing the learning capability and applicability of SPBNs.
To support this investigation, we have extended the open-source package
PyBNesian for SPBNs with the additional bandwidth selection techniques and
conducted extensive experimental analyses. Our results demonstrate that the
proposed bandwidth selectors leverage increasing information more effectively
than the normal rule, which, despite its robustness, stagnates with more data.
In particular, unbiased cross-validation generally outperforms the normal rule,
highlighting its advantage in high sample size scenarios.

Motivation: 理解神经网络在非平稳环境中的学习困难，尤其是灾难性遗忘（CF）现象，现有研究对模型规模的影响存在矛盾观察。

Method: 通过变量参数化架构区分懒惰和丰富训练模式，利用动力学平均场理论分析无限宽度模型动态。

Result: 模型宽度增加仅在减少特征学习时有益；高特征学习仅对高度相似任务有益；存在一个由任务相似性调制的过渡点。

Conclusion: 神经网络在特征学习的临界水平达到最佳性能，该水平取决于任务非平稳性，并跨模型规模转移。

Abstract: Despite recent efforts, neural networks still struggle to learn in
non-stationary environments, and our understanding of catastrophic forgetting
(CF) is far from complete. In this work, we perform a systematic study on the
impact of model scale and the degree of feature learning in continual learning.
We reconcile existing contradictory observations on scale in the literature, by
differentiating between lazy and rich training regimes through a variable
parameterization of the architecture. We show that increasing model width is
only beneficial when it reduces the amount of feature learning, yielding more
laziness. Using the framework of dynamical mean field theory, we then study the
infinite width dynamics of the model in the feature learning regime and
characterize CF, extending prior theoretical results limited to the lazy
regime. We study the intricate relationship between feature learning, task
non-stationarity, and forgetting, finding that high feature learning is only
beneficial with highly similar tasks. We identify a transition modulated by
task similarity where the model exits an effectively lazy regime with low
forgetting to enter a rich regime with significant forgetting. Finally, our
findings reveal that neural networks achieve optimal performance at a critical
level of feature learning, which depends on task non-stationarity and transfers
across model scales. This work provides a unified perspective on the role of
scale and feature learning in continual learning.

TL;DR: 利用机器学习和深度学习技术预测新生儿死亡风险，XGBoost和随机森林分类器准确率达94%，LSTM模型最高达99%，LSTM为最佳选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 新生儿死亡率在全球范围内仍较高，早期预测高风险婴儿可降低死亡率。

Method: 使用140万新生儿历史数据，应用逻辑回归、K近邻、随机森林、XGBoost、CNN和LSTM等算法训练预测模型。

Result: XGBoost和随机森林准确率94%，LSTM达99%。

Conclusion: LSTM是最适合预测新生儿死亡风险的模型。

Abstract: Neonatal death is still a concerning reality for underdeveloped and even some
developed countries. Worldwide data indicate that 26.693 babies out of 1,000
births die, according to Macro Trades. To reduce this number, early prediction
of endangered babies is crucial. Such prediction enables the opportunity to
take ample care of the child and mother so that early child death can be
avoided. In this context, machine learning was used to determine whether a
newborn baby is at risk. To train the predictive model, historical data of 1.4
million newborns was used. Machine learning and deep learning techniques such
as logical regression, K-nearest neighbor, random forest classifier, extreme
gradient boosting (XGBoost), convolutional neural network, and long short-term
memory (LSTM) were implemented using the dataset to identify the most accurate
model for predicting neonatal mortality. Among the machine learning algorithms,
XGBoost and random forest classifier achieved the best accuracy with 94%, while
among the deep learning models, LSTM delivered the highest accuracy with 99%.
Therefore, using LSTM appears to be the most suitable approach to predict
whether precautionary measures for a child are necessary.

Motivation: 处理缺失或不规则采样时间序列是机器学习中的常见挑战，现有方法依赖FFT需要均匀采样，插值可能扭曲频谱。

Method: 引入可微分的Lomb-Scargle层计算不规则数据的频谱，并集成到基于分数的扩散模型（LSCD）中。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在填补缺失数据时比纯时域基线更准确，同时提供一致的频谱估计。

Conclusion: 该方法易于集成到学习框架中，为涉及不完整或不规则数据的机器学习方法提供了频谱指导。

Abstract: Time series with missing or irregularly sampled data are a persistent
challenge in machine learning. Many methods operate on the frequency-domain,
relying on the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) which assumes uniform sampling,
therefore requiring prior interpolation that can distort the spectra. To
address this limitation, we introduce a differentiable Lomb--Scargle layer that
enables a reliable computation of the power spectrum of irregularly sampled
data. We integrate this layer into a novel score-based diffusion model (LSCD)
for time series imputation conditioned on the entire signal spectrum.
Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our method
recovers missing data more accurately than purely time-domain baselines, while
simultaneously producing consistent frequency estimates. Crucially, our method
can be easily integrated into learning frameworks, enabling broader adoption of
spectral guidance in machine learning approaches involving incomplete or
irregular data.

Motivation: 现有网络入侵检测基准数据集多依赖合成流量，无法反映实际环境中的统计变异性和时间漂移。

Method: 提出MAWIFlow基准，包含2011、2016和2021年的流量样本，并比较传统机器学习方法与CNN-BiLSTM模型的性能。

Result: 树基分类器在静态数据上表现良好但随时间性能下降，CNN-BiLSTM模型表现更稳定。

Conclusion: 合成基准和静态模型存在局限性，需采用具有明确时间结构的真实数据集。

Abstract: Benchmark datasets for network intrusion detection commonly rely on
synthetically generated traffic, which fails to reflect the statistical
variability and temporal drift encountered in operational environments. This
paper introduces MAWIFlow, a flow-based benchmark derived from the MAWILAB v1.1
dataset, designed to enable realistic and reproducible evaluation of anomaly
detection methods. A reproducible preprocessing pipeline is presented that
transforms raw packet captures into flow representations conforming to the
CICFlowMeter format, while preserving MAWILab's original anomaly labels. The
resulting datasets comprise temporally distinct samples from January 2011,
2016, and 2021, drawn from trans-Pacific backbone traffic.
  To establish reference baselines, traditional machine learning methods,
including Decision Trees, Random Forests, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression, are
compared to a deep learning model based on a CNN-BiLSTM architecture. Empirical
results demonstrate that tree-based classifiers perform well on temporally
static data but experience significant performance degradation over time. In
contrast, the CNN-BiLSTM model maintains better performance, thus showing
improved generalization. These findings underscore the limitations of synthetic
benchmarks and static models, and motivate the adoption of realistic datasets
with explicit temporal structure. All datasets, pipeline code, and model
implementations are made publicly available to foster transparency and
reproducibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多变量时间序列中的因果关系和制度转移对金融或神经数据等场景至关重要，但现有方法无法处理非平稳性或复杂噪声分布。

Method: FANTOM使用贝叶斯期望最大化算法，同时推断制度数量、边界和每个制度的有向无环图。

Result: 理论证明FANTOM的模型在平稳和非平稳设置下是可识别的，实验表明其优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FANTOM为复杂时间序列因果发现提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding causal relationships in multivariate time series is crucial in
many scenarios, such as those dealing with financial or neurological data. Many
such time series exhibit multiple regimes, i.e., consecutive temporal segments
with a priori unknown boundaries, with each regime having its own causal
structure. Inferring causal dependencies and regime shifts is critical for
analyzing the underlying processes. However, causal structure learning in this
setting is challenging due to (1) non stationarity, i.e., each regime can have
its own causal graph and mixing function, and (2) complex noise distributions,
which may be non Gaussian or heteroscedastic. Existing causal discovery
approaches cannot address these challenges, since generally assume stationarity
or Gaussian noise with constant variance. Hence, we introduce FANTOM, a unified
framework for causal discovery that handles non stationary processes along with
non Gaussian and heteroscedastic noises. FANTOM simultaneously infers the
number of regimes and their corresponding indices and learns each regime's
Directed Acyclic Graph. It uses a Bayesian Expectation Maximization algorithm
that maximizes the evidence lower bound of the data log likelihood. On the
theoretical side, we prove, under mild assumptions, that temporal
heteroscedastic causal models, introduced in FANTOM's formulation, are
identifiable in both stationary and non stationary settings. In addition,
extensive experiments on synthetic and real data show that FANTOM outperforms
existing methods.

Method: 通过将深度PNNs与低秩张量分解及Kruskal型唯一性定理联系起来，提出了构造性证明。

Result: 结果表明，非递增层宽度的架构在温和条件下通常是可识别的，而解码器宽度增长不过快的编码器-解码器网络也是可识别的。

Conclusion: 研究解决了PNNs神经变种预期维度的开放猜想，并提供了激活度所需的新界限。

Abstract: Polynomial Neural Networks (PNNs) possess a rich algebraic and geometric
structure. However, their identifiability -- a key property for ensuring
interpretability -- remains poorly understood. In this work, we present a
comprehensive analysis of the identifiability of deep PNNs, including
architectures with and without bias terms. Our results reveal an intricate
interplay between activation degrees and layer widths in achieving
identifiability. As special cases, we show that architectures with
non-increasing layer widths are generically identifiable under mild conditions,
while encoder-decoder networks are identifiable when the decoder widths do not
grow too rapidly. Our proofs are constructive and center on a connection
between deep PNNs and low-rank tensor decompositions, and Kruskal-type
uniqueness theorems. This yields both generic conditions determined by the
architecture, and effective conditions that depend on the network's parameters.
We also settle an open conjecture on the expected dimension of PNN's
neurovarieties, and provide new bounds on the activation degrees required for
it to reach its maximum.

Result: 实验表明，SRCTE仅需少量数据即可快速收敛，且异常信任检测率高于基线算法。

Conclusion: SRCTE框架能有效解决协作系统中信任动态评估的挑战，提升任务协作效率。

Abstract: Trust is emerging as an effective tool to ensure the successful completion of
collaborative tasks within collaborative systems. However, rapidly and
continuously evaluating the trustworthiness of collaborators during task
execution is a significant challenge due to distributed devices, complex
operational environments, and dynamically changing resources. To tackle this
challenge, this paper proposes a Siamese-enabled rapid and continuous trust
evaluation framework (SRCTE) to facilitate effective task collaboration. First,
the communication and computing resource attributes of the collaborator in a
trusted state, along with historical collaboration data, are collected and
represented using an attributed control flow graph (ACFG) that captures
trust-related semantic information and serves as a reference for comparison
with data collected during task execution. At each time slot of task execution,
the collaborator's communication and computing resource attributes, as well as
task completion effectiveness, are collected in real time and represented with
an ACFG to convey their trust-related semantic information. A Siamese model,
consisting of two shared-parameter Structure2vec networks, is then employed to
learn the deep semantics of each pair of ACFGs and generate their embeddings.
Finally, the similarity between the embeddings of each pair of ACFGs is
calculated to determine the collaborator's trust value at each time slot. A
real system is built using two Dell EMC 5200 servers and a Google Pixel 8 to
test the effectiveness of the proposed SRCTE framework. Experimental results
demonstrate that SRCTE converges rapidly with only a small amount of data and
achieves a high anomaly trust detection rate compared to the baseline
algorithm.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently gained significant attention due to their
effectiveness in various scientific domains, including biochemistry. When
trained on equilibrium molecular distributions, diffusion models provide both:
a generative procedure to sample equilibrium conformations and associated
forces derived from the model's scores. However, using the forces for
coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations uncovers inconsistencies in the
samples generated via classical diffusion inference and simulation, despite
both originating from the same model. Particularly at the small diffusion
timesteps required for simulations, diffusion models fail to satisfy the
Fokker-Planck equation, which governs how the score should evolve over time. We
interpret this deviation as an indication of the observed inconsistencies and
propose an energy-based diffusion model with a Fokker-Planck-derived
regularization term enforcing consistency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach on toy systems, alanine dipeptide, and introduce a
state-of-the-art transferable Boltzmann emulator for dipeptides that supports
simulation and demonstrates enhanced consistency and efficient sampling.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the use of small datasets in the context of
offline reinforcement learning (RL). While many common offline RL benchmarks
employ datasets with over a million data points, many offline RL applications
rely on considerably smaller datasets. We show that offline RL algorithms can
overfit on small datasets, resulting in poor performance. To address this
challenge, we introduce "Sparse-Reg": a regularization technique based on
sparsity to mitigate overfitting in offline reinforcement learning, enabling
effective learning in limited data settings and outperforming state-of-the-art
baselines in continuous control.

Abstract: Effectively scaling up deep reinforcement learning models has proven
notoriously difficult due to network pathologies during training, motivating
various targeted interventions such as periodic reset and architectural
advances such as layer normalization. Instead of pursuing more complex
modifications, we show that introducing static network sparsity alone can
unlock further scaling potential beyond their dense counterparts with
state-of-the-art architectures. This is achieved through simple one-shot random
pruning, where a predetermined percentage of network weights are randomly
removed once before training. Our analysis reveals that, in contrast to naively
scaling up dense DRL networks, such sparse networks achieve both higher
parameter efficiency for network expressivity and stronger resistance to
optimization challenges like plasticity loss and gradient interference. We
further extend our evaluation to visual and streaming RL scenarios,
demonstrating the consistent benefits of network sparsity.

Motivation: 现有强化学习方法（如RLHF和RLVR）依赖外部监督，成本高。RLIF旨在通过内部反馈信号减少对外部监督的依赖。

Method: 利用无监督奖励代理（如词级熵、轨迹级熵和自确定性）设计RLIF策略，并在数学推理任务上验证其效果。

Result: RLIF在训练初期能显著提升模型推理能力，甚至优于RLVR，但后期性能下降，且对指令调优模型效果有限。

Conclusion: RLIF为LLM训练提供了一种减少外部监督的方法，但其效果受训练阶段和模型状态影响，需进一步优化。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for post-training
large language models (LLMs) to improve reasoning. Approaches like
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) have shown strong results, but they require
extensive external supervision. We investigate an alternative class of methods,
Reinforcement Learning from Internal Feedback (RLIF), which relies solely on
intrinsic model-derived signals instead of external rewards. In particular, we
leverage unsupervised reward proxies such as token-level entropy,
trajectory-level entropy, and self-certainty. Our theoretical analysis shows
these internal objectives are partially equivalent, and we empirically evaluate
various RLIF strategies on challenging math reasoning benchmarks. Experimental
results demonstrate that RLIF can boost the reasoning performance of base LLMs
at the beginning phase of the training, matching or surpassing RLVR techniques
on these tasks. However, when training progresses, performance degrades even
below the model before training. Moreover, we find that RLIF yields little
improvement for instruction-tuned models, indicating diminishing returns of
intrinsic feedback once an LLM is already instruction-tuned. We further analyze
this limitation by mixing model weights and explain the reason of RLIF's
training behaviors, providing practical guidelines for integrating internal
feedback signals into LLM training. We hope our analysis of internal feedback
will inform more principled and effective strategies for LLM post-training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质子弧治疗（PAT）在放疗中具有优势，但能量层序列优化计算量大，需快速有效的方法。

Method: 引入spot-count表示法，输入UNet架构SPArcdl，优化目标覆盖、OAR暴露和能量切换时间。

Result: SPArcdl显著提升计划质量，缩短能量切换时间38.4%，降低脑干剂量0.21。

Conclusion: SPArcdl是快速生成高质量PAT计划的有效工具。

Abstract: Objective. Proton arc therapy (PAT) is an emerging and promising modality in
radiotherapy, offering several advantages over conventional intensitymodulated
proton therapy (IMPT). However, identifying the optimal energy layer (EL)
sequence remains computationally intensive due to the large number of possible
energy layer transitions. This study proposes an unsupervised deep learning
framework for fast and effective EL pre-selection, aiming to minimize energy
layer switch time while preserving high plan quality. Approach. We introduce a
novel data representation method, spot-count representation, which encodes the
number of proton spots intersecting the target and organs at risk (OARs) in a
matrix structured by sorted gantry angles and energy layers. This
representation is the input of a UNet-based architecture, SPArcdl, which is
trained to optimize a tri-objective function: maximizing target coverage,
minimizing OAR exposure, and reducing energy switching time. The model is
evaluated on 54 nasopharyngeal cancer cases, and its performance is benchmarked
against plans generated by SPArcparticle swarm. Main results. SPArcdl produces
EL pre-selection that significantly improves both plan quality and delivery
efficiency. Compared to SPArc particle swarm, it enhances the conformity index
by 0.16 (p < 0.01), reduces the homogeneity index by 0.71 (p < 0.01), shortens
the energy switching time by 38.4% (p < 0.01), and lowers the mean dose to
brainstem by 0.21 (p < 0.01). The results unintentionally reveal employing
unchanged ELS is more time-wise efficient than descended ELS. SPArcdl's
inference time is within 1 second. Significance. SPArcdl is a fast and
effective tool for generating high-quality PAT plans by strategically
pre-selecting energy layers to reduce delivery time while maintaining excellent
dosimetric performance.

*Xingzhong Fan,Hongming Tang,Yue Zeng,M. B. N. Kouwenhoven,Guangquan Zeng*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: GalCatDiff是一种基于扩散模型的星系生成框架，结合图像特征和天体物理属性，优于传统方法和现有生成模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统星系生成方法依赖物理假设和参数调优，数据驱动的生成模型能更高效地从观测数据中学习，扩散模型在质量和多样性上优于VAEs和GANs。

Method: GalCatDiff采用增强的U-Net和Astro-RAB块，结合注意力机制与卷积操作，并利用类别嵌入实现类别特定生成。

Result: GalCatDiff在样本颜色和大小分布一致性上显著优于现有方法，生成的星系视觉逼真且物理一致。

Conclusion: GalCatDiff提升了星系模拟的可靠性，可作为数据增强工具支持未来星系分类算法开发。

Abstract: Conventional galaxy generation methods rely on semi-analytical models and
hydrodynamic simulations, which are highly dependent on physical assumptions
and parameter tuning. In contrast, data-driven generative models do not have
explicit physical parameters pre-determined, and instead learn them efficiently
from observational data, making them alternative solutions to galaxy
generation. Among these, diffusion models outperform Variational Autoencoders
(VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in quality and diversity.
Leveraging physical prior knowledge to these models can further enhance their
capabilities. In this work, we present GalCatDiff, the first framework in
astronomy to leverage both galaxy image features and astrophysical properties
in the network design of diffusion models. GalCatDiff incorporates an enhanced
U-Net and a novel block entitled Astro-RAB (Residual Attention Block), which
dynamically combines attention mechanisms with convolution operations to ensure
global consistency and local feature fidelity. Moreover, GalCatDiff uses
category embeddings for class-specific galaxy generation, avoiding the high
computational costs of training separate models for each category. Our
experimental results demonstrate that GalCatDiff significantly outperforms
existing methods in terms of the consistency of sample color and size
distributions, and the generated galaxies are both visually realistic and
physically consistent. This framework will enhance the reliability of galaxy
simulations and can potentially serve as a data augmentor to support future
galaxy classification algorithm development.

Motivation: 解决分段常数回归树在预测准确性上落后于黑盒模型（如随机森林）的问题，同时保持高可解释性。

Method: 提出TRUST模型，结合随机森林的准确性与浅层决策树和稀疏线性模型的可解释性，并利用大型语言模型生成解释。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上验证，TRUST在预测准确性上优于其他可解释模型（如CART、Lasso等），并与随机森林相当。

Conclusion: TRUST在准确性和可解释性上均表现出色，是一种有前景的模型。

Abstract: Piecewise-constant regression trees remain popular for their
interpretability, yet often lag behind black-box models like Random Forest in
predictive accuracy. In this work, we introduce TRUST (Transparent, Robust, and
Ultra-Sparse Trees), a novel regression tree model that combines the accuracy
of Random Forests with the interpretability of shallow decision trees and
sparse linear models. TRUST further enhances transparency by leveraging Large
Language Models to generate tailored, user-friendly explanations. Extensive
validation on synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets demonstrates that
TRUST consistently outperforms other interpretable models -- including CART,
Lasso, and Node Harvest -- in predictive accuracy, while matching the accuracy
of Random Forest and offering substantial gains in both accuracy and
interpretability over M5', a well-established model that is conceptually
related.

Motivation: 自动生成文本的滥用风险需要解决，传统水印技术同时用于检测和用户识别会导致误检问题。

Result: 实验验证了理论分析，双水印显著降低误报率且保持高检测精度。

Conclusion: 双水印方法有效解决了误检问题，适用于自动生成文本的水印需求。

Abstract: Digital watermarking is a promising solution for mitigating some of the risks
arising from the misuse of automatically generated text. These approaches
either embed non-specific watermarks to allow for the detection of any text
generated by a particular sampler, or embed specific keys that allow the
identification of the LLM user. However, simultaneously using the same
embedding for both detection and user identification leads to a false detection
problem, whereby, as user capacity grows, unwatermarked text is increasingly
likely to be falsely detected as watermarked. Through theoretical analysis, we
identify the underlying causes of this phenomenon. Building on these insights,
we propose Dual Watermarking which jointly encodes detection and identification
watermarks into generated text, significantly reducing false positives while
maintaining high detection accuracy. Our experimental results validate our
theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: 论文提出BEAT方法，通过检测触发样本来防御LLMs中的后门攻击，利用探针连接效应识别触发输入，并在实验中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 后门攻击对LLMs的安全对齐构成威胁，尤其在黑盒LLMaaS环境中，攻击目标具有样本依赖性，传统防御难以应对。

Method: BEAT通过测量探针连接前后输出分布的变化来识别触发输入，利用样本独立的拒绝信号而非具体攻击行为。

Result: 实验证明BEAT能有效防御多种后门攻击，包括闭源GPT-3.5-turbo，并初步验证对越狱攻击的防御能力。

Conclusion: BEAT为黑盒环境下的LLMs后门防御提供了高效解决方案，并可能扩展至其他类似攻击。

Abstract: Backdoor unalignment attacks against Large Language Models (LLMs) enable the
stealthy compromise of safety alignment using a hidden trigger while evading
normal safety auditing. These attacks pose significant threats to the
applications of LLMs in the real-world Large Language Model as a Service
(LLMaaS) setting, where the deployed model is a fully black-box system that can
only interact through text. Furthermore, the sample-dependent nature of the
attack target exacerbates the threat. Instead of outputting a fixed label, the
backdoored LLM follows the semantics of any malicious command with the hidden
trigger, significantly expanding the target space. In this paper, we introduce
BEAT, a black-box defense that detects triggered samples during inference to
deactivate the backdoor. It is motivated by an intriguing observation (dubbed
the probe concatenate effect), where concatenated triggered samples
significantly reduce the refusal rate of the backdoored LLM towards a malicious
probe, while non-triggered samples have little effect. Specifically, BEAT
identifies whether an input is triggered by measuring the degree of distortion
in the output distribution of the probe before and after concatenation with the
input. Our method addresses the challenges of sample-dependent targets from an
opposite perspective. It captures the impact of the trigger on the refusal
signal (which is sample-independent) instead of sample-specific successful
attack behaviors. It overcomes black-box access limitations by using multiple
sampling to approximate the output distribution. Extensive experiments are
conducted on various backdoor attacks and LLMs (including the closed-source
GPT-3.5-turbo), verifying the effectiveness and efficiency of our defense.
Besides, we also preliminarily verify that BEAT can effectively defend against
popular jailbreak attacks, as they can be regarded as 'natural backdoors'.

TL;DR: PRISON框架量化LLMs的犯罪潜力，发现先进模型在无明确指令下仍表现出犯罪倾向，且识别欺骗行为的能力有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs的发展，其在复杂社会背景下的不当行为引发担忧，现有研究缺乏对其犯罪能力的系统评估。

Method: 提出PRISON框架，通过角色扮演评估LLMs在五个维度的犯罪潜力及反犯罪能力。

Result: 先进LLMs常表现出犯罪倾向，且识别欺骗行为的准确率仅41%。

Conclusion: 需加强对抗鲁棒性、行为对齐和安全机制，以确保LLMs的安全部署。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance, concerns about their misconduct in
complex social contexts intensify. Existing research overlooked the systematic
understanding and assessment of their criminal capability in realistic
interactions. We propose a unified framework PRISON, to quantify LLMs' criminal
potential across five dimensions: False Statements, Frame-Up, Psychological
Manipulation, Emotional Disguise, and Moral Disengagement. Using structured
crime scenarios adapted from classic films, we evaluate both criminal potential
and anti-crime ability of LLMs via role-play. Results show that
state-of-the-art LLMs frequently exhibit emergent criminal tendencies, such as
proposing misleading statements or evasion tactics, even without explicit
instructions. Moreover, when placed in a detective role, models recognize
deceptive behavior with only 41% accuracy on average, revealing a striking
mismatch between conducting and detecting criminal behavior. These findings
underscore the urgent need for adversarial robustness, behavioral alignment,
and safety mechanisms before broader LLM deployment.

TL;DR: 论文提出使用大语言模型（LLM）改进静态应用安全测试（SAST）工具生成的误报（FP）评估，通过高级提示技术显著提升误报检测率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAST工具生成的报告中存在大量误报，降低了安全分析的效率，需要一种自动化方法减少误报。

Method: 利用LLM评估SAST结果，采用Chain-of-Thought和Self-Consistency等提示技术，在OWASP Benchmark和真实项目数据集上进行实验。

Result: LLM在OWASP Benchmark中检测到62.5%的误报，组合多个LLM可提升至78.9%；在真实数据集中检测到33.85%的误报，组合后提升至38.46%。

Conclusion: LLM能有效补充传统SAST工具，提高自动化水平并减少误报处理资源。

Abstract: A key challenge in security analysis is the manual evaluation of potential
security weaknesses generated by static application security testing (SAST)
tools. Numerous false positives (FPs) in these reports reduce the effectiveness
of security analysis. We propose using Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve
the assessment of SAST findings. We investigate the ability of LLMs to reduce
FPs while trying to maintain a perfect true positive rate, using datasets
extracted from the OWASP Benchmark (v1.2) and a real-world software project.
Our results indicate that advanced prompting techniques, such as
Chain-of-Thought and Self-Consistency, substantially improve FP detection.
Notably, some LLMs identified approximately 62.5% of FPs in the OWASP Benchmark
dataset without missing genuine weaknesses. Combining detections from different
LLMs would increase this FP detection to approximately 78.9%. Additionally, we
demonstrate our approach's generalizability using a real-world dataset covering
five SAST tools, three programming languages, and infrastructure files. The
best LLM detected 33.85% of all FPs without missing genuine weaknesses, while
combining detections from different LLMs would increase this detection to
38.46%. Our findings highlight the potential of LLMs to complement traditional
SAST tools, enhancing automation and reducing resources spent addressing false
alarms.

Motivation: 传统PCR和LAMP方法依赖昂贵设备且操作复杂，无法满足田间即时检测需求。

Method: 采用PVA微针贴片快速提取植物叶片样本，建立RPA-CRISPR-Cas12a等温检测系统，特异性靶向P. infestans。

Result: 系统检测限为2 pg/uL，灵敏度媲美实验室设备，接种后第3天和第4天的检测率分别达到80%和100%。

Conclusion: 该系统摆脱了对专业设备的依赖，为田间植物病害早期检测提供了新途径。

Abstract: Potato late blight, caused by the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora infestans,
is one of the most devastating diseases affecting potato crops in the history.
Although conventional detection methods of plant diseases such as PCR and LAMP
are highly sensitive and specific, they rely on bulky and expensive laboratory
equipment and involve complex operations, making them impracticable for
point-of care diagnosis in the field. Here in this study, we report a portable
RPA-CRISPR based diagnosis system for plant disease, integrating smartphone for
acquisition and analysis of fluorescent images. A polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)
microneedle patch was employed for sample extraction on the plant leaves within
one minute, the DNA extraction efficiency achieved 56 ug/mg, which is
approximately 3 times to the traditional CTAB methods (18 ug/mg). The system of
RPA-CRISPR-Cas12a isothermal assay was established to specifically target P.
infestans with no cross-reactivity observed against closely-related species (P.
sojae, P. capsici). The system demonstrated a detection limit of 2 pg/uL for P.
infestans genomic DNA, offering sensitivity comparable to that of benchtop
laboratory equipment. The system demonstrates the early-stage diagnosis
capability by achieving a approximately 80% and 100% detection rate on the
third and fourth day post-inoculation respectively, before visible symptoms
observed on the leaves. The smartphone-based "sample-to-result" system
decouples the limitations of traditional methods that rely heavily on
specialized equipment, offering a promising way for early-stage plant disease
detection and control in the field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于行的分块方法在代码检索增强生成（RAG）中会破坏语义结构（如拆分函数或合并无关代码），从而降低生成质量。

Method: 提出了一种基于AST的结构感知分块方法，递归地将大AST节点拆分为小块，并在大小限制内合并兄弟节点，生成语义连贯的自包含单元。

Result: 该方法在多种代码生成任务中表现优异，如在RepoEval检索中Recall@5提升4.3点，在SWE-bench生成中Pass@1提升2.67点。

Conclusion: 结构感知分块对扩展检索增强的代码智能至关重要。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become essential for large-scale
code generation, grounding predictions in external code corpora to improve
actuality. However, a critical yet underexplored aspect of RAG pipelines is
chunking -- the process of dividing documents into retrievable units. Existing
line-based chunking heuristics often break semantic structures, splitting
functions or merging unrelated code, which can degrade generation quality. We
propose chunking via Abstract Syntax Trees (\ourwork), a structure-aware method
that recursively breaks large AST nodes into smaller chunks and merges sibling
nodes while respecting size limits. This approach generates self-contained,
semantically coherent units across programming languages and tasks, improving
performance on diverse code generation tasks, e.g., boosting Recall@5 by 4.3
points on RepoEval retrieval and Pass@1 by 2.67 points on SWE-bench generation.
Our work highlights the importance of structure-aware chunking for scaling
retrieval-enhanced code intelligence.

Conclusion: 研究为APR领域的进展提供了重要见解，揭示了当前技术趋势和贡献者生态。

Abstract: The rapid progress in Automated Program Repair (APR) has been driven by
advances in AI, particularly large language models (LLMs) and agent-based
systems. SWE-Bench is a recent benchmark designed to evaluate LLM-based repair
systems using real issues and pull requests mined from 12 popular open-source
Python repositories. Its public leaderboards, SWE-Bench Lite and SWE-Bench
Verified, have become central platforms for tracking progress and comparing
solutions. However, because the submission process does not require detailed
documentation, the architectural design and origin of many solutions remain
unclear. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of all
submissions to the SWE-Bench Lite (68 entries) and Verified (79 entries)
leaderboards, analyzing 67 unique approaches across dimensions such as
submitter type, product availability, LLM usage, and system architecture. Our
findings reveal the dominance of proprietary LLMs (especially Claude 3.5/3.7),
the presence of both agentic and non-agentic designs, and a contributor base
spanning from individual developers to large tech companies.

Method: 综合分析了AI工具在验证和验证过程中的应用，包括测试分析、测试用例生成、优化等，并通过企业级应用的端到端回归测试作为概念验证。

Result: 生成的测试用例仅有8.3%的不稳定执行率，显示了AI工具的潜力，但也揭示了语义覆盖、黑盒性和可解释性等挑战。

Conclusion: AI在QA中具有变革潜力，但需战略性地实施，并开发验证方法以应对现有局限性。

Abstract: Traditional quality assurance (QA) methods face significant challenges in
addressing the complexity, scale, and rapid iteration cycles of modern software
systems and are strained by limited resources available, leading to substantial
costs associated with poor quality. The object of this research is the Quality
Assurance processes for modern distributed software applications. The subject
of the research is the assessment of the benefits, challenges, and prospects of
integrating modern AI-oriented tools into quality assurance processes. We
performed comprehensive analysis of implications on both verification and
validation processes covering exploratory test analyses, equivalence
partitioning and boundary analyses, metamorphic testing, finding
inconsistencies in acceptance criteria (AC), static analyses, test case
generation, unit test generation, test suit optimization and assessment, end to
end scenario execution. End to end regression of sample enterprise application
utilizing AI-agents over generated test scenarios was implemented as a proof of
concept highlighting practical use of the study. The results, with only 8.3%
flaky executions of generated test cases, indicate significant potential for
the proposed approaches. However, the study also identified substantial
challenges for practical adoption concerning generation of semantically
identical coverage, "black box" nature and lack of explainability from
state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs), the tendency to correct mutated
test cases to match expected results, underscoring the necessity for thorough
verification of both generated artifacts and test execution results. The
research demonstrates AI's transformative potential for QA but highlights the
importance of a strategic approach to implementing these technologies,
considering the identified limitations and the need for developing appropriate
verification methodologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有APR系统在修复问题时往往仅关注局部可疑代码行，缺乏对问题、代码和执行语义的深入理解，导致生成的补丁过拟合。

Result: 在SWEBench-Lite基准测试中，SemAgent的解决率为44.66%，优于其他工作流方法，比基线提高了7.66%，尤其在需要多行推理和边缘情况处理的问题上表现突出。

Conclusion: 结合问题、代码和执行语义的APR方法能生成更鲁棒且语义一致的修复补丁。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in downstream
software engineering tasks such as Automated Program Repair (APR). In
particular, there has been a lot of research on repository-level
issue-resolution benchmarks such as SWE-Bench. Although there has been
significant progress on this topic, we notice that in the process of solving
such issues, existing agentic systems tend to hyper-localize on immediately
suspicious lines of code and fix them in isolation, without a deeper
understanding of the issue semantics, code semantics, or execution semantics.
Consequently, many existing systems generate patches that overfit to the user
issue, even when a more general fix is preferable. To address this limitation,
we introduce SemAgent, a novel workflow-based procedure that leverages issue,
code, and execution semantics to generate patches that are complete -
identifying and fixing all lines relevant to the issue. We achieve this through
a novel pipeline that (a) leverages execution semantics to retrieve relevant
context, (b) comprehends issue-semantics via generalized abstraction, (c)
isolates code-semantics within the context of this abstraction, and (d)
leverages this understanding in a two-stage architecture: a repair stage that
proposes fine-grained fixes, followed by a reviewer stage that filters relevant
fixes based on the inferred issue-semantics. Our evaluations show that our
methodology achieves a solve rate of 44.66% on the SWEBench-Lite benchmark
beating all other workflow-based approaches, and an absolute improvement of
7.66% compared to our baseline, which lacks such deep semantic understanding.
We note that our approach performs particularly well on issues requiring
multi-line reasoning (and editing) and edge-case handling, suggesting that
incorporating issue and code semantics into APR pipelines can lead to robust
and semantically consistent repairs.

Abstract: Large-language-model coding tools are now mainstream in software engineering.

present fresh dangers: 10% of real prompts leak private data, 42% of generated

ideas, a trait called sycophancy. We argue that firms must tag and review every

on-premises deployments, obey emerging safety regulations, and add tests that
catch sycophantic answers -- so they can gain speed without losing security and
accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前心理学研究中，LLMs被广泛用作工具或模型，但人类测量工具的误用可能导致虚假发现，亟需建立更严谨的验证标准。

Method: 提出双效度框架，根据科学目标的不同调整验证标准，区分测量、表征、模拟和建模心理构念的需求。

Result: 现有实践常将统计模式匹配误认为心理现象证据，缺乏针对不同研究目标的验证策略。

Conclusion: 未来需开发心理构念的计算类比，并建立清晰、可扩展的证据标准，而非盲目套用人类测量工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly being adopted across psychology,
serving as research tools, experimental subjects, human simulators, and
computational models of cognition. However, the application of human
measurement tools to these systems can produce contradictory results, raising
concerns that many findings are measurement phantoms--statistical artifacts
rather than genuine psychological phenomena. In this Perspective, we argue that
building a robust science of AI psychology requires integrating two of our
field's foundational pillars: the principles of reliable measurement and the
standards for sound causal inference. We present a dual-validity framework to
guide this integration, which clarifies how the evidence needed to support a
claim scales with its scientific ambition. Using an LLM to classify text may
require only basic accuracy checks, whereas claiming it can simulate anxiety
demands a far more rigorous validation process. Current practice systematically
fails to meet these requirements, often treating statistical pattern matching
as evidence of psychological phenomena. The same model output--endorsing "I am
anxious"--requires different validation strategies depending on whether
researchers claim to measure, characterize, simulate, or model psychological
constructs. Moving forward requires developing computational analogues of
psychological constructs and establishing clear, scalable standards of evidence
rather than the uncritical application of human measurement tools.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer emerging opportunities for psychological
and behavioral research, but methodological guidance is lacking. This article
provides a framework for using LLMs as psychological simulators across two
primary applications: simulating roles and personas to explore diverse
contexts, and serving as computational models to investigate cognitive
processes. For simulation, we present methods for developing psychologically
grounded personas that move beyond demographic categories, with strategies for
validation against human data and use cases ranging from studying inaccessible
populations to prototyping research instruments. For cognitive modeling, we
synthesize emerging approaches for probing internal representations,
methodological advances in causal interventions, and strategies for relating
model behavior to human cognition. We address overarching challenges including
prompt sensitivity, temporal limitations from training data cutoffs, and
ethical considerations that extend beyond traditional human subjects review.
Throughout, we emphasize the need for transparency about model capabilities and
constraints. Together, this framework integrates emerging empirical evidence
about LLM performance--including systematic biases, cultural limitations, and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Result: 实验表明，该方法在旅行模式识别任务中显著提升了性能，减少了对手工特征的依赖。

Conclusion: TrajSceneLLM展示了在捕捉时空依赖性和提升语义理解方面的优势，具有广泛的下游应用潜力。

Abstract: GPS trajectory data reveals valuable patterns of human mobility and urban
dynamics, supporting a variety of spatial applications. However, traditional
methods often struggle to extract deep semantic representations and incorporate
contextual map information. We propose TrajSceneLLM, a multimodal perspective
for enhancing semantic understanding of GPS trajectories. The framework
integrates visualized map images (encoding spatial context) and textual
descriptions generated through LLM reasoning (capturing temporal sequences and
movement dynamics). Separate embeddings are generated for each modality and
then concatenated to produce trajectory scene embeddings with rich semantic
content which are further paired with a simple MLP classifier. We validate the
proposed framework on Travel Mode Identification (TMI), a critical task for
analyzing travel choices and understanding mobility behavior. Our experiments
show that these embeddings achieve significant performance improvement,
highlighting the advantage of our LLM-driven method in capturing deep
spatio-temporal dependencies and reducing reliance on handcrafted features.
This semantic enhancement promises significant potential for diverse downstream
applications and future research in geospatial artificial intelligence. The

TL;DR: 研究探讨了基于LLM的机器人是否能扩大在线政治讨论中的观点范围，通过实验证明其能显著增加讨论的多样性，且AI身份披露不影响效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线政治讨论常因自我选择和同质化交流导致观点单一，影响民主参与。研究旨在探索LLM机器人是否能改善这一问题。

Method: 通过两项预注册随机实验，在聊天室中测试机器人主动引入缺失观点的效果。

Result: 机器人显著扩大了讨论中的观点范围，且AI身份披露未显著影响效果。

Conclusion: LLM工具可有效促进在线政治讨论的多样性。

Abstract: A wide range of participation is essential for democracy, as it helps prevent
the dominance of extreme views, erosion of legitimacy, and political
polarization. However, engagement in online political discussions often
features a limited spectrum of views due to high levels of self-selection and
the tendency of online platforms to facilitate exchanges primarily among
like-minded individuals. This study examines whether an LLM-based bot can widen
the scope of perspectives expressed by participants in online discussions
through two pre-registered randomized experiments conducted in a chatroom. We
evaluate the impact of a bot that actively monitors discussions, identifies
missing arguments, and introduces them into the conversation. The results
indicate that our bot significantly expands the range of arguments, as measured
by both objective and subjective metrics. Furthermore, disclosure of the bot as
AI does not significantly alter these effects. These findings suggest that
LLM-based moderation tools can positively influence online political discourse.

TL;DR: 论文研究了在几何数据变换（如旋转或翻转）下的共形预测问题，提出通过整合几何信息（如姿态）来恢复其保证并增强鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 共形预测在分布偏移下实用性降低，尤其是几何变换会破坏模型性能，因此需要一种方法来恢复其保证。

Method: 整合几何信息（如姿态规范化）到共形预测中，评估其在离散和连续变换下的表现。

Result: 结合几何信息与共形预测能够有效应对几何变换，同时适用于黑盒预测器。

Conclusion: 整合几何信息是解决几何变换下共形预测问题的有效方法，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: We study the problem of conformal prediction (CP) under geometric data
shifts, where data samples are susceptible to transformations such as rotations
or flips. While CP endows prediction models with post-hoc uncertainty
quantification and formal coverage guarantees, their practicality breaks under
distribution shifts that deteriorate model performance. To address this issue,
we propose integrating geometric information--such as geometric pose--into the
conformal procedure to reinstate its guarantees and ensure robustness under
geometric shifts. In particular, we explore recent advancements on pose
canonicalization as a suitable information extractor for this purpose.
Evaluating the combined approach across discrete and continuous shifts and
against equivariant and augmentation-based baselines, we find that integrating
geometric information with CP yields a principled way to address geometric
shifts while maintaining broad applicability to black-box predictors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统生成模型（如归一化流）在高维设置中收敛慢，且难以精确逼近真实数据分布。

Method: 通过潜在噪声注入方法，在潜在空间中扰动数据点并映射回数据域，保持观测数据与合成数据的一一对应关系。

Conclusion: 潜在噪声注入是隐私敏感领域（如生物医学研究）中传统流采样方法的有效替代方案。

Abstract: Synthetic Data Generation has become essential for scalable,
privacy-preserving statistical analysis. While standard approaches based on
generative models, such as Normalizing Flows, have been widely used, they often
suffer from slow convergence in high-dimensional settings, frequently
converging more slowly than the canonical $1/\sqrt{n}$ rate when approximating
the true data distribution.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose a Latent Noise Injection method
using Masked Autoregressive Flows (MAF). Instead of directly sampling from the
trained model, our method perturbs each data point in the latent space and maps
it back to the data domain. This construction preserves a one to one
correspondence between observed and synthetic data, enabling synthetic outputs
that closely reflect the underlying distribution, particularly in challenging
high-dimensional regimes where traditional sampling struggles.
  Our procedure satisfies local $(\epsilon, \delta)$-differential privacy and
introduces a single perturbation parameter to control the privacy-utility
trade-off. Although estimators based on individual synthetic datasets may
converge slowly, we show both theoretically and empirically that aggregating
across $K$ studies in a meta analysis framework restores classical efficiency
and yields consistent, reliable inference. We demonstrate that with a
well-calibrated perturbation parameter, Latent Noise Injection achieves strong
statistical alignment with the original data and robustness against membership
inference attacks. These results position our method as a compelling
alternative to conventional flow-based sampling for synthetic data sharing in
decentralized and privacy-sensitive domains, such as biomedical research.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合经典规划与大型语言模型（LLMs）的方法，以解决机器人任务规划中的适应性和可行性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典规划方法在真实场景中因感知限制和难以将感知映射到规划谓词而表现不佳，而LLMs虽能利用常识推理但常生成不可行或不安全的计划。

Method: 通过分层规划框架，结合LLMs的常识推理能力，逐步放松目标定义，使不可行任务变得可处理。

Result: 方法在3D场景图中表现出高效的任务适应和执行能力，优于其他基准方法。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了复杂场景中的规划问题，并开源了代码和数据集。

Abstract: Classical planning in AI and Robotics addresses complex tasks by shifting
from imperative to declarative approaches (e.g., PDDL). However, these methods
often fail in real scenarios due to limited robot perception and the need to
ground perceptions to planning predicates. This often results in heavily
hard-coded behaviors that struggle to adapt, even with scenarios where goals
can be achieved through relaxed planning. Meanwhile, Large Language Models
(LLMs) lead to planning systems that leverage commonsense reasoning but often
at the cost of generating unfeasible and/or unsafe plans. To address these
limitations, we present an approach integrating classical planning with LLMs,
leveraging their ability to extract commonsense knowledge and ground actions.
We propose a hierarchical formulation that enables robots to make unfeasible
tasks tractable by defining functionally equivalent goals through gradual
relaxation. This mechanism supports partial achievement of the intended
objective, suited to the agent's specific context. Our method demonstrates its
ability to adapt and execute tasks effectively within environments modeled
using 3D Scene Graphs through comprehensive qualitative and quantitative
evaluations. We also show how this method succeeds in complex scenarios where
other benchmark methods are more likely to fail. Code, dataset, and additional
material are released to the community.

Method: 解析视频为分段，推断语义变化和动作，转换为第一人称视角，并通过安全Q函数验证候选动作。

Result: 实验表明，SafeMimic能从单次演示中安全高效学习多步移动操作行为，优于现有基线。

Conclusion: SafeMimic为机器人学习复杂任务提供了一种安全自主的方法，减少了未来尝试中的探索需求。

Abstract: For robots to become efficient helpers in the home, they must learn to
perform new mobile manipulation tasks simply by watching humans perform them.
Learning from a single video demonstration from a human is challenging as the
robot needs to first extract from the demo what needs to be done and how,
translate the strategy from a third to a first-person perspective, and then
adapt it to be successful with its own morphology. Furthermore, to mitigate the
dependency on costly human monitoring, this learning process should be
performed in a safe and autonomous manner. We present SafeMimic, a framework to
learn new mobile manipulation skills safely and autonomously from a single
third-person human video. Given an initial human video demonstration of a
multi-step mobile manipulation task, SafeMimic first parses the video into
segments, inferring both the semantic changes caused and the motions the human
executed to achieve them and translating them to an egocentric reference. Then,
it adapts the behavior to the robot's own morphology by sampling candidate
actions around the human ones, and verifying them for safety before execution
in a receding horizon fashion using an ensemble of safety Q-functions trained
in simulation. When safe forward progression is not possible, SafeMimic
backtracks to previous states and attempts a different sequence of actions,
adapting both the trajectory and the grasping modes when required for its
morphology. As a result, SafeMimic yields a strategy that succeeds in the
demonstrated behavior and learns task-specific actions that reduce exploration
in future attempts. Our experiments show that our method allows robots to
safely and efficiently learn multi-step mobile manipulation behaviors from a
single human demonstration, from different users, and in different
environments, with improvements over state-of-the-art baselines across seven
tasks

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a prominent research
area, showcasing significant potential across a variety of applications.
However, their performance in endoscopy robotics, particularly endoscopy
capsule robots that perform actions within the digestive system, remains
unexplored. The integration of VLA models into endoscopy robots allows more
intuitive and efficient interactions between human operators and medical
devices, improving both diagnostic accuracy and treatment outcomes. In this
work, we design CapsDT, a Diffusion Transformer model for capsule robot
manipulation in the stomach. By processing interleaved visual inputs, and
textual instructions, CapsDT can infer corresponding robotic control signals to
facilitate endoscopy tasks. In addition, we developed a capsule endoscopy robot
system, a capsule robot controlled by a robotic arm-held magnet, addressing
different levels of four endoscopy tasks and creating corresponding capsule
robot datasets within the stomach simulator. Comprehensive evaluations on
various robotic tasks indicate that CapsDT can serve as a robust
vision-language generalist, achieving state-of-the-art performance in various
levels of endoscopy tasks while achieving a 26.25% success rate in real-world

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在长距离路径中，基于密集全局激光雷达地图的实时定位可能困难且内存消耗大，因此需要利用拓扑地图。

Method: 提出PRISM-Loc，采用双重定位流程：全局地点识别和局部位姿估计（基于2D特征和点优化）。

Result: 在3公里路径的ITLP-Campus数据集上测试，PRISM-Loc在质量和计算效率上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PRISM-Loc是一种高效且性能优越的拓扑地图定位方法，适用于大型环境。

Abstract: Localization in the environment is one of the crucial tasks of navigation of
a mobile robot or a self-driving vehicle. For long-range routes, performing
localization within a dense global lidar map in real time may be difficult, and
the creation of such a map may require much memory. To this end, leveraging
topological maps may be useful. In this work, we propose PRISM-Loc -- a
topological map-based approach for localization in large environments. The
proposed approach leverages a twofold localization pipeline, which consists of
global place recognition and estimation of the local pose inside the found
location. For local pose estimation, we introduce an original lidar scan
matching algorithm, which is based on 2D features and point-based optimization.
We evaluate the proposed method on the ITLP-Campus dataset on a 3 km route, and
compare it against the state-of-the-art metric map-based and place
recognition-based competitors. The results of the experiments show that the
proposed method outperforms its competitors both quality-wise and
computationally-wise.

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效量化传感器和网络的不确定性，并在不同环境条件下表现出更好的预测性能。

Abstract: The uncertainty quantification of sensor measurements coupled with deep
learning networks is crucial for many robotics systems, especially for
safety-critical applications such as self-driving cars. This paper develops an
uncertainty quantification approach in the context of visual localization for
autonomous driving, where locations are selected based on images. Key to our
approach is to learn the measurement uncertainty using light-weight sensor
error model, which maps both image feature and semantic information to
2-dimensional error distribution. Our approach enables uncertainty estimation
conditioned on the specific context of the matched image pair, implicitly
capturing other critical, unannotated factors (e.g., city vs highway, dynamic
vs static scenes, winter vs summer) in a latent manner. We demonstrate the
accuracy of our uncertainty prediction framework using the Ithaca365 dataset,
which includes variations in lighting and weather (sunny, night, snowy). Both
the uncertainty quantification of the sensor+network is evaluated, along with
Bayesian localization filters using unique sensor gating method. Results show
that the measurement error does not follow a Gaussian distribution with poor
weather and lighting conditions, and is better predicted by our Gaussian
Mixture model.

Result: HetNet在MSC-AD基准上性能提升约10%，并在其他数据集上达到最优效果。

Conclusion: HetNet在复杂工业环境中表现出色，可集成到生产线中实现实时异常检测。

Abstract: Anomaly detection and localization in automated industrial manufacturing can
significantly enhance production efficiency and product quality. Existing
methods are capable of detecting surface defects in pre-defined or controlled
imaging environments. However, accurately detecting workpiece defects in
complex and unstructured industrial environments with varying views, poses and
illumination remains challenging. We propose a novel anomaly detection and
localization method specifically designed to handle inputs with perturbative
patterns. Our approach introduces a new framework based on a collaborative
distillation heterogeneous teacher network (HetNet), an adaptive local-global
feature fusion module, and a local multivariate Gaussian noise generation
module. HetNet can learn to model the complex feature distribution of normal
patterns using limited information about local disruptive changes. We conducted
extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks. HetNet demonstrates superior
performance with approximately 10% improvement across all evaluation metrics on
MSC-AD under industrial conditions, while achieving state-of-the-art results on
other datasets, validating its resilience to environmental fluctuations and its
capability to enhance the reliability of industrial anomaly detection systems
across diverse scenarios. Tests in real-world environments further confirm that
HetNet can be effectively integrated into production lines to achieve robust
and real-time anomaly detection. Codes, images and videos are published on the

Result: 在RLBench基准测试中，FlowRAM的平均成功率提升12.0%，且推理速度显著提高。

Conclusion: FlowRAM在高精度任务中表现优异，为机器人操作提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Robotic manipulation in high-precision tasks is essential for numerous
industrial and real-world applications where accuracy and speed are required.
Yet current diffusion-based policy learning methods generally suffer from low
computational efficiency due to the iterative denoising process during
inference. Moreover, these methods do not fully explore the potential of
generative models for enhancing information exploration in 3D environments. In
response, we propose FlowRAM, a novel framework that leverages generative
models to achieve region-aware perception, enabling efficient multimodal
information processing. Specifically, we devise a Dynamic Radius Schedule,
which allows adaptive perception, facilitating transitions from global scene
comprehension to fine-grained geometric details. Furthermore, we integrate
state space models to integrate multimodal information, while preserving linear
computational complexity. In addition, we employ conditional flow matching to
learn action poses by regressing deterministic vector fields, simplifying the
learning process while maintaining performance. We verify the effectiveness of
the FlowRAM in the RLBench, an established manipulation benchmark, and achieve
state-of-the-art performance. The results demonstrate that FlowRAM achieves a
remarkable improvement, particularly in high-precision tasks, where it
outperforms previous methods by 12.0% in average success rate. Additionally,
FlowRAM is able to generate physically plausible actions for a variety of
real-world tasks in less than 4 time steps, significantly increasing inference
speed.

task execution in dynamic environments. The system decomposes natural language
instructions into structured action triplets, which are grounded in contextual
environmental data provided by the SDT. This semantic grounding allows the
robot to interpret object affordances and interaction rules, enabling action
planning and real-time adaptability. In case of execution failures, the LLM
utilizes error feedback and SDT insights to generate recovery strategies and
iteratively revise the action plan. We evaluate our approach using tasks from
the ALFRED benchmark, demonstrating robust performance across various household
scenarios. The proposed framework effectively combines high-level reasoning
with semantic environment understanding, achieving reliable task completion in

Method: ReOI通过检测干扰物、修改观测、重新预测并恢复干扰物，提升预测准确性。

Result: 实验表明，ReOI显著提升了任务成功率，尤其在存在新干扰物时效果突出。

Conclusion: ReOI是一种简单有效的策略，能增强世界模型在开放环境中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: World models enable robots to "imagine" future observations given current
observations and planned actions, and have been increasingly adopted as
generalized dynamics models to facilitate robot learning. Despite their
promise, these models remain brittle when encountering novel visual distractors
such as objects and background elements rarely seen during training.
Specifically, novel distractors can corrupt action outcome predictions, causing
downstream failures when robots rely on the world model imaginations for
planning or action verification. In this work, we propose Reimagination with
Observation Intervention (ReOI), a simple yet effective test-time strategy that
enables world models to predict more reliable action outcomes in open-world
scenarios where novel and unanticipated visual distractors are inevitable.
Given the current robot observation, ReOI first detects visual distractors by
identifying which elements of the scene degrade in physically implausible ways
during world model prediction. Then, it modifies the current observation to
remove these distractors and bring the observation closer to the training
distribution. Finally, ReOI "reimagines" future outcomes with the modified
observation and reintroduces the distractors post-hoc to preserve visual
consistency for downstream planning and verification. We validate our approach
on a suite of robotic manipulation tasks in the context of action verification,
where the verifier needs to select desired action plans based on predictions
from a world model. Our results show that ReOI is robust to both
in-distribution and out-of-distribution visual distractors. Notably, it
improves task success rates by up to 3x in the presence of novel distractors,
significantly outperforming action verification that relies on world model
predictions without imagination interventions.

Conclusion: BIDA在动态交通场景中表现出优越的安全性和交互理性，为自动驾驶车辆的决策提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In complex real-world traffic environments, autonomous vehicles (AVs) need to
interact with other traffic participants while making real-time and
safety-critical decisions accordingly. The unpredictability of human behaviors
poses significant challenges, particularly in dynamic scenarios, such as
multi-lane highways and unsignalized T-intersections. To address this gap, we
design a bi-level interaction decision-making algorithm (BIDA) that integrates
interactive Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) with deep reinforcement learning
(DRL), aiming to enhance interaction rationality, efficiency and safety of AVs
in dynamic key traffic scenarios. Specifically, we adopt three types of DRL
algorithms to construct a reliable value network and policy network, which
guide the online deduction process of interactive MCTS by assisting in value
update and node selection. Then, a dynamic trajectory planner and a trajectory
tracking controller are designed and implemented in CARLA to ensure smooth
execution of planned maneuvers. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our
BIDA not only enhances interactive deduction and reduces computational costs,
but also outperforms other latest benchmarks, which exhibits superior safety,

Abstract: Natural language instructions for robotic manipulation tasks often exhibit
ambiguity and vagueness. For instance, the instruction "Hang a mug on the mug
tree" may involve multiple valid actions if there are several mugs and branches
to choose from. Existing language-conditioned policies typically rely on
end-to-end models that jointly handle high-level semantic understanding and
low-level action generation, which can result in suboptimal performance due to
their lack of modularity and interpretability. To address these challenges, we
introduce a novel robotic manipulation framework that can accomplish tasks
specified by potentially ambiguous natural language. This framework employs a
Vision-Language Model (VLM) to interpret abstract concepts in natural language
instructions and generates task-specific code - an interpretable and executable
intermediate representation. The generated code interfaces with the perception
module to produce 3D attention maps that highlight task-relevant regions by
integrating spatial and semantic information, effectively resolving ambiguities
in instructions. Through extensive experiments, we identify key limitations of
current imitation learning methods, such as poor adaptation to language and
environmental variations. We show that our approach excels across challenging
manipulation tasks involving language ambiguity, contact-rich manipulation, and
multi-object interactions.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种零样本目标导航框架，通过动态历史感知提示深度整合视觉语言模型（VLM）推理，提升导航性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前目标导航方法对VLM的利用较浅，仅用于对象-场景相似性检查，缺乏深度推理，导致上下文理解不足和重复导航行为。

Method: 采用动态历史感知提示，为VLM提供动作历史上下文，生成导航动作的语义指导分数，并避免决策循环；引入VLM辅助的路径点生成机制优化目标接近。

Result: 在HM3D数据集上实现了46%的成功率（SR）和24.8%的路径加权成功率（SPL），与现有零样本方法相当。

Conclusion: 历史增强的VLM提示策略显著提升了导航的鲁棒性和上下文感知能力。

Abstract: Object Goal Navigation (ObjectNav) challenges robots to find objects in
unseen environments, demanding sophisticated reasoning. While Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) show potential, current ObjectNav methods often employ them
superficially, primarily using vision-language embeddings for object-scene
similarity checks rather than leveraging deeper reasoning. This limits
contextual understanding and leads to practical issues like repetitive
navigation behaviors. This paper introduces a novel zero-shot ObjectNav
framework that pioneers the use of dynamic, history-aware prompting to more
deeply integrate VLM reasoning into frontier-based exploration. Our core
innovation lies in providing the VLM with action history context, enabling it
to generate semantic guidance scores for navigation actions while actively
avoiding decision loops. We also introduce a VLM-assisted waypoint generation
mechanism for refining the final approach to detected objects. Evaluated on the
HM3D dataset within Habitat, our approach achieves a 46% Success Rate (SR) and
24.8% Success weighted by Path Length (SPL). These results are comparable to
state-of-the-art zero-shot methods, demonstrating the significant potential of
our history-augmented VLM prompting strategy for more robust and context-aware
robotic navigation.

Motivation: 解决现有6D姿态估计依赖昂贵深度传感器且无法处理透明物体的问题，同时改进单目深度估计模型的度量深度恢复能力。

Method: 提出MOMA框架，通过相机校准中的尺度-旋转-平移对齐，结合稀疏真实深度点，实现无需额外数据或模型重训练的准确深度估计。

Result: MOMA在透明物体上表现良好，并在真实世界的抓取和分拣任务中取得高成功率。

Conclusion: MOMA是一种高效的单目度量深度恢复方法，适用于多样化的机器人操作任务。

Abstract: Accurate 6D object pose estimation is a prerequisite for successfully
completing robotic prehensile and non-prehensile manipulation tasks. At
present, 6D pose estimation for robotic manipulation generally relies on depth
sensors based on, e.g., structured light, time-of-flight, and stereo-vision,
which can be expensive, produce noisy output (as compared with RGB cameras),
and fail to handle transparent objects. On the other hand, state-of-the-art
monocular depth estimation models (MDEMs) provide only affine-invariant depths
up to an unknown scale and shift. Metric MDEMs achieve some successful
zero-shot results on public datasets, but fail to generalize. We propose a
novel framework, Monocular One-shot Metric-depth Alignment (MOMA), to recover
metric depth from a single RGB image, through a one-shot adaptation building on
MDEM techniques. MOMA performs scale-rotation-shift alignments during camera
calibration, guided by sparse ground-truth depth points, enabling accurate
depth estimation without additional data collection or model retraining on the
testing setup. MOMA supports fine-tuning the MDEM on transparent objects,
demonstrating strong generalization capabilities. Real-world experiments on
tabletop 2-finger grasping and suction-based bin-picking applications show MOMA
achieves high success rates in diverse tasks, confirming its effectiveness.

Abstract: Generating large-scale demonstrations for dexterous hand manipulation remains
challenging, and several approaches have been proposed in recent years to

high-quality demonstration dataset produced with generative models. The dataset
contains one billion demonstrations for two fundamental tasks: grasping and
articulation. To construct it, we propose a generative model that integrates
geometric constraints to improve feasibility and applies additional conditions
to enhance diversity. We validate the model on both established and newly
introduced simulation benchmarks, where it significantly outperforms prior
state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate its effectiveness and
robustness through real-world robot experiments. Our project page is at

Conclusion: 策略在物体交接任务中表现出高效性和鲁棒性，适用于实际协作场景。

Abstract: Object handover is an important skill that we use daily when interacting with
other humans. To deploy robots in collaborative setting, like houses, being
able to receive and handing over objects safely and efficiently becomes a
crucial skill. In this work, we demonstrate the use of Reinforcement Learning
(RL) for dexterous object handover between two multi-finger hands. Key to this
task is the use of a novel reward function based on dual quaternions to
minimize the rotation distance, which outperforms other rotation
representations such as Euler and rotation matrices. The robustness of the
trained policy is experimentally evaluated by testing w.r.t. objects that are
not included in the training distribution, and perturbations during the
handover process. The results demonstrate that the trained policy successfully
perform this task, achieving a total success rate of 94% in the best-case
scenario after 100 experiments, thereby showing the robustness of our policy
with novel objects. In addition, the best-case performance of the policy
decreases by only 13.8% when the other robot moves during the handover, proving
that our policy is also robust to this type of perturbation, which is common in
real-world object handovers.

Motivation: 大规模语言模型（LLM）的分布式训练成本高昂且缺乏验证，容易导致错误和资源浪费。

Result: 成功验证了包括Llama3（405B）和DeepSeek-V3（671B）在内的前沿LLM训练计划。

Conclusion: TrainVerify为LLM的分布式训练提供了高效且可靠的验证方法，显著减少了潜在错误和资源浪费。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) at scale requires parallel execution
across thousands of devices, incurring enormous computational costs. Yet, these
costly distributed trainings are rarely verified, leaving them prone to silent
errors and potentially wasting millions of GPU hours. We introduce TrainVerify,
a system for verifiable distributed training of LLMs. Given a deep learning
model's logical specification as the ground truth, TrainVerify formally
verifies that a distributed parallel execution plan is mathematically
equivalent to it. Direct verification is notoriously difficult due to the sheer
scale of LLMs which often involves billions of variables and highly intricate
computation graphs. Therefore, TrainVerify introduces shape-reduction
techniques and a stage-wise parallel verification algorithm that significantly
reduces complexity while preserving formal correctness. TrainVerify scales to
frontier LLMs, including the successful verification of the Llama3 (405B) and
DeepSeek-V3 (671B) training plans.

Result: 在三个大数据集上，MoNetV2在重建质量和泛化性能上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MoNetV2显著提升了3D超声重建的准确性和适应性，适用于不同扫描速度和策略。

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound (US) aims to provide sonographers with the
spatial relationships of anatomical structures, playing a crucial role in
clinical diagnosis. Recently, deep-learning-based freehand 3D US has made
significant advancements. It reconstructs volumes by estimating transformations
between images without external tracking. However, image-only reconstruction
poses difficulties in reducing cumulative drift and further improving
reconstruction accuracy, particularly in scenarios involving complex motion
trajectories. In this context, we propose an enhanced motion network (MoNetV2)
to enhance the accuracy and generalizability of reconstruction under diverse
scanning velocities and tactics. First, we propose a sensor-based temporal and
multi-branch structure that fuses image and motion information from a velocity
perspective to improve image-only reconstruction accuracy. Second, we devise an
online multi-level consistency constraint that exploits the inherent
consistency of scans to handle various scanning velocities and tactics. This
constraint exploits both scan-level velocity consistency, path-level appearance
consistency, and patch-level motion consistency to supervise inter-frame
transformation estimation. Third, we distill an online multi-modal
self-supervised strategy that leverages the correlation between network
estimation and motion information to further reduce cumulative errors.
Extensive experiments clearly demonstrate that MoNetV2 surpasses existing
methods in both reconstruction quality and generalizability performance across
three large datasets.

Method: 提出HistoStainAlign框架，通过对比训练策略整合H&E和IHC嵌入，学习形态和分子特征的联合表示。

Result: 在胃肠道和肺组织WSIs上评估，对P53、PD-L1和Ki-67三种IHC染色分别获得加权F1分数0.735、0.830和0.723。

Conclusion: 研究表明计算方法可作为预筛查工具，优化IHC染色工作流程，提高效率。

Abstract: Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining is a cornerstone of pathological
analysis, offering reliable visualization of cellular morphology and tissue
architecture for cancer diagnosis, subtyping, and grading. Immunohistochemistry
(IHC) staining provides molecular insights by detecting specific proteins
within tissues, enhancing diagnostic accuracy, and improving treatment
planning. However, IHC staining is costly, time-consuming, and
resource-intensive, requiring specialized expertise. To address these
limitations, this study proposes HistoStainAlign, a novel deep learning
framework that predicts IHC staining patterns directly from H&E whole-slide
images (WSIs) by learning joint representations of morphological and molecular
features. The framework integrates paired H&E and IHC embeddings through a
contrastive training strategy, capturing complementary features across staining
modalities without patch-level annotations or tissue registration. The model
was evaluated on gastrointestinal and lung tissue WSIs with three commonly used
IHC stains: P53, PD-L1, and Ki-67. HistoStainAlign achieved weighted F1 scores
of 0.735 [95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.670-0.799], 0.830 [95% CI:
0.772-0.886], and 0.723 [95% CI: 0.607-0.836], respectively for these three IHC
stains. Embedding analyses demonstrated the robustness of the contrastive
alignment in capturing meaningful cross-stain relationships. Comparisons with a
baseline model further highlight the advantage of incorporating contrastive
learning for improved stain pattern prediction. This study demonstrates the
potential of computational approaches to serve as a pre-screening tool, helping
prioritize cases for IHC staining and improving workflow efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在处理流视频时KV缓存线性增长导致的内存溢出问题，适用于边缘设备。

Method: 采用轻量级压缩策略：通过时间轴冗余（TaR）度量去除冗余令牌，通过值范数（VaN）排名保留语义重要令牌。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，峰值GPU内存降低94%，实时生成性能保持，准确性匹配或优于全缓存方法。

Conclusion: InfiniPot-V无需重新训练或查询知识，为设备端流视频助手提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Modern multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can reason over hour-long
video, yet their key-value (KV) cache grows linearly with time--quickly
exceeding the fixed memory of phones, AR glasses, and edge robots. Prior
compression schemes either assume the whole video and user query are available
offline or must first build the full cache, so memory still scales with stream
length. InfiniPot-V is the first training-free, query-agnostic framework that
enforces a hard, length-independent memory cap for streaming video
understanding. During video encoding it monitors the cache and, once a user-set
threshold is reached, runs a lightweight compression pass that (i) removes
temporally redundant tokens via Temporal-axis Redundancy (TaR) metric and (ii)
keeps semantically significant tokens via Value-Norm (VaN) ranking. Across four
open-source MLLMs and four long-video and two streaming-video benchmarks,
InfiniPot-V cuts peak GPU memory by up to 94%, sustains real-time generation,
and matches or surpasses full-cache accuracy--even in multi-turn dialogues. By
dissolving the KV cache bottleneck without retraining or query knowledge,
InfiniPot-V closes the gap for on-device streaming video assistants.

Abstract: Segmenting anatomical structures in medical images plays an important role in
the quantitative assessment of various diseases. However, accurate segmentation
becomes significantly more challenging in the presence of disease. Disease
patterns can alter the appearance of surrounding healthy tissues, introduce
ambiguous boundaries, or even obscure critical anatomical structures. As such,
segmentation models trained on real-world datasets may struggle to provide good
anatomical segmentation, leading to potential misdiagnosis. In this paper, we
generate counterfactual (CF) images to simulate how the same anatomy would
appear in the absence of disease without altering the underlying structure. We
then use these CF images to segment structures of interest, without requiring
any changes to the underlying segmentation model. Our experiments on two
real-world clinical chest X-ray datasets show that the use of counterfactual
images improves anatomical segmentation, thereby aiding downstream clinical
decision-making.

Abstract: Class imbalance and the difficulty imbalance are the two types of data
imbalance that affect the performance of neural networks in medical
segmentation tasks. In class imbalance the loss is dominated by the majority
classes and in difficulty imbalance the loss is dominated by easy to classify
pixels. This leads to an ineffective training. Dice loss, which is based on a
geometrical metric, is very effective in addressing the class imbalance
compared to the cross entropy (CE) loss, which is adopted directly from
classification tasks. To address the difficulty imbalance, the common approach
is employing a re-weighted CE loss or a modified Dice loss to focus the
training on difficult to classify areas. The existing modification methods are
computationally costly and with limited success. In this study we propose a
simple modification to the Dice loss with minimal computational cost. With a
pixel level modulating term, we take advantage of the effectiveness of Dice
loss in handling the class imbalance to also handle the difficulty imbalance.
Results on three commonly used medical segmentation tasks show that the
proposed Pixel-wise Modulated Dice loss (PM Dice loss) outperforms other
methods, which are designed to tackle the difficulty imbalance problem.

Abstract: Automated grading of Knee Osteoarthritis (KOA) from radiographs is challenged
by significant inter-observer variability and the limited robustness of deep
learning models, particularly near critical decision boundaries. To address
these limitations, this paper proposes a novel framework, Diffusion-based
Counterfactual Augmentation (DCA), which enhances model robustness and
interpretability by generating targeted counterfactual examples. The method
navigates the latent space of a diffusion model using a Stochastic Differential
Equation (SDE), governed by balancing a classifier-informed boundary drive with
a manifold constraint. The resulting counterfactuals are then used within a
self-corrective learning strategy to improve the classifier by focusing on its
specific areas of uncertainty. Extensive experiments on the public
Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) and Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study (MOST)
datasets demonstrate that this approach significantly improves classification
accuracy across multiple model architectures. Furthermore, the method provides
interpretability by visualizing minimal pathological changes and revealing that
the learned latent space topology aligns with clinical knowledge of KOA
progression. The DCA framework effectively converts model uncertainty into a
robust training signal, offering a promising pathway to developing more
accurate and trustworthy automated diagnostic systems. Our code is available at

Abstract: Training-free perceptual image codec adopt pre-trained unconditional
generative model during decoding to avoid training new conditional generative
model. However, they heavily rely on diffusion inversion or sample
communication, which take 1 min to intractable amount of time to decode a
single image. In this paper, we propose a training-free algorithm that improves
the perceptual quality of any existing codec with theoretical guarantee. We
further propose different implementations for optimal perceptual quality when
decoding time budget is $\approx 0.1$s, $0.1-10$s and $\ge 10$s. Our approach:
1). improves the decoding time of training-free codec from 1 min to $0.1-10$s
with comparable perceptual quality. 2). can be applied to non-differentiable
codec such as VTM. 3). can be used to improve previous perceptual codecs, such
as MS-ILLM. 4). can easily achieve perception-distortion trade-off.
Empirically, we show that our approach successfully improves the perceptual
quality of ELIC, VTM and MS-ILLM with fast decoding. Our approach achieves
comparable FID to previous training-free codec with significantly less decoding
time. And our approach still outperforms previous conditional generative model
based codecs such as HiFiC and MS-ILLM in terms of FID. The source code is

Conclusion: 该方法提升了远程皮肤病学中图像质量管理的效果。

Abstract: Teledermatology has become a widely accepted communication method in daily
clinical practice, enabling remote care while showing strong agreement with
in-person visits. Poor image quality remains an unsolved problem in
teledermatology and is a major concern to practitioners, as bad-quality images
reduce the usefulness of the remote consultation process. However, research on
Image Quality Assessment (IQA) in dermatology is sparse, and does not leverage
the latest advances in non-dermatology IQA, such as using larger image
databases with ratings from large groups of human observers. In this work, we
propose cross-domain training of IQA models, combining dermatology and
non-dermatology IQA datasets. For this purpose, we created a novel dermatology
IQA database, Legit.Health-DIQA-Artificial, using dermatology images from
several sources and having them annotated by a group of human observers. We
demonstrate that cross-domain training yields optimal performance across
domains and overcomes one of the biggest limitations in dermatology IQA, which
is the small scale of data, and leads to models trained on a larger pool of
image distortions, resulting in a better management of image quality in the
teledermatology process.

Abstract: In motion-robust magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), slice-to-volume
reconstruction is critical for recovering anatomically consistent 3D brain
volumes from 2D slices, especially under accelerated acquisitions or patient
motion. However, this task remains challenging due to hierarchical structural
disruptions. It includes local detail loss from k-space undersampling, global
structural aliasing caused by motion, and volumetric anisotropy. Therefore, we
propose a progressive refinement implicit neural representation (PR-INR)
framework. Our PR-INR unifies motion correction, structural refinement, and
volumetric synthesis within a geometry-aware coordinate space. Specifically, a
motion-aware diffusion module is first employed to generate coarse volumetric
reconstructions that suppress motion artifacts and preserve global anatomical
structures. Then, we introduce an implicit detail restoration module that
performs residual refinement by aligning spatial coordinates with visual
features. It corrects local structures and enhances boundary precision.
Further, a voxel continuous-aware representation module represents the image as
a continuous function over 3D coordinates. It enables accurate inter-slice
completion and high-frequency detail recovery. We evaluate PR-INR on five
public MRI datasets under various motion conditions (3% and 5% displacement),
undersampling rates (4x and 8x) and slice resolutions (scale = 5). Experimental
results demonstrate that PR-INR outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both
quantitative reconstruction metrics and visual quality. It further shows
generalization and robustness across diverse unseen domains.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习的自动计算孕龄方法，通过新颖的分割架构和距离图解决数据限制和标注稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确估计孕龄对监测胎儿生长至关重要，但传统方法（如末次月经）在某些情况下难以获取，超声方法虽可靠但依赖人工测量，存在变异性。

Method: 采用可解释的深度学习方法，结合新颖的分割架构和距离图，克服数据集限制和标注稀缺问题。

Result: 性能与最先进模型相当，同时降低了复杂性，适用于资源有限和标注数据少的场景；距离图特别适合估计股骨端点。

Conclusion: 该方法在孕龄估计中表现出色，尤其适合资源受限环境，且距离图的应用效果显著。

Abstract: Being born small carries significant health risks, including increased
neonatal mortality and a higher likelihood of future cardiac diseases. Accurate
estimation of gestational age is critical for monitoring fetal growth, but
traditional methods, such as estimation based on the last menstrual period, are
in some situations difficult to obtain. While ultrasound-based approaches offer
greater reliability, they rely on manual measurements that introduce
variability. This study presents an interpretable deep learning-based method
for automated gestational age calculation, leveraging a novel segmentation
architecture and distance maps to overcome dataset limitations and the scarcity
of segmentation masks. Our approach achieves performance comparable to
state-of-the-art models while reducing complexity, making it particularly
suitable for resource-constrained settings and with limited annotated data.
Furthermore, our results demonstrate that the use of distance maps is
particularly suitable for estimating femur endpoints.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: VesselSDF提出了一种基于符号距离场（SDF）的新方法，用于从稀疏CT扫描切片中准确分割血管网络，解决了现有方法在结构连续性和几何保真度上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏CT扫描切片中血管网络的准确分割存在挑战，尤其是血管的细分支结构和切片间的稀疏性。现有深度学习方法在结构连续性和几何保真度上表现不佳。

Method: VesselSDF将血管分割问题转化为连续的SDF回归问题，通过自适应高斯正则化消除SDF的常见伪影，确保远离血管表面的区域平滑，同时保留表面边界的精确几何。

Result: 实验表明，VesselSDF显著优于现有方法，能够更好地保留血管的几何结构和连通性。

Conclusion: VesselSDF为临床环境中的血管分析提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of vascular networks from sparse CT scan slices remains
a significant challenge in medical imaging, particularly due to the thin,
branching nature of vessels and the inherent sparsity between imaging planes.
Existing deep learning approaches, based on binary voxel classification, often
struggle with structural continuity and geometric fidelity. To address this
challenge, we present VesselSDF, a novel framework that leverages signed
distance fields (SDFs) for robust vessel reconstruction. Our method
reformulates vessel segmentation as a continuous SDF regression problem, where
each point in the volume is represented by its signed distance to the nearest
vessel surface. This continuous representation inherently captures the smooth,
tubular geometry of blood vessels and their branching patterns. We obtain
accurate vessel reconstructions while eliminating common SDF artifacts such as
floating segments, thanks to our adaptive Gaussian regularizer which ensures
smoothness in regions far from vessel surfaces while producing precise geometry
near the surface boundaries. Our experimental results demonstrate that
VesselSDF significantly outperforms existing methods and preserves vessel
geometry and connectivity, enabling more reliable vascular analysis in clinical
settings.

TL;DR: DiffO是一种单步扩散模型，用于图像压缩，在极低比特率下提供高质量和快速解码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像压缩方法在极低比特率下质量下降严重，且扩散模型解码延迟高。

Method: 结合VQ残差训练和速率自适应噪声调制，捕捉全局几何和高频细节。

Result: DiffO在压缩性能和解码速度上优于现有方法，速度提升约50倍。

Conclusion: DiffO显著提升了生成编解码器的实用性。

Abstract: Although image compression is fundamental to visual data processing and has
inspired numerous standard and learned codecs, these methods still suffer
severe quality degradation at extremely low bits per pixel. While recent
diffusion based models provided enhanced generative performance at low
bitrates, they still yields limited perceptual quality and prohibitive decoding
latency due to multiple denoising steps. In this paper, we propose the first
single step diffusion model for image compression (DiffO) that delivers high
perceptual quality and fast decoding at ultra low bitrates. DiffO achieves
these goals by coupling two key innovations: (i) VQ Residual training, which
factorizes a structural base code and a learned residual in latent space,
capturing both global geometry and high frequency details; and (ii) rate
adaptive noise modulation, which tunes denoising strength on the fly to match
the desired bitrate. Extensive experiments show that DiffO surpasses state of
the art compression performance while improving decoding speed by about 50x
compared to prior diffusion-based methods, greatly improving the practicality
of generative codecs. The code will be available at

Abstract: Breast ultrasound imaging is a valuable tool for early breast cancer
detection, but automated tumor segmentation is challenging due to inherent
noise, variations in scale of lesions, and fuzzy boundaries. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel hybrid attention-based network for lesion
segmentation. Our proposed architecture integrates a pre-trained DenseNet121 in
the encoder part for robust feature extraction with a multi-branch
attention-enhanced decoder tailored for breast ultrasound images. The
bottleneck incorporates Global Spatial Attention (GSA), Position Encoding (PE),
and Scaled Dot-Product Attention (SDPA) to learn global context, spatial
relationships, and relative positional features. The Spatial Feature
Enhancement Block (SFEB) is embedded at skip connections to refine and enhance
spatial features, enabling the network to focus more effectively on tumor
regions. A hybrid loss function combining Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) and
Jaccard Index loss optimizes both pixel-level accuracy and region-level overlap
metrics, enhancing robustness to class imbalance and irregular tumor shapes.
Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing
approaches, highlighting its potential to assist radiologists in early and
accurate breast cancer diagnosis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习模型在组织病理学图像分析中的过拟合问题，并探索模型容量对性能的影响。

Method: 通过实验比较不同架构（如ResNet和ViT）在组织病理学数据集上的表现，验证模型容量与性能的关系。

Result: 增加模型容量不一定提升性能，定制化的简单架构在有限数据集上表现更优且减少过拟合。

Conclusion: 组织病理学图像分析需要专门设计的架构，尤其是在数据有限的情况下。

Abstract: This study investigates the critical problem of overfitting in deep learning
models applied to histopathology image analysis. We show that simply adopting
and fine-tuning large-scale models designed for natural image analysis often
leads to suboptimal performance and significant overfitting when applied to
histopathology tasks. Through extensive experiments with various model
architectures, including ResNet variants and Vision Transformers (ViT), we show
that increasing model capacity does not necessarily improve performance on
histopathology datasets. Our findings emphasize the need for customized
architectures specifically designed for histopathology image analysis,
particularly when working with limited datasets. Using Oesophageal
Adenocarcinomas public dataset, we demonstrate that simpler, domain-specific
architectures can achieve comparable or better performance while minimizing
overfitting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 18F-DOPA在神经内分泌肿瘤和神经系统疾病中具有更高的特异性，但其复杂的合成和临床使用限制阻碍了广泛应用。通过直接在投影域建模，可以减少图像重建过程中的误差累积。

Method: 研究训练了一个粗估计模型和一个先验细化模型，采用高阶混合采样器生成初始合成图像，并通过学习到的先验条件迭代优化。

Result: 实验结果表明，PJDM显著提高了投影域图像质量和合成效果。

Conclusion: PJDM为18F-DOPA PET图像的生成提供了一种有效方法，解决了现有技术的局限性。

Abstract: Positron emission tomography (PET) is widely used to assess metabolic
activity, but its application is limited by the availability of radiotracers.
18F-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) is the most commonly used tracer but
shows limited effectiveness for certain tumors. In contrast,
6-18F-fluoro-3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine (18F-DOPA) offers higher specificity
for neuroendocrine tumors and neurological disorders. However, its complex
synthesis and limitations in transportation and clinical use hinder widespread
adoption. During PET imaging, the sinogram represents a form of raw data
acquired by the scanner. Therefore, modeling in projection domain enables more
direct utilization of the original information, potentially reducing the
accumulation of errors introduced during the image reconstruction process.
Inspired by these factors, this study proposes a prior-guided joint diffusion
model (PJDM) for transforming 18F-FDG PET images into 18F-DOPA PET images in
projection domain. Specifically, a coarse estimation model and a prior
refinement model are trained independently. During inference, an initial
synthetic 18F-DOPA PET sinogram is generated using a higher-order hybrid
sampler. This sinogram is then degraded and serves as an additional condition
to guide the iterative refinement process using learned prior. Experimental
results demonstrated that PJDM effectively improved both sinogram quality and
synthetic outcomes. The code is available at: https://github.com/yqx7150/PJDM.

Abstract: Infrared thermography faces persistent challenges in temperature accuracy due
to material emissivity variations, where existing methods often neglect the
joint optimization of radiometric calibration and image degradation. This study
introduces a physically guided neural framework that unifies temperature
correction and image enhancement through a symmetric skip-CNN architecture and
an emissivity-aware attention module. The pre-processing stage segments the
ROIs of the image and and initially corrected the firing rate. A novel
dual-constrained loss function strengthens the statistical consistency between
the target and reference regions through mean-variance alignment and histogram
matching based on Kullback-Leibler dispersion. The method works by dynamically
fusing thermal radiation features and spatial context, and the model suppresses
emissivity artifacts while recovering structural details. After validating the
industrial blower system under different conditions, the improved network
realizes the dynamic fusion of thermal radiation characteristics and spatial
background, with accurate calibration results in various industrial conditions.

Motivation: 多示踪剂PET成像能提供更全面的生理和病理信息，但由于不同示踪剂的光子对能量相同，信号难以区分，因此需要一种有效的方法进行示踪剂分离。

Method: 提出MS-CDT模型，整合扩散和变换器架构，引入纹理掩码作为条件输入，并利用多潜在空间先验捕捉多层次特征表示。

Conclusion: MS-CDT通过纹理条件和多潜在空间引导，实现了更准确和鲁棒的PET示踪剂分离，为多示踪剂成像提供了新思路。

Abstract: In clinical practice, single-radiotracer positron emission tomography (PET)
is commonly used for imaging. Although multi-tracer PET imaging can provide
supplementary information of radiotracers that are sensitive to physiological
function changes, enabling a more comprehensive characterization of
physiological and pathological states, the gamma-photon pairs generated by
positron annihilation reactions of different tracers in PET imaging have the
same energy, making it difficult to distinguish the tracer signals. In this
study, a multi-latent space guided texture conditional diffusion transformer
model (MS-CDT) is proposed for PET tracer separation. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first attempt to use texture condition and multi-latent
space for tracer separation in PET imaging. The proposed model integrates
diffusion and transformer architectures into a unified optimization framework,
with the novel addition of texture masks as conditional inputs to enhance image
details. By leveraging multi-latent space prior derived from different tracers,
the model captures multi-level feature representations, aiming to balance
computational efficiency and detail preservation. The texture masks, serving as
conditional guidance, help the model focus on salient structural patterns,
thereby improving the extraction and utilization of fine-grained image
textures. When combined with the diffusion transformer backbone, this
conditioning mechanism contributes to more accurate and robust tracer
separation. To evaluate its effectiveness, the proposed MS-CDT is compared with
several advanced methods on two types of 3D PET datasets: brain and chest
scans. Experimental results indicate that MS-CDT achieved competitive
performance in terms of image quality and preservation of clinically relevant
information. Code is available at: https://github.com/yqx7150/MS-CDT.

Abstract: Deep neural networks are increasingly being used to detect and diagnose
medical conditions using medical imaging. Despite their utility, these models
are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks and distribution shifts, which can
affect diagnostic reliability and undermine trust among healthcare
professionals. In this study, we propose a robust training algorithm with data
augmentation (RTDA) to mitigate these vulnerabilities in medical image
classification. We benchmark classifier robustness against adversarial
perturbations and natural variations of RTDA and six competing baseline
techniques, including adversarial training and data augmentation approaches in
isolation and combination, using experimental data sets with three different
imaging technologies (mammograms, X-rays, and ultrasound). We demonstrate that
RTDA achieves superior robustness against adversarial attacks and improved
generalization performance in the presence of distribution shift in each image
classification task while maintaining high clean accuracy.

Conclusion: MeDi为利用生成模型减少数据偏见提供了概念验证，有望推动深度学习在临床实践中的应用。

Abstract: Deep learning models have made significant advances in histological
prediction tasks in recent years. However, for adaptation in clinical practice,
their lack of robustness to varying conditions such as staining, scanner,
hospital, and demographics is still a limiting factor: if trained on
overrepresented subpopulations, models regularly struggle with less frequent
patterns, leading to shortcut learning and biased predictions. Large-scale
foundation models have not fully eliminated this issue. Therefore, we propose a
novel approach explicitly modeling such metadata into a Metadata-guided
generative Diffusion model framework (MeDi). MeDi allows for a targeted
augmentation of underrepresented subpopulations with synthetic data, which
balances limited training data and mitigates biases in downstream models. We
experimentally show that MeDi generates high-quality histopathology images for
unseen subpopulations in TCGA, boosts the overall fidelity of the generated
images, and enables improvements in performance for downstream classifiers on
datasets with subpopulation shifts. Our work is a proof-of-concept towards
better mitigating data biases with generative models.

Result: 少量GAN数据（如100张）可提升模型性能（准确率95.2%），但过多会降低效果。

Conclusion: GAN生成数据可有效扩充有限数据集，但需谨慎控制比例以避免性能下降。

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have shown potential in expanding
limited medical imaging datasets. This study explores how different ratios of
GAN-generated and real brain tumor MRI images impact the performance of a CNN
in classifying healthy vs. tumorous scans. A DCGAN was used to create synthetic
images which were mixed with real ones at various ratios to train a custom CNN.
The CNN was then evaluated on a separate real-world test set. Our results
indicate that the model maintains high sensitivity and precision in tumor
classification, even when trained predominantly on synthetic data. When only a
small portion of GAN data was added, such as 900 real images and 100 GAN
images, the model achieved excellent performance, with test accuracy reaching
95.2%, and precision, recall, and F1-score all exceeding 95%. However, as the
proportion of GAN images increased further, performance gradually declined.
This study suggests that while GANs are useful for augmenting limited datasets
especially when real data is scarce, too much synthetic data can introduce
artifacts that affect the model's ability to generalize to real world cases.

Abstract: Unoriented surface reconstruction is an important task in computer graphics
and has extensive applications. Based on the compact support of wavelet and
orthogonality properties, classic wavelet surface reconstruction achieves good
and fast reconstruction. However, this method can only handle oriented points.
Despite some improved attempts for unoriented points, such as iWSR, these
methods perform poorly on sparse point clouds. To address these shortcomings,
we propose a wavelet-based method to represent the mollified indicator function
and complete both the orientation and surface reconstruction tasks. We use the
modifying kernel function to smoothen out discontinuities on the surface,
aligning with the continuity of the wavelet basis function. During the
calculation of coefficient, we fully utilize the properties of the
convolutional kernel function to shift the modifying computation onto wavelet
basis to accelerate. In addition, we propose a novel method for constructing
the divergence-free function field and using them to construct the additional
homogeneous constraints to improve the effectiveness and stability. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
in both orientation and reconstruction for sparse models. We align the matrix
construction with the compact support property of wavelet basis functions to
further accelerate our method, resulting in efficient performance on CPU. Our
source codes will be released on GitHub.

Result: 在扩展到1M状态和2^125观测的大规模环境中，RecBayes能有效识别团队和任务并协助完成任务。

Conclusion: RecBayes在部分可观测环境下表现优异，且适用于任意大规模空间。

Abstract: This paper proposes RecBayes, a novel approach for ad hoc teamwork under
partial observability, a setting where agents are deployed on-the-fly to
environments where pre-existing teams operate, that never requires, at any
stage, access to the states of the environment or the actions of its teammates.
We show that by relying on a recurrent Bayesian classifier trained using past
experiences, an ad hoc agent is effectively able to identify known teams and
tasks being performed from observations alone. Unlike recent approaches such as
PO-GPL (Gu et al., 2021) and FEAT (Rahman et al., 2023), that require at some
stage fully observable states of the environment, actions of teammates, or
both, or approaches such as ATPO (Ribeiro et al., 2023) that require the
environments to be small enough to be tabularly modelled (Ribeiro et al.,
2023), in their work up to 4.8K states and 1.7K observations, we show RecBayes
is both able to handle arbitrarily large spaces while never relying on either
states and teammates' actions. Our results in benchmark domains from the
multi-agent systems literature, adapted for partial observability and scaled up
to 1M states and 2^125 observations, show that RecBayes is effective at
identifying known teams and tasks being performed from partial observations
alone, and as a result, is able to assist the teams in solving the tasks
effectively.

Abstract: Adapting a single agent to a new multi-agent system brings challenges,
necessitating adjustments across various tasks, environments, and interactions
with unknown teammates and opponents. Addressing this challenge is highly
complex, and researchers have proposed two simplified scenarios, Multi-agent
reinforcement learning for zero-shot learning and Ad-Hoc Teamwork. Building on
these foundations, we propose a more comprehensive setting, Agent
Collaborative-Competitive Adaptation (ACCA), which evaluates an agent to
generalize across diverse scenarios, tasks, and interactions with both
unfamiliar opponents and teammates. In ACCA, agents adjust to task and
environmental changes, collaborate with unseen teammates, and compete against
unknown opponents. We introduce a new modeling approach, Multi-Retrieval and
Dynamic Generation (MRDG), that effectively models both teammates and opponents
using their behavioral trajectories. This method incorporates a positional
encoder for varying team sizes and a hypernetwork module to boost agents'
learning and adaptive capabilities. Additionally, a viewpoint alignment module
harmonizes the observational perspectives of retrieved teammates and opponents
with the learning agent. Extensive tests in benchmark scenarios like SMAC,
Overcooked-AI, and Melting Pot show that MRDG significantly improves robust
collaboration and competition with unseen teammates and opponents, surpassing
established baselines. Our code is available at:
