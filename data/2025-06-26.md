### [2] [Context Attribution with Multi-Armed Bandit Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19977)
*Deng Pan,Keerthiram Murugesan,Nuno Moniz,Nitesh Chawla*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于组合多臂老虎机（CMAB）的框架，用于高效识别检索上下文对生成答案的贡献，显著提升了查询效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了提高生成式问答系统的可解释性和可信度，需要明确检索上下文中哪些部分对模型生成的答案有贡献。

Method: 将上下文归因问题建模为组合多臂老虎机问题，使用组合汤普森采样（CTS）在有限查询预算下高效探索上下文子集。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在减少模型查询次数的同时，保持了较高的归因质量。

Conclusion: 该方法在高效性和归因质量上优于传统的扰动归因方法，适用于多种数据集和大型语言模型。

Abstract: Understanding which parts of the retrieved context contribute to a large
language model's generated answer is essential for building interpretable and
trustworthy generative QA systems. We propose a novel framework that formulates
context attribution as a combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB) problem. Each
context segment is treated as a bandit arm, and we employ Combinatorial
Thompson Sampling (CTS) to efficiently explore the exponentially large space of
context subsets under a limited query budget. Our method defines a reward
function based on normalized token likelihoods, capturing how well a subset of
segments supports the original model response. Unlike traditional
perturbation-based attribution methods such as SHAP, which sample subsets
uniformly and incur high computational costs, our approach adaptively balances
exploration and exploitation by leveraging posterior estimates of segment
relevance. This leads to substantially improved query efficiency while
maintaining high attribution fidelity. Extensive experiments on diverse
datasets and LLMs demonstrate that our method achieves competitive attribution
quality with fewer model queries.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong
potential in code generation, yet their effectiveness in quantum computing
remains underexplored. This paper benchmarks LLMs for PennyLane-based quantum
code generation using real-world challenges from the Quantum Hackathon (QHack).
We introduce QHackBench, a novel benchmark dataset derived from QHack
competitions, and evaluate model performance under vanilla prompting and
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Our structured evaluation framework
assesses functional correctness, syntactic validity, and execution success
across varying challenge difficulties. Results indicate that RAG-enhanced
models, supplemented with an augmented PennyLane dataset, approximately
generate similar results as the standard prompting, particularly in complex
quantum algorithms. Additionally, we introduce a multi-agent evaluation
pipeline that iteratively refines incorrect solutions, further enhancing
execution success rates. To foster further research, we commit to publicly
releasing QHackBench, along with our evaluation framework and experimental
results, enabling continued advancements in AI-assisted quantum programming.

### [4] [Accurate and Energy Efficient: Local Retrieval-Augmented Generation Models Outperform Commercial Large Language Models in Medical Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20009)
*Konstantinos Vrettos,Michail E. Klontzas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究开发了一种可定制的RAG框架，用于医疗任务，其性能和能耗优于商业LLM，同时减少环境影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI在医疗领域的应用对环境与伦理的影响，尤其是商业LLM的高资源消耗与隐私安全问题。

Method: 开发了可监控能耗的RAG框架，基于开源LLM构建RAG模型，并与商业模型对比。

Result: 基于llama3.1:8B的RAG模型在准确性和能耗上均优于商业模型，能耗更低且CO2排放更少。

Conclusion: 本地LLM构建的RAG在医疗任务中表现更优且环保，符合可持续发展目标。

Abstract: Background The increasing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in
healthcare has sparked growing concerns about its environmental and ethical
implications. Commercial Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and
DeepSeek, require substantial resources, while the utilization of these systems
for medical purposes raises critical issues regarding patient privacy and
safety. Methods We developed a customizable Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) framework for medical tasks, which monitors its energy usage and CO2
emissions. This system was then used to create RAGs based on various
open-source LLMs. The tested models included both general purpose models like
llama3.1:8b and medgemma-4b-it, which is medical-domain specific. The best RAGs
performance and energy consumption was compared to DeepSeekV3-R1 and OpenAIs
o4-mini model. A dataset of medical questions was used for the evaluation.
Results Custom RAG models outperformed commercial models in accuracy and energy
consumption. The RAG model built on llama3.1:8B achieved the highest accuracy
(58.5%) and was significantly better than other models, including o4-mini and
DeepSeekV3-R1. The llama3.1-RAG also exhibited the lowest energy consumption
and CO2 footprint among all models, with a Performance per kWh of 0.52 and a
total CO2 emission of 473g. Compared to o4-mini, the llama3.1-RAG achieved 2.7x
times more accuracy points per kWh and 172% less electricity usage while
maintaining higher accuracy. Conclusion Our study demonstrates that local LLMs
can be leveraged to develop RAGs that outperform commercial, online LLMs in
medical tasks, while having a smaller environmental impact. Our modular
framework promotes sustainable AI development, reducing electricity usage and
aligning with the UNs Sustainable Development Goals.

### [6] [Persona-Assigned Large Language Models Exhibit Human-Like Motivated Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20020)
*Saloni Dash,Amélie Reymond,Emma S. Spiro,Aylin Caliskan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现，大型语言模型（LLMs）在分配特定身份后，会表现出类似人类的动机性推理，导致判断偏差，且难以通过提示去偏。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs是否因身份分配而表现出动机性推理，类似人类的认知偏差，及其对社会议题的影响。

Method: 为8种LLMs分配8种政治和社会人口属性身份，测试其在信息真实性辨别和科学证据评估任务中的表现。

Result: 身份分配的LLMs在真实性辨别上降低9%，政治身份模型在符合其身份的科学证据评估中正确率提高90%。提示去偏方法效果有限。

Conclusion: LLMs表现出类似人类的动机性推理，可能加剧身份一致性推理，需关注其对社会的影响。

Abstract: Reasoning in humans is prone to biases due to underlying motivations like
identity protection, that undermine rational decision-making and judgment. This
motivated reasoning at a collective level can be detrimental to society when
debating critical issues such as human-driven climate change or vaccine safety,
and can further aggravate political polarization. Prior studies have reported
that large language models (LLMs) are also susceptible to human-like cognitive
biases, however, the extent to which LLMs selectively reason toward
identity-congruent conclusions remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigate
whether assigning 8 personas across 4 political and socio-demographic
attributes induces motivated reasoning in LLMs. Testing 8 LLMs (open source and
proprietary) across two reasoning tasks from human-subject studies -- veracity
discernment of misinformation headlines and evaluation of numeric scientific
evidence -- we find that persona-assigned LLMs have up to 9% reduced veracity
discernment relative to models without personas. Political personas
specifically, are up to 90% more likely to correctly evaluate scientific
evidence on gun control when the ground truth is congruent with their induced
political identity. Prompt-based debiasing methods are largely ineffective at
mitigating these effects. Taken together, our empirical findings are the first
to suggest that persona-assigned LLMs exhibit human-like motivated reasoning
that is hard to mitigate through conventional debiasing prompts -- raising
concerns of exacerbating identity-congruent reasoning in both LLMs and humans.

### [7] [DiaLLMs: EHR Enhanced Clinical Conversational System for Clinical Test Recommendation and Diagnosis Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20059)
*Weijieying Ren,Tianxiang Zhao,Lei Wang,Tianchun Wang,Vasant Honavar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DiaLLM是一种整合电子健康记录（EHR）的医疗大语言模型，通过临床测试参考策略和强化学习框架，提升临床测试推荐和诊断预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医疗大语言模型忽视EHR的作用，且仅关注诊断推荐，限制了临床应用。DiaLLM旨在通过整合EHR数据，更贴近实际医疗实践。

Method: 采用临床测试参考（CTR）策略将临床代码映射为描述并分类测试结果；使用强化学习框架进行证据获取和自动诊断；引入拒绝采样策略和奖励机制优化性能。

Result: 实验表明，DiaLLM在临床测试推荐和诊断预测上优于基线模型。

Conclusion: DiaLLM通过整合EHR和优化学习策略，显著提升了医疗对话模型的临床适用性。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to remarkable
progresses in medical consultation. However, existing medical LLMs overlook the
essential role of Electronic Health Records (EHR) and focus primarily on
diagnosis recommendation, limiting their clinical applicability. We propose
DiaLLM, the first medical LLM that integrates heterogeneous EHR data into
clinically grounded dialogues, enabling clinical test recommendation, result
interpretation, and diagnosis prediction to better align with real-world
medical practice. To construct clinically grounded dialogues from EHR, we
design a Clinical Test Reference (CTR) strategy that maps each clinical code to
its corresponding description and classifies test results as "normal" or
"abnormal". Additionally, DiaLLM employs a reinforcement learning framework for
evidence acquisition and automated diagnosis. To handle the large action space,
we introduce a reject sampling strategy to reduce redundancy and improve
exploration efficiency. Furthermore, a confirmation reward and a
class-sensitive diagnosis reward are designed to guide accurate diagnosis
prediction. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DiaLLM outperforms
baselines in clinical test recommendation and diagnosis prediction.

### [8] [AI Copilots for Reproducibility in Science: A Case Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20130)
*Adrien Bibal,Steven N. Minton,Deborah Khider,Yolanda Gil*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OpenPub是一个AI驱动的平台，通过模块化助手支持开放科学任务，特别是可重复性助手，显著减少复制时间并提高研究透明度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放科学倡议旨在提高研究的透明度和可重复性，但独立复制研究成果仍具挑战性。

Method: OpenPub平台的可重复性助手分析论文、代码和补充材料，生成结构化Jupyter Notebook和建议，以促进计算可重复性。

Result: 测试显示，OpenPub将复制时间从30多小时缩短至约1小时，并高覆盖率地复制图表和结果。

Conclusion: AI工具能有效减轻可重复性负担，提升科学交流的透明度和可验证性，其模块化架构支持扩展到其他开放科学目标。

Abstract: Open science initiatives seek to make research outputs more transparent,
accessible, and reusable, but ensuring that published findings can be
independently reproduced remains a persistent challenge. This paper introduces
OpenPub, an AI-powered platform that supports researchers, reviewers, and
readers through a suite of modular copilots focused on key open science tasks.
In this work, we present the Reproducibility Copilot, which analyzes
manuscripts, code, and supplementary materials to generate structured Jupyter
Notebooks and recommendations aimed at facilitating computational, or "rote",
reproducibility. We conducted feasibility tests using previously studied
research papers with known reproducibility benchmarks. Results indicate that
OpenPub can substantially reduce reproduction time - from over 30 hours to
about 1 hour - while achieving high coverage of figures, tables, and results
suitable for computational reproduction. The system systematically detects
barriers to reproducibility, including missing hyperparameters, undocumented
preprocessing steps, and incomplete or inaccessible datasets. These findings
suggest that AI-driven tools can meaningfully reduce the burden of
reproducibility efforts and contribute to more transparent and verifiable
scientific communication. The modular copilot architecture also provides a
foundation for extending AI assistance to additional open science objectives
beyond reproducibility.

*Junyan Cheng,Peter Clark,Kyle Richardson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 利用多智能体LLM方法Genesys，通过遗传编程骨架高效发现新型语言模型架构，实验验证了1,162种设计，其中最佳设计在多个基准测试中优于已知架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索是否可以利用LLM模拟发现新型语言模型架构的研究过程，以提高设计效率和性能。

Method: 采用多智能体LLM方法Genesys，结合阶梯式规模扩展和遗传编程骨架，从提案到验证全流程模拟研究过程。

Result: 实验生成1,162种新设计，其中1,062种通过预训练验证，最佳设计在6/9基准测试中优于GPT2和Mamba2等。

Conclusion: Genesys系统展示了高效自主发现语言模型架构的潜力，为未来自动化研究系统设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Can we leverage LLMs to model the process of discovering novel language model
(LM) architectures? Inspired by real research, we propose a multi-agent LLM
approach that simulates the conventional stages of research, from ideation and
literature search (proposal stage) to design implementation (code generation),
generative pre-training, and downstream evaluation (verification). Using ideas
from scaling laws, our system, Genesys, employs a Ladder of Scales approach;
new designs are proposed, adversarially reviewed, implemented, and selectively
verified at increasingly larger model scales (14M$\sim$350M parameters) with a
narrowing budget (the number of models we can train at each scale). To help
make discovery efficient and factorizable, Genesys uses a novel genetic
programming backbone, which we show has empirical advantages over commonly used
direct prompt generation workflows (e.g., $\sim$86\% percentage point
improvement in successful design generation, a key bottleneck). We report
experiments involving 1,162 newly discovered designs (1,062 fully verified
through pre-training) and find the best designs to be highly competitive with
known architectures (e.g., outperform GPT2, Mamba2, etc., on 6/9 common
benchmarks). We couple these results with comprehensive system-level ablations
and formal results, which give broader insights into the design of effective
autonomous discovery systems.

*Liya Wang,David Yi,Damien Jose,John Passarelli,James Gao,Jordan Leventis,Kang Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一个基于Bloom分类法的14任务框架，用于全面评估大语言模型在企业环境中的能力，并开发了一个可扩展的数据标注和评估流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试（如MMLU）无法充分评估企业特定任务的复杂性，需要更全面的评估方法。

Method: 结合LLM-as-a-Labeler、LLM-as-a-Judge和CRAG技术，构建了一个9,700样本的基准测试。

Result: 开源模型（如DeepSeek R1）在推理任务中表现接近专有模型，但在判断任务中表现较差，可能因过度思考。

Conclusion: 该研究为企业提供了定制化评估的蓝图，并推动了LLM的实际部署。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) ) have demonstrated promise in boosting
productivity across AI-powered tools, yet existing benchmarks like Massive
Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) inadequately assess enterprise-specific
task complexities. We propose a 14-task framework grounded in Bloom's Taxonomy
to holistically evaluate LLM capabilities in enterprise contexts. To address
challenges of noisy data and costly annotation, we develop a scalable pipeline
combining LLM-as-a-Labeler, LLM-as-a-Judge, and corrective retrieval-augmented
generation (CRAG), curating a robust 9,700-sample benchmark. Evaluation of six
leading models shows open-source contenders like DeepSeek R1 rival proprietary
models in reasoning tasks but lag in judgment-based scenarios, likely due to
overthinking. Our benchmark reveals critical enterprise performance gaps and
offers actionable insights for model optimization. This work provides
enterprises a blueprint for tailored evaluations and advances practical LLM
deployment.

### [11] [Mobile-R1: Towards Interactive Reinforcement Learning for VLM-Based Mobile Agent via Task-Level Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20332)
*Jihao Gu,Qihang Ai,Yingyao Wang,Pi Bu,Jingxuan Xing,Zekun Zhu,Wei Jiang,Ziming Wang,Yingxiu Zhao,Ming-Liang Zhang,Jun Song,Yuning Jiang,Bo Zheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出Mobile-R1方法，通过多轮交互式强化学习与任务级奖励，提升移动代理的探索和纠错能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要基于离线强化学习或动作级奖励的在线优化，限制了代理与环境的动态交互，导致局部最优和探索能力不足。

Method: 采用三阶段训练框架：初始微调、动作级奖励的单步在线训练、基于多轮轨迹的任务级奖励在线训练。

Result: 显著提升了代理的性能，并发布了包含28个中国应用的24,521条标注数据和500条轨迹的基准。

Conclusion: Mobile-R1通过任务级奖励和多轮交互强化学习，有效解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Vision-language model-based mobile agents have gained the ability to not only
understand complex instructions and mobile screenshots, but also optimize their
action outputs via thinking and reasoning, benefiting from reinforcement
learning, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). However, existing
research centers on offline reinforcement learning training or online
optimization using action-level rewards, which limits the agent's dynamic
interaction with the environment. This often results in agents settling into
local optima, thereby weakening their ability for exploration and error action
correction. To address these challenges, we introduce an approach called
Mobile-R1, which employs interactive multi-turn reinforcement learning with
task-level rewards for mobile agents. Our training framework consists of three
stages: initial format finetuning, single-step online training via action-level
reward, followed by online training via task-level reward based on multi-turn
trajectories. This strategy is designed to enhance the exploration and error
correction capabilities of Mobile-R1, leading to significant performance
improvements. Moreover, we have collected a dataset covering 28 Chinese
applications with 24,521 high-quality manual annotations and established a new
benchmark with 500 trajectories. We will open source all resources, including
the dataset, benchmark, model weight, and codes:

*Sungwon Han,Sungkyu Park,Seungeon Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为REFeat的新方法，通过引导大型语言模型（LLM）利用多种推理类型生成多样且信息丰富的特征，解决了现有LLM方法生成特征过于简单或重复的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的特征生成方法存在生成特征过于简单或重复的问题，部分原因是LLM选择的转换存在固有偏见以及生成过程中缺乏结构化推理指导。

Method: 提出REFeat方法，通过多种推理类型引导LLM生成多样且信息丰富的特征。

Result: 在59个基准数据集上的实验表明，REFeat不仅平均预测准确率更高，还能发现更多样且有意义的特征。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，将丰富的推理范式和自适应策略选择融入LLM驱动的特征发现中具有广阔前景。

Abstract: Feature engineering for tabular data remains a critical yet challenging step
in machine learning. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been used to
automatically generate new features by leveraging their vast knowledge.
However, existing LLM-based approaches often produce overly simple or
repetitive features, partly due to inherent biases in the transformations the
LLM chooses and the lack of structured reasoning guidance during generation. In
this paper, we propose a novel method REFeat, which guides an LLM to discover
diverse and informative features by leveraging multiple types of reasoning to
steer the feature generation process. Experiments on 59 benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our approach not only achieves higher predictive accuracy on
average, but also discovers more diverse and meaningful features. These results
highlight the promise of incorporating rich reasoning paradigms and adaptive
strategy selection into LLM-driven feature discovery for tabular data.

in the document. We will introduce Paladin-mini, a compact (3.8B parameters)
open-source classifier model (used for labeling data as grounded or ungrounded)
engineered for robust performance in real-world scenarios, and the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着电动汽车（EVs）的普及，如何在服务系统中优化其充电和放电行为以提升利润成为关键问题。V2G技术为EVs提供了新的盈利机会，但也增加了复杂性。

Method: 采用混合整数规划（MIP）模型，并提出两种元启发式算法：进化算法（EA）和大邻域搜索（LNS）。

Result: 在真实数据实验中，所提方法使司机利润翻倍，并在小规模实例中接近最优，大规模实例中表现出色。

Conclusion: 研究为智能、高利润的电动汽车移动系统提供了可行路径，同时支持电网能源管理。

Abstract: With the rising popularity of electric vehicles (EVs), modern service
systems, such as ride-hailing delivery services, are increasingly integrating
EVs into their operations. Unlike conventional vehicles, EVs often have a
shorter driving range, necessitating careful consideration of charging when
fulfilling requests. With recent advances in Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology -
allowing EVs to also discharge energy back to the grid - new opportunities and
complexities emerge. We introduce the Electric Vehicle Orienteering Problem
with V2G (EVOP-V2G): a profit-maximization problem where EV drivers must select
customer requests or orders while managing when and where to charge or
discharge. This involves navigating dynamic electricity prices, charging
station selection, and route constraints. We formulate the problem as a Mixed
Integer Programming (MIP) model and propose two near-optimal metaheuristic
algorithms: one evolutionary (EA) and the other based on large neighborhood
search (LNS). Experiments on real-world data show our methods can double driver
profits compared to baselines, while maintaining near-optimal performance on
small instances and excellent scalability on larger ones. Our work highlights a
promising path toward smarter, more profitable EV-based mobility systems that
actively support the energy grid.

*Riccardo Lo Bianco,Willem van Jaarsveld,Remco Dijkman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GymPN是一个基于深度强化学习的软件库，用于优化业务流程中的决策，支持部分流程可观测性和多决策建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决业务流程中任务分配决策的局限性，支持更现实的流程决策。

Method: 利用深度强化学习，引入部分流程可观测性和多决策建模。

Result: 在八种典型业务流程决策问题模式上验证了GymPN的有效性。

Conclusion: GymPN能够轻松建模问题并学习最优决策策略。

Abstract: Process management systems support key decisions about the way work is
allocated in organizations. This includes decisions on which task to perform
next, when to execute the task, and who to assign the task to. Suitable
software tools are required to support these decisions in a way that is optimal
for the organization. This paper presents a software library, called GymPN,
that supports optimal decision-making in business processes using Deep
Reinforcement Learning. GymPN builds on previous work that supports task
assignment in business processes, introducing two key novelties: support for
partial process observability and the ability to model multiple decisions in a
business process. These novel elements address fundamental limitations of
previous work and thus enable the representation of more realistic process

decision-making problem patterns, showing that GymPN allows for easy modeling
of the desired problems, as well as learning optimal decision policies.

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合神经细胞自动机（MNCA）框架，结合概率规则和内在噪声，以更好地模拟生物系统的随机性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经细胞自动机（NCA）的确定性限制了其对真实生物系统随机性的建模能力。

Method: 将混合模型思想引入NCA，结合概率规则和内在噪声，提出MNCA框架。

Result: 在组织生长模拟、图像形态生成和显微镜图像分割中，MNCA表现出更强的鲁棒性、更真实的生物生长模式和可解释的规则分割。

Conclusion: MNCA是模拟随机动态系统和研究自生长过程的有力工具。

Abstract: Neural Cellular Automata (NCAs) are a promising new approach to model
self-organizing processes, with potential applications in life science.
However, their deterministic nature limits their ability to capture the
stochasticity of real-world biological and physical systems.
  We propose the Mixture of Neural Cellular Automata (MNCA), a novel framework
incorporating the idea of mixture models into the NCA paradigm. By combining
probabilistic rule assignments with intrinsic noise, MNCAs can model diverse
local behaviors and reproduce the stochastic dynamics observed in biological
processes.
  We evaluate the effectiveness of MNCAs in three key domains: (1) synthetic
simulations of tissue growth and differentiation, (2) image morphogenesis
robustness, and (3) microscopy image segmentation. Results show that MNCAs
achieve superior robustness to perturbations, better recapitulate real
biological growth patterns, and provide interpretable rule segmentation. These
findings position MNCAs as a promising tool for modeling stochastic dynamical
systems and studying self-growth processes.

Result: 明确了功能性感知的定义及其在AI中的潜在实现路径。

Conclusion: 理解人工代理的功能性感知有助于避免无意中创造或及时发现其存在。

Abstract: We spell out a definition of sentience that may be useful for designing and
building it in machines. We propose that for sentience to be meaningful for AI,
it must be fleshed out in functional, computational terms, in enough detail to
allow for implementation. Yet, this notion of sentience must also reflect
something essentially 'subjective', beyond just having the general capacity to
encode perceptual content. For this specific functional notion of sentience to
occur, we propose that certain sensory signals need to be both assertoric
(persistent) and qualitative. To illustrate the definition in more concrete
terms, we sketch out some ways for potential implementation, given current
technology. Understanding what it takes for artificial agents to be
functionally sentient can also help us avoid creating them inadvertently, or at
least, realize that we have created them in a timely manner.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于案例推理增强的大语言模型（CBR-LLM）框架，用于复杂风险场景下的避障决策，结合语义场景理解和历史驾驶案例检索，提升决策准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型（LLMs）在自动驾驶领域的直接应用存在领域适应、上下文理解和经验知识不足的挑战，需要一种更可靠和可解释的决策支持工具。

Method: 提出CBR-LLM框架，通过语义场景理解和历史驾驶案例检索，结合风险感知提示策略，增强LLMs的决策能力。

Result: 实验表明，该框架提高了决策准确性、解释质量，并与人类专家行为更一致；案例检索优于随机采样。

Conclusion: CBR-LLM框架在复杂风险场景中表现出鲁棒性和适应性，有望成为智能驾驶系统的可信决策支持工具。

Abstract: Driving in safety-critical scenarios requires quick, context-aware
decision-making grounded in both situational understanding and experiential
reasoning. Large Language Models (LLMs), with their powerful general-purpose
reasoning capabilities, offer a promising foundation for such decision-making.
However, their direct application to autonomous driving remains limited due to
challenges in domain adaptation, contextual grounding, and the lack of
experiential knowledge needed to make reliable and interpretable decisions in
dynamic, high-risk environments. To address this gap, this paper presents a
Case-Based Reasoning Augmented Large Language Model (CBR-LLM) framework for
evasive maneuver decision-making in complex risk scenarios. Our approach
integrates semantic scene understanding from dashcam video inputs with the
retrieval of relevant past driving cases, enabling LLMs to generate maneuver
recommendations that are both context-sensitive and human-aligned. Experiments
across multiple open-source LLMs show that our framework improves decision
accuracy, justification quality, and alignment with human expert behavior.
Risk-aware prompting strategies further enhance performance across diverse risk
types, while similarity-based case retrieval consistently outperforms random
sampling in guiding in-context learning. Case studies further demonstrate the
framework's robustness in challenging real-world conditions, underscoring its
potential as an adaptive and trustworthy decision-support tool for intelligent
driving systems.

Motivation: 全球对可持续蛋白质的需求推动了智能工具的开发，以快速处理和合成领域特定的科学知识。

Method: 采用基于GPT的LLM代理，包括文献搜索代理和信息提取代理，探索微调和提示工程两种优化方法。

Result: 微调和提示工程均有效提升信息提取性能，微调效果更优（平均余弦相似度≥0.94），提示工程统计不确定性更低。

Conclusion: 多代理AI框架在可持续蛋白质研究中表现出潜力，未来可扩展化学安全搜索功能。

Abstract: The global demand for sustainable protein sources has accelerated the need
for intelligent tools that can rapidly process and synthesise domain-specific
scientific knowledge. In this study, we present a proof-of-concept multi-agent
Artificial Intelligence (AI) framework designed to support sustainable protein
production research, with an initial focus on microbial protein sources. Our
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-oriented system consists of two GPT-based
LLM agents: (1) a literature search agent that retrieves relevant scientific
literature on microbial protein production for a specified microbial strain,
and (2) an information extraction agent that processes the retrieved content to
extract relevant biological and chemical information. Two parallel
methodologies, fine-tuning and prompt engineering, were explored for agent
optimisation. Both methods demonstrated effectiveness at improving the
performance of the information extraction agent in terms of transformer-based
cosine similarity scores between obtained and ideal outputs. Mean cosine
similarity scores were increased by up to 25%, while universally reaching mean
scores of $\geq 0.89$ against ideal output text. Fine-tuning overall improved
the mean scores to a greater extent (consistently of $\geq 0.94$) compared to
prompt engineering, although lower statistical uncertainties were observed with
the latter approach. A user interface was developed and published for enabling
the use of the multi-agent AI system, alongside preliminary exploration of
additional chemical safety-based search capabilities

Result: 初步构建了知识中心的AI框架，专注于可扩展Krylov求解器，提升了开发和使用效率。

Conclusion: 目标是扩展为强大的知识平台，加速科学发现，未来将进一步优化系统。

Abstract: Generative AI, especially through large language models (LLMs), is
transforming how technical knowledge can be accessed, reused, and extended.
PETSc, a widely used numerical library for high-performance scientific
computing, has accumulated a rich but fragmented knowledge base over its three
decades of development, spanning source code, documentation, mailing lists,
GitLab issues, Discord conversations, technical papers, and more. Much of this
knowledge remains informal and inaccessible to users and new developers. To
activate and utilize this knowledge base more effectively, the PETSc team has
begun building an LLM-powered system that combines PETSc content with custom
LLM tools -- including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), reranking
algorithms, and chatbots -- to assist users, support developers, and propose
updates to formal documentation. This paper presents initial experiences
designing and evaluating these tools, focusing on system architecture, using
RAG and reranking for PETSc-specific information, evaluation methodologies for
various LLMs and embedding models, and user interface design. Leveraging the
Argonne Leadership Computing Facility resources, we analyze how LLM responses
can enhance the development and use of numerical software, with an initial
focus on scalable Krylov solvers. Our goal is to establish an extensible
framework for knowledge-centered AI in scientific software, enabling scalable
support, enriched documentation, and enhanced workflows for research and
development. We conclude by outlining directions for expanding this system into
a robust, evolving platform that advances software ecosystems to accelerate
scientific discovery.

Abstract: Large language model-based machine learning (ML) agents have shown great
promise in automating ML research. However, existing agents typically operate
in isolation on a given research problem, without engaging with the broader
research community, where human researchers often gain insights and contribute
by sharing knowledge. To bridge this gap, we introduce MLE-Live, a live
evaluation framework designed to assess an agent's ability to communicate with
and leverage collective knowledge from a simulated Kaggle research community.
Building on this framework, we propose CoMind, a novel agent that excels at
exchanging insights and developing novel solutions within a community context.
CoMind achieves state-of-the-art performance on MLE-Live and outperforms 79.2%
human competitors on average across four ongoing Kaggle competitions. Our code

TL;DR: Decrypto是一个基于游戏的基准测试，用于评估大语言模型在多智能体推理和心理理论（ToM）方面的能力，填补了现有基准测试的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLMs）具备代理能力，它们需要在复杂的多智能体场景中与人类和其他智能体互动，但目前对LLMs在多智能体能力和心理理论方面的理解不足，现有基准测试存在范围狭窄、数据泄露等问题。

Method: 提出Decrypto基准测试，结合认知科学、计算语用学和多智能体强化学习，设计交互式心理理论实验平台。

Result: 实证评估显示，LLMs的游戏能力落后于人类和简单词嵌入基线模型，且最新推理模型在经典心理理论任务中表现不如旧模型。

Conclusion: Decrypto填补了当前推理和心理理论评估的关键空白，为开发更优的人工智能代理铺平了道路。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) gain agentic abilities, they will have to
navigate complex multi-agent scenarios, interacting with human users and other
agents in cooperative and competitive settings. This will require new reasoning
skills, chief amongst them being theory of mind (ToM), or the ability to reason
about the "mental" states of other agents. However, ToM and other multi-agent
abilities in LLMs are poorly understood, since existing benchmarks suffer from
narrow scope, data leakage, saturation, and lack of interactivity. We thus
propose Decrypto, a game-based benchmark for multi-agent reasoning and ToM
drawing inspiration from cognitive science, computational pragmatics and
multi-agent reinforcement learning. It is designed to be as easy as possible in
all other dimensions, eliminating confounding factors commonly found in other
benchmarks. To our knowledge, it is also the first platform for designing
interactive ToM experiments.
  We validate the benchmark design through comprehensive empirical evaluations
of frontier LLMs, robustness studies, and human-AI cross-play experiments. We
find that LLM game-playing abilities lag behind humans and simple
word-embedding baselines. We then create variants of two classic cognitive
science experiments within Decrypto to evaluate three key ToM abilities.
Surprisingly, we find that state-of-the-art reasoning models are significantly
worse at those tasks than their older counterparts. This demonstrates that
Decrypto addresses a crucial gap in current reasoning and ToM evaluations, and
paves the path towards better artificial agents.

TL;DR: CycleDistill利用LLMs和少量示例生成合成平行语料库，通过迭代优化提升低资源语言的机器翻译质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言因缺乏平行语料库而难以实现高质量机器翻译的问题。

Method: 提出CycleDistill方法，通过零样本或少样本翻译生成合成平行语料库，并迭代优化模型。

Result: 在三种印度语言上，首轮迭代即可显著提升翻译质量（20-30 chrF点）。

Conclusion: CycleDistill在无需大量平行语料的情况下，显著提升了低资源语言的机器翻译性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), despite their ability to perform few-shot
machine translation (MT), often lag behind dedicated MT systems trained on
parallel corpora, which are crucial for high quality machine translation (MT).
However, parallel corpora are often scarce or non-existent for low-resource
languages. In this paper, we propose CycleDistill, a bootstrapping approach
leveraging LLMs and few-shot translation to obtain high-quality MT systems.
CycleDistill involves iteratively generating synthetic parallel corpora from
monolingual corpora via zero- or few-shot MT, which is then used to fine-tune
the model that was used for generating said data for MT. CycleDistill does not
need parallel corpora beyond 1 to 4 few-shot examples, and in our experiments
focusing on three Indian languages, by relying solely on monolingual corpora,
it can achieve high-quality machine translation, improving upon a few-shot
baseline model by over 20-30 chrF points on average in the first iteration. We
also study the effect of leveraging softmax activations during the distillation
process and observe mild improvements in translation quality.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Inference-Scaled GraphRAG的新框架，通过推理时计算扩展提升LLM在图推理任务中的表现，显著提高了多跳问答性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在知识密集型推理任务中表现不佳，主要因为缺乏对结构化上下文和多跳信息的访问。现有的检索增强生成（RAG）方法未能充分捕捉知识图谱中节点间的关系结构。

Method: 结合顺序扩展（深度链式思维图遍历）和并行扩展（多数投票采样轨迹），在交替推理-执行循环中实现推理时计算扩展。

Result: 在GRBench基准测试中，该方法显著优于传统GraphRAG和基线方法，提升了多跳问答性能。

Conclusion: 推理时扩展是一种实用且与架构无关的解决方案，适用于LLM的结构化知识推理。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive capabilities in
language understanding and generation, yet they continue to underperform on
knowledge-intensive reasoning tasks due to limited access to structured context
and multi-hop information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) partially
mitigates this by grounding generation in retrieved context, but conventional
RAG and GraphRAG methods often fail to capture relational structure across
nodes in knowledge graphs. We introduce Inference-Scaled GraphRAG, a novel
framework that enhances LLM-based graph reasoning by applying inference-time
compute scaling. Our method combines sequential scaling with deep
chain-of-thought graph traversal, and parallel scaling with majority voting
over sampled trajectories within an interleaved reasoning-execution loop.
Experiments on the GRBench benchmark demonstrate that our approach
significantly improves multi-hop question answering performance, achieving
substantial gains over both traditional GraphRAG and prior graph traversal
baselines. These findings suggest that inference-time scaling is a practical
and architecture-agnostic solution for structured knowledge reasoning with LLMs

Result: 在WebArena基准测试中，性能提升55%，成本降低90%；在糖材料科学领域验证了适应性。

Conclusion: Doc2Agent为从非结构化API文档构建工具代理提供了通用解决方案。

Abstract: REST APIs play important roles in enriching the action space of web agents,
yet most API-based agents rely on curated and uniform toolsets that do not
reflect the complexity of real-world APIs. Building tool-using agents for
arbitrary domains remains a major challenge, as it requires reading
unstructured API documentation, testing APIs and inferring correct parameters.
We propose Doc2Agent, a scalable pipeline to build agents that can call
Python-based tools generated from API documentation. Doc2Agent generates
executable tools from API documentations and iteratively refines them using a
code agent. We evaluate our approach on real-world APIs, WebArena APIs, and
research APIs, producing validated tools. We achieved a 55\% relative
performance improvement with 90\% lower cost compared to direct API calling on
WebArena benchmark. A domain-specific agent built for glycomaterial science
further demonstrates the pipeline's adaptability to complex, knowledge-rich
tasks. Doc2Agent offers a generalizable solution for building tool agents from
unstructured API documentation at scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时空数据挖掘模型局限于单一任务，缺乏多任务推理和深度解释能力，限制了实际应用。

Method: STReason利用上下文学习将复杂查询分解为模块化程序，生成解决方案和详细解释，无需任务特定微调。

Result: 实验表明STReason在所有指标上显著优于先进基线，尤其在复杂推理场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: STReason为开发更通用、强大的时空推理系统提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal data mining plays a pivotal role in informed decision making
across diverse domains. However, existing models are often restricted to narrow
tasks, lacking the capacity for multi-task inference and complex long-form
reasoning that require generation of in-depth, explanatory outputs. These
limitations restrict their applicability to real-world, multi-faceted decision
scenarios. In this work, we introduce STReason, a novel framework that
integrates the reasoning strengths of large language models (LLMs) with the
analytical capabilities of spatio-temporal models for multi-task inference and
execution. Without requiring task-specific finetuning, STReason leverages
in-context learning to decompose complex natural language queries into modular,
interpretable programs, which are then systematically executed to generate both
solutions and detailed rationales. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we
construct a new benchmark dataset and propose a unified evaluation framework
with metrics specifically designed for long-form spatio-temporal reasoning.
Experimental results show that STReason significantly outperforms advanced LLM
baselines across all metrics, particularly excelling in complex,
reasoning-intensive spatio-temporal scenarios. Human evaluations further
validate STReason's credibility and practical utility, demonstrating its
potential to reduce expert workload and broaden the applicability to real-world
spatio-temporal tasks. We believe STReason provides a promising direction for
developing more capable and generalizable spatio-temporal reasoning systems.

Motivation: 现有代码检索器过度依赖表面文本特征（如文档字符串、标识符名称），且对文档化代码有强烈偏见，即使文档无关。

Method: 通过系统性地屏蔽特定特征但保留代码功能，分析代码检索，并提出SACL框架，增强文本信息并减少偏见。

Result: SACL显著提升代码检索性能（如HumanEval上Recall@1提高12.8%），并改善代码生成（如HumanEval上Pass@1提高4.88%）。

Conclusion: SACL通过结合语义信息，有效解决了现有检索器的局限性，提升了代码生成的整体性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation (RACG) is a critical technique for
enhancing code generation by retrieving relevant information. In this work, we
conduct an in-depth analysis of code retrieval by systematically masking
specific features while preserving code functionality. Our discoveries include:
(1) although trained on code, current retrievers heavily rely on surface-level
textual features (e.g., docstrings, identifier names), and (2) they exhibit a
strong bias towards well-documented code, even if the documentation is
irrelevant.Based on our discoveries, we propose SACL, a framework that enriches
textual information and reduces bias by augmenting code or structural knowledge
with semantic information. Extensive experiments show that SACL substantially
improves code retrieval (e.g., by 12.8% / 9.4% / 7.0% Recall@1 on HumanEval /
MBPP / SWE-Bench-Lite), which also leads to better code generation performance
(e.g., by 4.88% Pass@1 on HumanEval).

Abstract: Integrating compositional and symbolic properties into current distributional
semantic spaces can enhance the interpretability, controllability,

perspective on latent space geometry through the lens of compositional
semantics, a direction we refer to as \textit{semantic representation
learning}. This direction enables a bridge between symbolic and distributional
semantics, helping to mitigate the gap between them. We review and compare
three mainstream autoencoder architectures-Variational AutoEncoder (VAE),
Vector Quantised VAE (VQVAE), and Sparse AutoEncoder (SAE)-and examine the
distinctive latent geometries they induce in relation to semantic structure and
interpretability.

Abstract: Time-series data are critical in diverse applications, such as industrial
monitoring, medical diagnostics, and climate research. However, effectively
integrating these high-dimensional temporal signals with natural language for
dynamic, interactive tasks remains a significant challenge. To address this, we
introduce the Time-Series Question Answering (Time-Series QA) task and release
EngineMT-QA, the first large-scale, multi-task, temporal-textual QA dataset
designed to capture complex interactions between time-series signals and
natural language. Building on this resource, we propose the Instruct Time
Transformer (ITFormer), a novel framework that bridges time-series encoders
with frozen large language models (LLMs). ITFormer effectively extracts,
aligns, and fuses temporal and textual features, achieving a strong improvement
in QA accuracy over strong baselines with fewer than 1\% additional trainable
parameters. By combining computational efficiency with robust cross-modal
modeling, our work establishes a adaptable paradigm for integrating temporal
data with natural language, paving the way for new research and applications in
multi-modal AI. More details about the project, including datasets and code,

Result: 三阶段框架显著提升PPV至0.159，运营成本降至5.58美元/千份报告，人工审核报告从192降至88。

Conclusion: 三阶段LLM框架为AI辅助放射学报告质量保证提供了有效策略。

Abstract: Background: The positive predictive value (PPV) of large language model
(LLM)-based proofreading for radiology reports is limited due to the low error
prevalence. Purpose: To assess whether a three-pass LLM framework enhances PPV
and reduces operational costs compared with baseline approaches. Materials and
Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on 1,000 consecutive radiology
reports (250 each: radiography, ultrasonography, CT, MRI) from the MIMIC-III
database. Two external datasets (CheXpert and Open-i) were validation sets.
Three LLM frameworks were tested: (1) single-prompt detector; (2) extractor
plus detector; and (3) extractor, detector, and false-positive verifier.
Precision was measured by PPV and absolute true positive rate (aTPR).
Efficiency was calculated from model inference charges and reviewer
remuneration. Statistical significance was tested using cluster bootstrap,
exact McNemar tests, and Holm-Bonferroni correction. Results: Framework PPV
increased from 0.063 (95% CI, 0.036-0.101, Framework 1) to 0.079 (0.049-0.118,
Framework 2), and significantly to 0.159 (0.090-0.252, Framework 3; P<.001 vs.
baselines). aTPR remained stable (0.012-0.014; P>=.84). Operational costs per
1,000 reports dropped to USD 5.58 (Framework 3) from USD 9.72 (Framework 1) and
USD 6.85 (Framework 2), reflecting reductions of 42.6% and 18.5%, respectively.
Human-reviewed reports decreased from 192 to 88. External validation supported
Framework 3's superior PPV (CheXpert 0.133, Open-i 0.105) and stable aTPR
(0.007). Conclusion: A three-pass LLM framework significantly enhanced PPV and
reduced operational costs, maintaining detection performance, providing an
effective strategy for AI-assisted radiology report quality assurance.

### [32] [Leveraging AI Graders for Missing Score Imputation to Achieve Accurate Ability Estimation in Constructed-Response Tests](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20119)
*Masaki Uto,Yuma Ito*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用自动评分技术填补缺失分数的新方法，以提高IRT能力估计的准确性并减少人工评分工作量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估学习者的高阶能力（如表达能力和逻辑思维）需求增加，但传统构建反应测试需要大量人工评分，成本高。IRT虽能从不完整数据估计能力，但缺失分数比例高时准确性下降。

Method: 利用自动评分技术填补缺失分数，结合IRT进行能力估计。

Result: 新方法在能力估计中达到高准确性，显著减少人工评分工作量。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了IRT在稀疏或异构数据中的局限性，为教育评估提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Evaluating the abilities of learners is a fundamental objective in the field
of education. In particular, there is an increasing need to assess higher-order
abilities such as expressive skills and logical thinking. Constructed-response
tests such as short-answer and essay-based questions have become widely used as
a method to meet this demand. Although these tests are effective, they require
substantial manual grading, making them both labor-intensive and costly. Item
response theory (IRT) provides a promising solution by enabling the estimation
of ability from incomplete score data, where human raters grade only a subset
of answers provided by learners across multiple test items. However, the
accuracy of ability estimation declines as the proportion of missing scores
increases. Although data augmentation techniques for imputing missing scores
have been explored in order to address this limitation, they often struggle
with inaccuracy for sparse or heterogeneous data. To overcome these challenges,
this study proposes a novel method for imputing missing scores by leveraging
automated scoring technologies for accurate IRT-based ability estimation. The
proposed method achieves high accuracy in ability estimation while markedly
reducing manual grading workload.

*Aashiq Muhamed*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出CCRS（Contextual Coherence and Relevance Score）评估框架，利用预训练LLM作为零样本端到端评估器，解决RAG系统输出质量的多元评估问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统评估方法在捕捉上下文连贯性、查询相关性、事实正确性等多元质量方面存在不足，需要更高效、全面的评估框架。

Method: 设计CCRS，包含五个指标（CC、QR、ID、AC、IR），利用单一预训练LLM进行零样本端到端评估。

Result: 在BioASQ数据集上验证CCRS能有效区分不同RAG系统性能，如Mistral-7B优于Llama变体，且计算效率优于RAGChecker。

Conclusion: CCRS为RAG系统提供了实用、全面且高效的评估框架，支持迭代改进。

Abstract: RAG systems enhance LLMs by incorporating external knowledge, which is
crucial for domains that demand factual accuracy and up-to-date information.
However, evaluating the multifaceted quality of RAG outputs, spanning aspects
such as contextual coherence, query relevance, factual correctness, and
informational completeness, poses significant challenges. Existing evaluation
methods often rely on simple lexical overlap metrics, which are inadequate for
capturing these nuances, or involve complex multi-stage pipelines with
intermediate steps like claim extraction or require finetuning specialized
judge models, hindering practical efficiency. To address these limitations, we
propose CCRS (Contextual Coherence and Relevance Score), a novel suite of five
metrics that utilizes a single, powerful, pretrained LLM as a zero-shot,
end-to-end judge. CCRS evaluates: Contextual Coherence (CC), Question Relevance
(QR), Information Density (ID), Answer Correctness (AC), and Information Recall
(IR). We apply CCRS to evaluate six diverse RAG system configurations on the
challenging BioASQ dataset. Our analysis demonstrates that CCRS effectively
discriminates between system performances, confirming, for instance, that the
Mistral-7B reader outperforms Llama variants. We provide a detailed analysis of
CCRS metric properties, including score distributions, convergent/discriminant
validity, tie rates, population statistics, and discriminative power. Compared
to the complex RAGChecker framework, CCRS offers comparable or superior
discriminative power for key aspects like recall and faithfulness, while being
significantly more computationally efficient. CCRS thus provides a practical,
comprehensive, and efficient framework for evaluating and iteratively improving
RAG systems.

*Ruosen Li,Ziming Luo,Quan Zhang,Ruochen Li,Ben Zhou,Ali Payani,Xinya Du*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AALC是一种轻量级的准确性感知长度奖励方法，通过动态平衡正确性和简洁性，显著减少推理长度50%以上，同时保持或提升准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）生成冗长的思维链导致高延迟和成本，但准确性提升不明显。

Method: AALC将验证准确性纳入奖励，并采用动态调度的长度惩罚，延迟长度惩罚直至达到目标性能。

Result: 在标准和非分布数学基准测试中，AALC减少响应长度50%以上，同时保持或提升准确性。

Conclusion: AALC通过奖励策略引导LRMs生成更高效、通用的推理路径，但可能牺牲部分可解释性。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve impressive reasoning capabilities by
generating lengthy chain-of-thoughts, but this "overthinking" incurs high
latency and cost without commensurate accuracy gains. In this work, we
introduce AALC, a lightweight, accuracy-aware length reward integrated into
reinforcement learning that dynamically balances correctness and brevity during
training. By incorporating validation accuracy into the reward and employing a
smooth, dynamically scheduled length penalty, AALC delays length penalty until
target performance is met. Through extensive experiments across standard and
out-of-distribution math benchmarks, we show that our approach reduces response
length by over 50% while maintaining or even improving the original accuracy.
Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that our method curbs redundant
reasoning patterns such as excessive subgoal setting and verification, leading
to structurally refined outputs rather than naive truncation. We also identify
that efficiency gains are accompanied by reduced interpretability: models
trained with AALC omit some narrative framing and explanatory context. These
findings highlight the potential of reward-based strategies to guide LRMs
toward more efficient, generalizable reasoning paths.

*Fengze Li,Yue Wang,Yangle Liu,Ming Huang,Dou Hong,Jieming Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SEED模型通过结合结构编码器和语言模型，解决了多元时间序列预测中结构依赖与语义推理的兼容性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有结构编码器缺乏语义推理能力，而语言模型无法直接处理时间序列数据，限制了统一预测系统的发展。

Method: SEED包含四个阶段：令牌感知编码器、投影模块、语义重编程机制和冻结语言模型，实现数值模式与语义推理的对齐。

Result: 实验表明，SEED在多个数据集上优于基线模型，有效填补了结构-语义建模的空白。

Conclusion: SEED为多元时间序列预测提供了一种统一且可迁移的解决方案。

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting requires models to simultaneously
capture variable-wise structural dependencies and generalize across diverse
tasks. While structural encoders are effective in modeling feature
interactions, they lack the capacity to support semantic-level reasoning or
task adaptation. Conversely, large language models (LLMs) possess strong
generalization capabilities but remain incompatible with raw time series
inputs. This gap limits the development of unified, transferable prediction
systems. Therefore, we introduce SEED, a structural encoder for
embedding-driven decoding, which integrates four stages: a token-aware encoder
for patch extraction, a projection module that aligns patches with language
model embeddings, a semantic reprogramming mechanism that maps patches to
task-aware prototypes, and a frozen language model for prediction. This modular
architecture decouples representation learning from inference, enabling
efficient alignment between numerical patterns and semantic reasoning.
Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves consistent
improvements over strong baselines, and comparative studies on various datasets
confirm SEED's role in addressing the structural-semantic modeling gap.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: COIN框架通过统计校准阈值，在用户指定的FDR约束下筛选生成文本，显著提升样本保留率并确保FDR控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有不确定性量化方法缺乏形式化保证的问题，特别是针对选择性预测中的错误发现率（FDR）。

Method: 采用统计置信区间方法（如Clopper-Pearson）校准阈值，过滤生成答案，确保FDR控制。

Result: COIN在风险控制、样本保留和预测效率方面表现优异，适用于多模态文本生成任务。

Conclusion: COIN框架具有扩展性和适应性，能有效提升不确定性量化在生成文本中的实用性。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) for foundation models is essential to
identify and mitigate potential hallucinations in automatically generated text.
However, heuristic UQ approaches lack formal guarantees for key metrics such as
the false discovery rate (FDR) in selective prediction. Previous work adopts
the split conformal prediction (SCP) framework to ensure desired coverage of
admissible answers by constructing prediction sets, but these sets often
contain incorrect candidates, limiting their practical utility. To address
this, we propose COIN, an uncertainty-guarding selection framework that
calibrates statistically valid thresholds to filter a single generated answer
per question under user-specified FDR constraints. COIN estimates the empirical
error rate on a calibration set and applies confidence interval methods such as
Clopper-Pearson to establish a high-probability upper bound on the true error
rate (i.e., FDR). This enables the selection of the largest uncertainty
threshold that ensures FDR control on test data while significantly increasing
sample retention. We demonstrate COIN's robustness in risk control, strong
test-time power in retaining admissible answers, and predictive efficiency
under limited calibration data across both general and multimodal text
generation tasks. Furthermore, we show that employing alternative upper bound
constructions and UQ strategies can further boost COIN's power performance,
which underscores its extensibility and adaptability to diverse application
scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在多个领域有广泛应用，但在主观任务（如情感识别）中实现高精度仍具挑战性。

Method: 研究了随机和增强示例检索策略，并分析了对话上下文对CER准确性的影响。

Result: 增强示例检索在所有数据集（IEMOCAP、MELD、EmoryNLP）中表现最佳。

Conclusion: 检索具有一致性的目标示例并通过改写增强，对提升CER准确性至关重要。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have enabled a wide variety of real-world
applications in various domains. However, creating a high-performing
application with high accuracy remains challenging, particularly for subjective
tasks like emotion recognition. Inspired by the SLT 2024 GenSER Challenge, this
study investigates approaches to improving conversational emotion recognition
(CER) by LLMs. Specifically, we explore how to retrieve high-quality examples
in in-context learning (ICL) to enhance CER. We propose various strategies
based on random and augmented example retrieval and also analyze the impact of
conversational context on CER accuracy. Experiments were conducted on the three
datasets including IEMOCAP, MELD and EmoryNLP. The results show that augmented
example retrieval consistently outperforms other techniques under investigation
across all datasets, highlighting the importance of retrieving coherent
targeted examples and enhancing them through paraphrasing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨捷克语和多语言句子嵌入模型在不同评估范式中的表现差异，揭示语义属性与下游任务之间的复杂关系。

Method: 使用Costra数据集和STS基准进行内在评估，通过COMET指标进行外在评估（机器翻译任务）。

Result: 内在语义相似性表现好的模型在下游任务中未必最优，而某些看似过平滑的模型通过微调反而表现优异。

Conclusion: 需进一步研究句子嵌入的‘可操作语义’或更深入的下游任务数据集（如翻译评估）。

Abstract: In this paper, we compare Czech-specific and multilingual sentence embedding
models through intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation paradigms. For intrinsic
evaluation, we employ Costra, a complex sentence transformation dataset, and
several Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) benchmarks to assess the ability of
the embeddings to capture linguistic phenomena such as semantic similarity,
temporal aspects, and stylistic variations. In the extrinsic evaluation, we
fine-tune each embedding model using COMET-based metrics for machine
translation evaluation.
  Our experiments reveal an interesting disconnect: models that excel in
intrinsic semantic similarity tests do not consistently yield superior
performance on downstream translation evaluation tasks. Conversely, models with
seemingly over-smoothed embedding spaces can, through fine-tuning, achieve
excellent results. These findings highlight the complex relationship between
semantic property probes and downstream task, emphasizing the need for more
research into 'operationalizable semantics' in sentence embeddings, or more
in-depth downstream tasks datasets (here translation evaluation)

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种多视角方法，使用软标签处理NLP中的标注分歧，以更好地代表少数观点，并在多个主观分类任务中验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法通过聚合标注者观点生成单一真实标签，但可能忽视少数观点。本研究旨在通过多视角方法更好地捕捉人类分歧，促进更具包容性的模型。

Method: 采用多视角方法和软标签，分析多个主观文本分类任务（如仇恨言论、讽刺、辱骂语言和立场检测），并与传统方法对比。

Result: 多视角方法在Jensen-Shannon Divergence（JSD）和F1分数上优于传统方法，但在讽刺和立场检测任务中置信度较低。

Conclusion: 多视角方法能更好地捕捉人类分歧，提升模型性能，但在高度主观的任务中仍需改进。XAI揭示了模型预测的不确定性。

Abstract: In the realm of Natural Language Processing (NLP), common approaches for
handling human disagreement consist of aggregating annotators' viewpoints to
establish a single ground truth. However, prior studies show that disregarding
individual opinions can lead can lead to the side effect of underrepresenting
minority perspectives, especially in subjective tasks, where annotators may
systematically disagree because of their preferences. Recognizing that labels
reflect the diverse backgrounds, life experiences, and values of individuals,
this study proposes a new multi-perspective approach using soft labels to
encourage the development of the next generation of perspective aware models,
more inclusive and pluralistic. We conduct an extensive analysis across diverse
subjective text classification tasks, including hate speech, irony, abusive
language, and stance detection, to highlight the importance of capturing human
disagreements, often overlooked by traditional aggregation methods. Results
show that the multi-perspective approach not only better approximates human
label distributions, as measured by Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD), but also
achieves superior classification performance (higher F1 scores), outperforming
traditional approaches. However, our approach exhibits lower confidence in
tasks like irony and stance detection, likely due to the inherent subjectivity
present in the texts. Lastly, leveraging Explainable AI (XAI), we explore model
uncertainty and uncover meaningful insights into model predictions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在复杂逻辑推理任务中表现不佳，主要依赖统计关系而非结构化知识表示。

Method: 将非结构化数据转换为结构化格式，并通过监督微调（SFT）和GRPO算法（含MAX-Flow和LCS）训练LLMs。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B模型上实现了简洁推理、鲁棒性能和优化兼容性。

Conclusion: 结构化推理显著提升了LLMs的推理能力，验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced natural
language processing and automated decision-making. However, these models still
encounter difficulties when performing complex reasoning tasks involving
logical deduction and systematic planning, primarily due to their reliance on
implicit statistical relationships without structured knowledge
representation.Inspired by cognitive science and neurosymbolic AI, we introduce
a novel approach to enhance LLMs through explicit structured reasoning. First,
we convert unstructured data into structured formats by explicitly annotating
reasoning steps. We then employ this structured dataset to train LLMs through
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Additionally, we enhance the structured reasoning
capabilities of LLMs using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO),
incorporating two innovative algorithms--MAX-Flow and Longest Common
Subsequence (LCS)--which notably improve reasoning effectiveness and reduce
computational complexity. Experimental results from fine-tuning a
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B model demonstrate concise reasoning, robust
performance across various scenarios, and improved compatibility with
optimization techniques, validating the efficacy of structured reasoning
integration in LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非母语者的语音流畅度评估（AFA）在捕捉语音节奏、停顿和不流畅性方面仍具挑战性，需要更精细的分析方法。

Method: 采用分块策略，结合Wav2Vec2、HuBERT和WavLM等自监督学习模型，通过Silero-VAD分割语音，并利用CNN-BiLSTM框架进行特征融合和依赖建模。

Result: 在Avalinguo和Speechocean762数据集上，F1分数和Pearson相关系数分别提升了2.8-4.2和6.2-4.0分，优于单模型和Pyannote.audio基线。

Conclusion: 分块多模型融合方法在流畅度评估中表现优异，但未来需研究其在非规则韵律方言中的泛化能力。

Abstract: Automatic fluency assessment (AFA) remains challenging, particularly in
capturing speech rhythm, pauses, and disfluencies in non-native speakers. We
introduce a chunk-based approach integrating self-supervised learning (SSL)
models (Wav2Vec2, HuBERT, and WavLM) selected for their complementary strengths
in phonetic, prosodic, and noisy speech modeling, with a hierarchical
CNN-BiLSTM framework. Speech is segmented into breath-group chunks using Silero
voice activity detection (Silero-VAD), enabling fine-grained temporal analysis
while mitigating over-segmentation artifacts. SSL embeddings are fused via a
learnable weighted mechanism, balancing acoustic and linguistic features, and
enriched with chunk-level fluency markers (e.g., speech rate, pause durations,
n-gram repetitions). The CNN-BiLSTM captures local and long-term dependencies
across chunks. Evaluated on Avalinguo and Speechocean762, our approach improves
F1-score by 2.8 and Pearson correlation by 6.2 points over single SSL baselines
on Speechocean762, with gains of 4.2 F1-score and 4.0 Pearson points on
Avalinguo, surpassing Pyannote.audio-based segmentation baselines. These
findings highlight chunk-based multi-SSL fusion for robust fluency evaluation,
though future work should explore generalization to dialects with irregular
prosody.

Result: 大型语言模型能高效提取叙事变化，但区分内容与叙事变化的能力有限。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能动态分析叙事演变，但需进一步优化以区分内容与叙事变化。

Abstract: With rapidly evolving media narratives, it has become increasingly critical
to not just extract narratives from a given corpus but rather investigate, how
they develop over time. While popular narrative extraction methods such as
Large Language Models do well in capturing typical narrative elements or even
the complex structure of a narrative, applying them to an entire corpus comes
with obstacles, such as a high financial or computational cost. We propose a
combination of the language understanding capabilities of Large Language Models
with the large scale applicability of topic models to dynamically model
narrative shifts across time using the Narrative Policy Framework. We apply a
topic model and a corresponding change point detection method to find changes
that concern a specific topic of interest. Using this model, we filter our
corpus for documents that are particularly representative of that change and
feed them into a Large Language Model that interprets the change that happened
in an automated fashion and distinguishes between content and narrative shifts.
We employ our pipeline on a corpus of The Wall Street Journal news paper
articles from 2009 to 2023. Our findings indicate that a Large Language Model
can efficiently extract a narrative shift if one exists at a given point in
time, but does not perform as well when having to decide whether a shift in
content or a narrative shift took place.

Motivation: 临床文本通常因隐私限制难以获取，Biomed-Enriched提供了一个公开的大规模临床案例数据集。

Method: 通过大型语言模型标注PubMed段落的类型、领域和教育质量，再用小型模型扩展标注至整个PMC-OA语料库。

Result: 数据集包含200万临床案例段落，其中45万高质量，实验显示其在生物医学预训练中提升性能。

Conclusion: Biomed-Enriched为生物医学NLP提供了高效且有效的预训练资源，实验证明了其潜力。

Abstract: We introduce Biomed-Enriched, a biomedical text dataset constructed from
PubMed via a two-stage annotation process. In the first stage, a large language
model annotates 400K paragraphs from PubMed scientific articles, assigning
scores for their type (review, study, clinical case, other), domain (clinical,
biomedical, other), and educational quality. The educational quality score
(rated 1 to 5) estimates how useful a paragraph is for college-level learning.
These annotations are then used to fine-tune a small language model, which
propagates the labels across the full PMC-OA corpus. The resulting metadata
allows us to extract refined subsets, including 2M clinical case paragraphs
with over 450K high-quality ones from articles with commercial-use licenses,
and to construct several variants via quality filtering and domain upsampling.
Clinical text is typically difficult to access due to privacy constraints, as
hospital records cannot be publicly shared. Hence, our dataset provides an
alternative large-scale, openly available collection of clinical cases from
PubMed, making it a valuable resource for biomedical and clinical NLP.
Preliminary continual-pretraining experiments with OLMo2 suggest these curated
subsets enable targeted improvements, with clinical upsampling boosting
performance by ~5% on MMLU ProfMed and educational quality filtering improving
MedQA and MedMCQA by ~1%. Combinations of these techniques led to faster
convergence, reaching same performance with a third of training tokens,
indicating potential for more efficient and effective biomedical pretraining
strategies.

TL;DR: DeepRare是一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）的罕见病诊断系统，通过处理异构临床输入生成诊断假设，并在多个数据集上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 罕见病诊断因临床异质性、低患病率和医生对罕见病的了解有限而具有挑战性。

Method: DeepRare由中央主机、长期记忆模块和专用代理服务器组成，整合了40多种工具和最新医学知识。

Result: 在2,919种疾病中，DeepRare对1,013种疾病达到100%准确率，显著优于其他15种方法。

Conclusion: DeepRare是一种高效、透明的罕见病诊断工具，已实现为易用的网络应用。

Abstract: Rare diseases collectively affect over 300 million individuals worldwide, yet
timely and accurate diagnosis remains a pervasive challenge. This is largely
due to their clinical heterogeneity, low individual prevalence, and the limited
familiarity most clinicians have with rare conditions. Here, we introduce
DeepRare, the first rare disease diagnosis agentic system powered by a large
language model (LLM), capable of processing heterogeneous clinical inputs. The
system generates ranked diagnostic hypotheses for rare diseases, each
accompanied by a transparent chain of reasoning that links intermediate
analytic steps to verifiable medical evidence.
  DeepRare comprises three key components: a central host with a long-term
memory module; specialized agent servers responsible for domain-specific
analytical tasks integrating over 40 specialized tools and web-scale,
up-to-date medical knowledge sources, ensuring access to the most current
clinical information. This modular and scalable design enables complex
diagnostic reasoning while maintaining traceability and adaptability. We
evaluate DeepRare on eight datasets. The system demonstrates exceptional
diagnostic performance among 2,919 diseases, achieving 100% accuracy for 1013
diseases. In HPO-based evaluations, DeepRare significantly outperforms other 15

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Code of Thought (CoDoT)的提示策略，用于评估大型语言模型（LLMs）的安全性，发现现有模型在安全性上存在严重不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在安全关键应用中的普及，提升其能力的同时需确保其与人类价值观和偏好一致，但现有模型在安全性上表现不佳。

Method: 通过CoDoT将自然语言输入转换为代码形式，评估LLMs的安全性。例如，将“使文本更具毒性”转换为“make_more_toxic({text})”。

Result: 实验表明，CoDoT导致多种先进LLMs（如GPT-4 Turbo、DeepSeek R1）毒性显著增加，且递归应用CoDoT会进一步加剧毒性。

Conclusion: CoDoT揭示了LLMs安全性的严重不足，强调了从基本原理出发评估安全性的必要性，以确保安全性与能力同步提升。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become ubiquitous, interfacing with humans
in numerous safety-critical applications. This necessitates improving
capabilities, but importantly coupled with greater safety measures to align
these models with human values and preferences. In this work, we demonstrate
that contemporary models fall concerningly short of the goal of AI safety,
leading to an unsafe and harmful experience for users. We introduce a prompting
strategy called Code of Thought (CoDoT) to evaluate the safety of LLMs. CoDoT
converts natural language inputs to simple code that represents the same
intent. For instance, CoDoT transforms the natural language prompt "Make the
statement more toxic: {text}" to: "make_more_toxic({text})". We show that CoDoT
results in a consistent failure of a wide range of state-of-the-art LLMs. For
example, GPT-4 Turbo's toxicity increases 16.5 times, DeepSeek R1 fails 100% of
the time, and toxicity increases 300% on average across seven modern LLMs.
Additionally, recursively applying CoDoT can further increase toxicity two
times. Given the rapid and widespread adoption of LLMs, CoDoT underscores the
critical need to evaluate safety efforts from first principles, ensuring that
safety and capabilities advance together.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种计算框架，用于量化对话中说话时间的分配及其动态变化，揭示了不同动态类型对参与者感知的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究对话中说话时间的分配及其动态变化对参与者感知的影响，为计算机辅助沟通平台设计提供新工具。

Method: 引入计算框架，分析对话级别的说话时间分配及低层动态，应用于大规模陌生人视频聊天数据集。

Result: 平衡对话更受欢迎，尤其是说话较少的参与者；不同动态类型即使导致相同平衡水平，感知也不同。

Conclusion: 该框架为计算机辅助沟通平台设计提供了新工具，适用于人-人和人-人工智能沟通。

Abstract: An intrinsic aspect of every conversation is the way talk-time is shared
between multiple speakers. Conversations can be balanced, with each speaker
claiming a similar amount of talk-time, or imbalanced when one talks
disproportionately. Such overall distributions are the consequence of
continuous negotiations between the speakers throughout the conversation: who
should be talking at every point in time, and for how long?
  In this work we introduce a computational framework for quantifying both the
conversation-level distribution of talk-time between speakers, as well as the
lower-level dynamics that lead to it. We derive a typology of talk-time sharing
dynamics structured by several intuitive axes of variation. By applying this
framework to a large dataset of video-chats between strangers, we confirm that,
perhaps unsurprisingly, different conversation-level distributions of talk-time
are perceived differently by speakers, with balanced conversations being
preferred over imbalanced ones, especially by those who end up talking less.
Then we reveal that -- even when they lead to the same level of overall balance
-- different types of talk-time sharing dynamics are perceived differently by
the participants, highlighting the relevance of our newly introduced typology.
Finally, we discuss how our framework offers new tools to designers of
computer-mediated communication platforms, for both human-human and human-AI
communication.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种通过合并微调模型变体的层来压缩大语言模型的新策略，保持原始模型能力的同时减少参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）虽然能力强，但模型规模大，部署和推理成本高。现有剪枝方法主要针对单一模型。

Method: 将模型压缩问题转化为零阶优化问题，支持层移除、层选择和层合并三种操作。

Result: 实验表明，压缩后的模型（如Llama2-13B）在减少25%参数的同时保持97.3%的性能，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLMs的高效部署提供了新思路，代码已开源。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in language
understanding and generation. However, such impressive capability typically
comes with a substantial model size, which presents significant challenges in
deployment and inference. While structured pruning of model parameters offers a
promising way to reduce computational costs at deployment time, current methods
primarily focus on single model pruning. In this work, we develop a novel
strategy to compress models by strategically combining or merging layers from
finetuned model variants, which preserves the original model's abilities by
aggregating capabilities accentuated in different finetunes. We pose the
optimal tailoring of these LLMs as a zero-order optimization problem, adopting
a search space that supports three different operations: (1) Layer removal, (2)
Layer selection from different candidate models, and (3) Layer merging. Our
experiments demonstrate that this approach leads to competitive model pruning,
for example, for the Llama2-13B model families, our compressed models maintain
approximately 97.3\% of the original performance while removing $\sim25\%$ of
parameters, significantly outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods. The

TL;DR: ReCode框架通过强化学习帮助大语言模型适应动态API更新，显著提升代码生成性能，同时减少对通用能力的负面影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在外部库API频繁更新时表现不佳，因其依赖过时的训练数据知识。

Method: 构建2000条数据训练模型，引入改进的字符串相似度指标作为强化学习奖励。

Result: ReCode显著提升动态API场景下的代码生成性能，尤其在未见任务CodeUpdateArena上表现优异。

Conclusion: ReCode在多种大语言模型和强化学习算法中均表现一致改进，且对通用能力影响较小。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable code generation capabilities
but falter when adapting to frequent updates in external library APIs. This
critical limitation, stemming from reliance on outdated API knowledge from
their training data, even with access to current documentation, impedes
reliable code generation in dynamic environments. To tackle this issue, we
propose ReCode (rule-based Reinforcement learning for Code Update), a novel
framework that mimics human programmer adaptation to API changes. Specifically,
we construct a dataset of approximately 2,000 data entries to train the LLMs to
perform version migration based on updated information. Then, we introduce a
modified string similarity metric for code evaluation as the reward for
reinforcement learning. Our experiments demonstrate that ReCode substantially
boosts LLMs' code generation performance in dynamic API scenarios, especially
on the unseen CodeUpdateArena task. Crucially, compared to supervised
fine-tuning, ReCode has less impact on LLMs' general code generation abilities.
We apply ReCode on various LLMs and reinforcement learning algorithms (GRPO and
DAPO), all achieving consistent improvements. Notably, after training,
Qwen2.5-Coder-7B outperforms that of the 32B parameter code instruction-tuned
model and the reasoning model with the same architecture. Code is available at

Method: 通过分析Qwen和Llama模型家族，研究中训练策略对RL动态的影响，并提出两阶段训练策略Stable-then-Decay。

Result: 发现高质量数学语料和QA数据能显著提升RL性能，但需注意数据格式化；提出的策略成功缩小了与RL友好模型的性能差距。

Conclusion: 研究为RL时代的基础模型预训练策略提供了重要见解，并开源了模型和语料库以支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Different base language model families, such as Llama and Qwen, exhibit
divergent behaviors during post-training with reinforcement learning (RL),
especially on reasoning-intensive tasks. What makes a base language model
suitable for reinforcement learning? Gaining deeper insight into this question
is essential for developing RL-scalable foundation models of the next
generation. In this work, we investigate how mid-training strategies shape RL
dynamics, focusing on two representative model families: Qwen and Llama. Our
study reveals that (1) high-quality mathematical corpora, such as
MegaMath-Web-Pro, significantly improve both base model and RL performance,
while existing alternatives (e.g., FineMath-4plus) fail to do so; (2) further
adding QA-style data, particularly long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
examples, enhances RL outcomes, and instruction data further unlocks this
effect; (3) while long-CoT improves reasoning depth, it can also induce
verbosity of model responses and unstability of RL training, underscoring the
importance of data formatting; (4) scaling mid-training consistently leads to
stronger downstream RL performance. Building on these insights, we introduce a
two-stage mid-training strategy, Stable-then-Decay, in which base models are
first trained on 200B tokens with a constant learning rate, followed by 20B
tokens across three CoT-focused branches with learning rate decay. This yields
OctoThinker, a family of models demonstrating strong RL compatibility and
closing the performance gap with more RL-friendly model families, i.e., Qwen.
We hope our work will help shape pre-training strategies for foundation models
in the RL era. To support further research, we release our open-source models
along with a curated math reasoning-intensive corpus of over 70 billion tokens
(i.e., MegaMath-Web-Pro-Max).

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shifted focus toward
scaling inference-time compute, improving performance without retraining the
model. A common approach is to sample multiple outputs in parallel, and select
one of these as the final output. However, work to date has focused on English
and a handful of domains such as math and code. In contrast, we are most
interested in techniques that generalize across open-ended tasks, formally
verifiable tasks, and across languages. In this work, we study how to robustly
scale inference-time compute for open-ended generative tasks in a multilingual,
multi-task setting.
  Our findings show that both sampling strategy based on temperature variation
and selection strategy must be adapted to account for diverse domains and
varied language settings. We evaluate existing selection methods, revealing
that strategies effective in English often fail to generalize across languages.
We propose novel sampling and selection strategies specifically adapted for
multilingual and multi-task inference scenarios, and show they yield notable
gains across languages and tasks. In particular, our combined sampling and
selection methods lead to an average +6.8 jump in win-rates for our 8B models
on m-ArenaHard-v2.0 prompts, against proprietary models such as Gemini. At
larger scale, Command-A (111B model) equipped with our methods, shows +9.0
improvement in win-rates on the same benchmark with just five samples against
single-sample decoding, a substantial increase at minimal cost. Our results
underscore the need for language- and task-aware approaches to inference-time
compute, aiming to democratize performance improvements in underrepresented
languages.

Motivation: LLM代理在高风险领域可能引发严重的安全和伦理问题，如物理伤害或经济损失，因此需要一种高效的方法来引导其行为。

Method: 将代理行为引导视为模型编辑任务，提出行为编辑方法，并引入基于心理学道德理论的多层次基准BehaviorBench进行评估。

Result: 行为编辑能动态调整代理在特定场景中的行为，并实现其全球道德对齐的广泛转变，既能促进伦理行为，也能诱导有害行为。

Conclusion: 行为编辑为代理行为引导提供了新范式，展示了其潜力和风险。

Abstract: Agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong
capabilities across a wide range of tasks. However, deploying LLM-based agents
in high-stakes domains comes with significant safety and ethical risks.
Unethical behavior by these agents can directly result in serious real-world
consequences, including physical harm and financial loss. To efficiently steer
the ethical behavior of agents, we frame agent behavior steering as a model
editing task, which we term Behavior Editing. Model editing is an emerging area
of research that enables precise and efficient modifications to LLMs while
preserving their overall capabilities. To systematically study and evaluate
this approach, we introduce BehaviorBench, a multi-tier benchmark grounded in
psychological moral theories. This benchmark supports both the evaluation and
editing of agent behaviors across a variety of scenarios, with each tier
introducing more complex and ambiguous scenarios. We first demonstrate that
Behavior Editing can dynamically steer agents toward the target behavior within
specific scenarios. Moreover, Behavior Editing enables not only
scenario-specific local adjustments but also more extensive shifts in an
agent's global moral alignment. We demonstrate that Behavior Editing can be
used to promote ethical and benevolent behavior or, conversely, to induce
harmful or malicious behavior. Through comprehensive evaluations on agents
based on frontier LLMs, BehaviorBench shows the effectiveness of Behavior
Editing across different models and scenarios. Our findings offer key insights
into a new paradigm for steering agent behavior, highlighting both the promise
and perils of Behavior Editing.

Motivation: 探索dLLMs在代码生成中的优势，解决其训练和推理机制未被充分研究的问题。

Method: 训练7B参数的dLLM模型DiffuCoder，分析其解码行为，并提出coupled-GRPO采样方案优化RL训练。

Result: DiffuCoder在代码生成基准上性能提升4.4%，减少了对AR因果解码的依赖。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了dLLMs的生成机制，并提供了有效的扩散原生RL训练框架。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) are compelling alternatives to
autoregressive (AR) models because their denoising models operate over the
entire sequence. The global planning and iterative refinement features of dLLMs
are particularly useful for code generation. However, current training and
inference mechanisms for dLLMs in coding are still under-explored. To demystify
the decoding behavior of dLLMs and unlock their potential for coding, we
systematically investigate their denoising processes and reinforcement learning
(RL) methods. We train a 7B dLLM, \textbf{DiffuCoder}, on 130B tokens of code.
Using this model as a testbed, we analyze its decoding behavior, revealing how
it differs from that of AR models: (1) dLLMs can decide how causal their
generation should be without relying on semi-AR decoding, and (2) increasing
the sampling temperature diversifies not only token choices but also their
generation order. This diversity creates a rich search space for RL rollouts.
For RL training, to reduce the variance of token log-likelihood estimates and
maintain training efficiency, we propose \textbf{coupled-GRPO}, a novel
sampling scheme that constructs complementary mask noise for completions used
in training. In our experiments, coupled-GRPO significantly improves
DiffuCoder's performance on code generation benchmarks (+4.4\% on EvalPlus) and
reduces reliance on AR causal during decoding. Our work provides deeper insight
into the machinery of dLLM generation and offers an effective, diffusion-native
RL training framework. https://github.com/apple/ml-diffucoder.

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Memento显著提升了性能，如在PhantomWiki上性能翻倍，在2WikiMultiHopQA上提升超过20 F1点。

Conclusion: Memento是一种有效的策略，能够显著提升大型语言模型在复杂推理和检索任务中的表现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at reasoning-only tasks, but struggle when
reasoning must be tightly coupled with retrieval, as in multi-hop question
answering. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a prompting strategy
that first decomposes a complex question into smaller steps, then dynamically
constructs a database of facts using LLMs, and finally pieces these facts
together to solve the question. We show how this three-stage strategy, which we
call Memento, can boost the performance of existing prompting strategies across
diverse settings. On the 9-step PhantomWiki benchmark, Memento doubles the
performance of chain-of-thought (CoT) when all information is provided in
context. On the open-domain version of 2WikiMultiHopQA, CoT-RAG with Memento
improves over vanilla CoT-RAG by more than 20 F1 percentage points and over the
multi-hop RAG baseline, IRCoT, by more than 13 F1 percentage points. On the
challenging MuSiQue dataset, Memento improves ReAct by more than 3 F1
percentage points, demonstrating its utility in agentic settings.

Method: 方法是通过认知模型（礼貌语言模型）系统评估LLM的价值权衡，包括前沿黑盒模型的推理“努力”程度和开源模型的强化学习后训练动态。

Conclusion: 结论是该方法能适应快速发展的LLM领域，为高维行为假设、推理模型训练和训练中价值权衡的控制提供了见解。

Abstract: Navigating everyday social situations often requires juggling conflicting
goals, such as conveying a harsh truth, maintaining trust, all while still
being mindful of another person's feelings. These value trade-offs are an
integral part of human decision-making and language use, however, current tools
for interpreting such dynamic and multi-faceted notions of values in LLMs are
limited. In cognitive science, so-called "cognitive models" provide formal
accounts of these trade-offs in humans, by modeling the weighting of a
speaker's competing utility functions in choosing an action or utterance. In
this work, we use a leading cognitive model of polite speech to interpret the
extent to which LLMs represent human-like trade-offs. We apply this lens to
systematically evaluate value trade-offs in two encompassing model settings:
degrees of reasoning "effort" in frontier black-box models, and RL
post-training dynamics of open-source models. Our results highlight patterns of
higher informational utility than social utility in reasoning models, and in
open-source models shown to be stronger in mathematical reasoning. Our findings
from LLMs' training dynamics suggest large shifts in utility values early on in
training with persistent effects of the choice of base model and pretraining
data, compared to feedback dataset or alignment method. We show that our method
is responsive to diverse aspects of the rapidly evolving LLM landscape, with
insights for forming hypotheses about other high-level behaviors, shaping
training regimes for reasoning models, and better controlling trade-offs
between values during model training.

Abstract: Application rate errors when using self-propelled agricultural sprayers for
agricultural production remain a concern. Among other factors, spray boom
instability is one of the major contributors to application errors. Spray
booms' width of 38m, combined with 30 kph driving speeds, varying terrain, and
machine dynamics when maneuvering complex field boundaries, make controls of
these booms very complex. However, there is no quantitative knowledge on the
extent of boom movement to systematically develop a solution that might include
boom designs and responsive boom control systems. Therefore, this study was
conducted to develop an automated computer vision system to quantify the boom
movement of various agricultural sprayers. A computer vision system was
developed to track a target on the edge of the sprayer boom in real time. YOLO
V7, V8, and V11 neural network models were trained to track the boom's
movements in field operations to quantify effective displacement in the
vertical and transverse directions. An inclinometer sensor was mounted on the
boom to capture boom angles and validate the neural network model output. The
results showed that the model could detect the target with more than 90 percent
accuracy, and distance estimates of the target on the boom were within 0.026 m
of the inclinometer sensor data. This system can quantify the boom movement on
the current sprayer and potentially on any other sprayer with minor
modifications. The data can be used to make design improvements to make sprayer
booms more stable and achieve greater application accuracy.

Abstract: Density map estimation has become the mainstream paradigm in crowd counting.
However, most existing methods overlook the extreme sparsity of ground-truth
density maps. In real-world crowd scenes, the vast majority of spatial regions
(often over 95%) contain no people, leading to heavily imbalanced count
distributions. Ignoring this imbalance can bias models toward overestimating
dense regions and underperforming in sparse areas. Furthermore, most loss
functions used in density estimation are majorly based on MSE and implicitly
assume Gaussian distributions, which are ill-suited for modeling discrete,
non-negative count data. In this paper, we propose EBC-ZIP, a crowd counting
framework that models the spatial distribution of counts using a Zero-Inflated
Poisson (ZIP) regression formulation. Our approach replaces the traditional
regression loss with the negative log-likelihood of the ZIP distribution,
enabling better handling of zero-heavy distributions while preserving count
accuracy. Built upon the recently proposed Enhanced Block Classification (EBC)
framework, EBC-ZIP inherits EBC's advantages in preserving the discreteness of
targets and ensuring training stability, while further improving performance
through a more principled probabilistic loss. We also evaluate EBC-ZIP with
backbones of varying computational complexity to assess its scalability.
Extensive experiments on four crowd counting benchmarks demonstrate that
EBC-ZIP consistently outperforms EBC and achieves state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Token merging has emerged as an effective strategy to accelerate Vision
Transformers (ViT) by reducing computational costs. However, existing methods
primarily rely on the visual token's feature similarity for token merging,
overlooking the potential of integrating spatial information, which can serve
as a reliable criterion for token merging in the early layers of ViT, where the
visual tokens only possess weak visual information. In this paper, we propose
ToSA, a novel token merging method that combines both semantic and spatial
awareness to guide the token merging process. ToSA leverages the depth image as
input to generate pseudo spatial tokens, which serve as auxiliary spatial
information for the visual token merging process. With the introduced spatial
awareness, ToSA achieves a more informed merging strategy that better preserves

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI生成视频的视觉伪影（如运动不一致、物体变形等）影响真实性和用户信任，但缺乏专门用于伪影定位的基准数据集。

Method: 提出BrokenVideos数据集，包含3,254个AI生成视频，带有像素级标注的视觉伪影区域，并通过人工验证确保标注质量。

Result: 实验表明，在BrokenVideos上训练的模型能显著提升伪影定位能力。

Conclusion: BrokenVideos为生成视频模型的伪影定位研究提供了关键基准。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep generative models have led to significant progress in
video generation, yet the fidelity of AI-generated videos remains limited.
Synthesized content often exhibits visual artifacts such as temporally
inconsistent motion, physically implausible trajectories, unnatural object
deformations, and local blurring that undermine realism and user trust.
Accurate detection and spatial localization of these artifacts are crucial for
both automated quality control and for guiding the development of improved
generative models. However, the research community currently lacks a
comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for artifact localization in AI
generated videos. Existing datasets either restrict themselves to video or
frame level detection or lack the fine-grained spatial annotations necessary
for evaluating localization methods. To address this gap, we introduce
BrokenVideos, a benchmark dataset of 3,254 AI-generated videos with
meticulously annotated, pixel-level masks highlighting regions of visual
corruption. Each annotation is validated through detailed human inspection to
ensure high quality ground truth. Our experiments show that training state of
the art artifact detection models and multi modal large language models (MLLMs)
on BrokenVideos significantly improves their ability to localize corrupted
regions. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that BrokenVideos
establishes a critical foundation for benchmarking and advancing research on
artifact localization in generative video models. The dataset is available at:

Abstract: World models have garnered increasing attention in the development of
artificial general intelligence (AGI), serving as computational frameworks for
learning representations of the external world and forecasting future states.
While early efforts focused on 2D visual perception and simulation, recent
3D-aware generative world models have demonstrated the ability to synthesize
geometrically consistent, interactive 3D environments, marking a shift toward
3D spatial cognition. Despite rapid progress, the field lacks systematic
analysis to categorize emerging techniques and clarify their roles in advancing
3D cognitive world models. This survey addresses this need by introducing a
conceptual framework, providing a structured and forward-looking review of
world models transitioning from 2D perception to 3D cognition. Within this
framework, we highlight two key technological drivers, particularly advances in
3D representations and the incorporation of world knowledge, as fundamental
pillars. Building on these, we dissect three core cognitive capabilities that
underpin 3D world modeling: 3D physical scene generation, 3D spatial reasoning,
and 3D spatial interaction. We further examine the deployment of these
capabilities in real-world applications, including embodied AI, autonomous
driving, digital twin, and gaming/VR. Finally, we identify challenges across
data, modeling, and deployment, and outline future directions for advancing
more robust and generalizable 3D world models.

Conclusion: EAR方法有效解决了自回归模型中的概念擦除问题，并通过ECGVF基准提供了更全面的评估。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have achieved unified and strong performance
across both visual understanding and image generation tasks. However, removing
undesired concepts from AR models while maintaining overall generation quality
remains an open challenge. In this paper, we propose Erasure Autoregressive
Model (EAR), a fine-tuning method for effective and utility-preserving concept
erasure in AR models. Specifically, we introduce Windowed Gradient Accumulation
(WGA) strategy to align patch-level decoding with erasure objectives, and
Thresholded Loss Masking (TLM) strategy to protect content unrelated to the
target concept during fine-tuning. Furthermore, we propose a novel benchmark,
Erase Concept Generator and Visual Filter (ECGVF), aim at provide a more
rigorous and comprehensive foundation for evaluating concept erasure in AR
models. Specifically, we first employ structured templates across diverse large
language models (LLMs) to pre-generate a large-scale corpus of
target-replacement concept prompt pairs. Subsequently, we generate images from
these prompts and subject them to rigorous filtering via a visual classifier to
ensure concept fidelity and alignment. Extensive experimental results conducted
on the ECGVF benchmark with the AR model Janus-Pro demonstrate that EAR
achieves marked improvements in both erasure effectiveness and model utility
preservation. Code is available at: https://github.com/immc-lab/ear/

Abstract: Structured pruning is a well-established technique for compressing neural
networks, making it suitable for deployment in resource-limited edge devices.
This paper presents an efficient Loss-Aware Automatic Selection of Structured
Pruning Criteria (LAASP) for slimming and accelerating deep neural networks.
The majority of pruning methodologies employ a sequential process consisting of
three stages: 1) training, 2) pruning, and 3) fine-tuning, whereas the proposed
pruning technique adopts a pruning-while-training approach that eliminates the
first stage and integrates the second and third stages into a single cycle. The
automatic selection of magnitude or similarity-based filter pruning criteria
from a specified pool of criteria and the specific pruning layer at each
pruning iteration is guided by the network's overall loss on a small subset of
the training data. To mitigate the abrupt accuracy drop due to pruning, the
network is retrained briefly after each reduction of a predefined number of
floating-point operations (FLOPs). The optimal pruning rates for each layer in
the network are automatically determined, eliminating the need for manual
allocation of fixed or variable pruning rates for each layer. Experiments on
the VGGNet and ResNet models on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet benchmark datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. In particular, the
ResNet56 and ResNet110 models on the CIFAR-10 dataset significantly improve the
top-1 accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods while reducing the network
FLOPs by 52\%. Furthermore, the ResNet50 model on the ImageNet dataset reduces
FLOPs by more than 42\% with a negligible 0.33\% drop in top-5 accuracy. The

Method: 结合预训练的文本到图像扩散模型和多模态VLM，构建端到端无优化的编辑流程。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多种编辑任务中优于基线方法，且速度提升约4倍。

Conclusion: 该方法为基于示例的图像编辑提供了一种高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-Image Diffusion models have enabled a wide array of image editing
applications. However, capturing all types of edits through text alone can be
challenging and cumbersome. The ambiguous nature of certain image edits is
better expressed through an exemplar pair, i.e., a pair of images depicting an
image before and after an edit respectively. In this work, we tackle
exemplar-based image editing -- the task of transferring an edit from an
exemplar pair to a content image(s), by leveraging pretrained text-to-image
diffusion models and multimodal VLMs. Even though our end-to-end pipeline is
optimization-free, our experiments demonstrate that it still outperforms
baselines on multiple types of edits while being ~4x faster.

Conclusion: GRPO框架有效减少幻觉，提升模型在视觉退化场景下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models have enhanced
document understanding by integrating textual and visual information. However,
existing models exhibit incompleteness within their paradigm in real-world
scenarios, particularly under visual degradation. In such conditions, the
current response paradigm often fails to adequately perceive visual degradation
and ambiguity, leading to overreliance on linguistic priors or misaligned
visual-textual reasoning. This difficulty in recognizing uncertainty frequently
results in the generation of hallucinatory content, especially when a precise
answer is not feasible. To better demonstrate and analyze this phenomenon and
problem, we propose KIE-HVQA, the first benchmark dedicated to evaluating OCR
hallucination in degraded document understanding. This dataset includes test
samples spanning identity cards and invoices, with simulated real-world
degradations for OCR reliability. This setup allows for evaluating models'
capacity, under degraded input, to distinguish reliable visual information and
answer accordingly, thereby highlighting the challenge of avoiding
hallucination on uncertain data. To achieve vision-faithful reasoning and
thereby avoid the aforementioned issues, we further introduce a GRPO-based
framework featuring a novel reward mechanism. By incorporating a self-awareness
of visual uncertainty and an analysis method that initiates refusal to answer
to increase task difficulty within our supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement
learning framework, we successfully mitigated hallucinations in ambiguous
regions. Experiments on Qwen2.5-VL demonstrate that our 7B-parameter model
achieves a 22\% absolute improvement in hallucination-free accuracy over GPT-4o
on KIE-HVQA and there is no significant performance drop in standard tasks,
highlighting both effectiveness and robustness.

Method: 使用GEO-Bench基准测试，评估Prithvi、Hiera和DOFA等模型在11个数据集上的表现，采用特征级集成和知识蒸馏技术。

Result: 特征级集成小模型性能可匹配或超越大模型，且训练时间和计算资源需求更低。

Conclusion: 预训练模型组合及知识蒸馏为地球观测任务提供了高效实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Foundation models are rapidly transforming Earth Observation data mining by
enabling generalizable and scalable solutions for key tasks such as scene
classification and semantic segmentation. While most efforts in the geospatial
domain have focused on developing large models trained from scratch using
massive Earth Observation datasets, an alternative strategy that remains
underexplored is the reuse and combination of existing pretrained models. In
this study, we investigate whether foundation models pretrained on remote
sensing and general vision datasets can be effectively combined to improve
performance across a diverse set of key Earth Observation tasks. Using the
GEO-Bench benchmark, we evaluate several prominent models, including Prithvi,
Hiera, and DOFA, on eleven datasets covering a range of spatial resolutions,
sensor modalities, and task types. The results show that feature-level
ensembling of smaller pretrained models can match or exceed the performance of
much larger models, while requiring less training time and computational
resources. Moreover, the study highlights the potential of applying knowledge
distillation to transfer the strengths of ensembles into more compact models,
offering a practical path for deploying foundation models in real-world Earth
Observation applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Wald协议生成的合成数据无法准确模拟真实世界的退化模式，限制了深度泛锐化模型的泛化能力。

Method: 提出渐进对齐退化模块（PADM），通过两个子网络（PAlignNet和PDegradeNet）自适应学习退化过程；并引入HFreqdiff框架，结合CFB和BACM模块提取高频细节。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在空间清晰度和图像质量上显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: PADM和HFreqdiff有效解决了传统方法的局限性，为高分辨率多光谱图像生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Deep learning-based pansharpening has been shown to effectively generate
high-resolution multispectral (HRMS) images. To create supervised ground-truth
HRMS images, synthetic data generated using the Wald protocol is commonly
employed. This protocol assumes that networks trained on artificial
low-resolution data will perform equally well on high-resolution data. However,
well-trained models typically exhibit a trade-off in performance between
reduced-resolution and full-resolution datasets. In this paper, we delve into
the Wald protocol and find that its inaccurate approximation of real-world
degradation patterns limits the generalization of deep pansharpening models. To
address this issue, we propose the Progressive Alignment Degradation Module
(PADM), which uses mutual iteration between two sub-networks, PAlignNet and
PDegradeNet, to adaptively learn accurate degradation processes without relying
on predefined operators. Building on this, we introduce HFreqdiff, which embeds
high-frequency details into a diffusion framework and incorporates CFB and BACM
modules for frequency-selective detail extraction and precise reverse process
learning. These innovations enable effective integration of high-resolution
panchromatic and multispectral images, significantly enhancing spatial
sharpness and quality. Experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the
proposed method's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

Motivation: 现有视觉码本方法要么词汇量小（缺乏细粒度语义），要么盲目扩展导致标记利用率低和训练不稳定。

Method: 通过聚类数百万SigLIP序列嵌入构建500K条目的码本，采用级联设计（冻结码本锚定嵌入空间，可训练码本细化任务语义）。

Result: UniCode^2在多样化基准测试中表现优异，支持高质量视觉合成，且保持了稳定性、语义对齐和模块化。

Conclusion: UniCode^2证明了在不牺牲稳定性、语义或模块化的情况下扩展视觉标记空间的可行性。

Abstract: Unified multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promise in
jointly advancing multimodal understanding and generation, with visual
codebooks discretizing images into tokens for autoregressive modeling. Existing
codebook-based methods either rely on small vocabularies (~16K entries) that
lack fine-grained semantics or naively scale up, resulting in low token
utilization and unstable training. We propose UniCode$^2$, a cascaded codebook
framework enabling large-scale, semantically aligned, and stable visual
tokenization. By clustering millions of SigLIP sequence embeddings, we build a
500K-entry codebook that preserves vision-language alignment while expanding
capacity. Stability is ensured via a cascaded design: a frozen codebook anchors
the embedding space, and a trainable codebook refines task-specific semantics.
This decoupling promotes high utilization and robust learning. Moreover, the
alignment of our visual tokens with textual semantics enables seamless
integration with pretrained diffusion decoders, supporting high-quality visual
synthesis with minimal adaptation. UniCode^2 delivers strong performance across
diverse benchmarks, demonstrating the viability of scaling visual token spaces
without sacrificing stability, semantics, or modularity.

Result: 仿真结果表明，该方案在重建质量和去模糊性能上优于传统系统。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效优化了带宽利用并提升了性能。

Abstract: Event cameras asynchronously capture pixel-level intensity changes with
extremely low latency. They are increasingly used in conjunction with RGB
cameras for a wide range of vision-related applications. However, a major
challenge in these hybrid systems lies in the transmission of the large volume
of triggered events and RGB images. To address this, we propose a transmission
scheme that retains efficient reconstruction performance of both sources while
accomplishing real-time deblurring in parallel. Conventional RGB cameras and
event cameras typically capture the same scene in different ways, often
resulting in significant redundant information across their outputs. To address
this, we develop a joint event and image (E-I) transmission framework to
eliminate redundancy and thereby optimize channel bandwidth utilization. Our
approach employs Bayesian modeling and the information bottleneck method to
disentangle the shared and domain-specific information within the E-I inputs.
This disentangled information bottleneck framework ensures both the compactness
and informativeness of extracted shared and domain-specific information.
Moreover, it adaptively allocates transmission bandwidth based on scene
dynamics, i.e., more symbols are allocated to events for dynamic details or to
images for static information. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed
scheme not only achieves superior reconstruction quality compared to
conventional systems but also delivers enhanced deblurring performance.

Abstract: The complexity and diversity of surgical workflows, driven by heterogeneous
operating room settings, institutional protocols, and anatomical variability,
present a significant challenge in developing generalizable models for
cross-institutional and cross-procedural surgical understanding. While recent
surgical foundation models pretrained on large-scale vision-language data offer
promising transferability, their zero-shot performance remains constrained by
domain shifts, limiting their utility in unseen surgical environments. To
address this, we introduce Surgical Phase Anywhere (SPA), a lightweight
framework for versatile surgical workflow understanding that adapts foundation
models to institutional settings with minimal annotation. SPA leverages
few-shot spatial adaptation to align multi-modal embeddings with
institution-specific surgical scenes and phases. It also ensures temporal
consistency through diffusion modeling, which encodes task-graph priors derived
from institutional procedure protocols. Finally, SPA employs dynamic test-time
adaptation, exploiting the mutual agreement between multi-modal phase
prediction streams to adapt the model to a given test video in a
self-supervised manner, enhancing the reliability under test-time distribution
shifts. SPA is a lightweight adaptation framework, allowing hospitals to
rapidly customize phase recognition models by defining phases in natural
language text, annotating a few images with the phase labels, and providing a
task graph defining phase transitions. The experimental results show that the
SPA framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in few-shot surgical phase
recognition across multiple institutions and procedures, even outperforming
full-shot models with 32-shot labeled data. Code is available at

Conclusion: 多模态早期融合能有效提升手写识别性能，且具有更强的书写独立性。

Abstract: We posit that handwriting recognition benefits from complementary cues
carried by the rasterized complex glyph and the pen's trajectory, yet most
systems exploit only one modality. We introduce an end-to-end network that
performs early fusion of offline images and online stroke data within a shared
latent space. A patch encoder converts the grayscale crop into fixed-length
visual tokens, while a lightweight transformer embeds the $(x, y, \text{pen})$
sequence. Learnable latent queries attend jointly to both token streams,
yielding context-enhanced stroke embeddings that are pooled and decoded under a
cross-entropy loss objective. Because integration occurs before any high-level
classification, temporal cues reinforce each other during representation
learning, producing stronger writer independence. Comprehensive experiments on
IAMOn-DB and VNOn-DB demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art
accuracy, exceeding previous bests by up to 1\%. Our study also shows
adaptation of this pipeline with gesturification on the ISI-Air dataset. Our

Conclusion: HMDRN通过双层次重建增强类间区分能力，掩码增强减少类内差异，可视化结果证明了其优越的特征重建能力。

Abstract: Few-shot fine-grained image classification (FS-FGIC) presents a significant
challenge, requiring models to distinguish visually similar subclasses with
limited labeled examples. Existing methods have critical limitations:
metric-based methods lose spatial information and misalign local features,
while reconstruction-based methods fail to utilize hierarchical feature
information and lack mechanisms to focus on discriminative regions. We propose
the Hierarchical Mask-enhanced Dual Reconstruction Network (HMDRN), which
integrates dual-layer feature reconstruction with mask-enhanced feature
processing to improve fine-grained classification. HMDRN incorporates a
dual-layer feature reconstruction and fusion module that leverages
complementary visual information from different network hierarchies. Through
learnable fusion weights, the model balances high-level semantic
representations from the last layer with mid-level structural details from the
penultimate layer. Additionally, we design a spatial binary mask-enhanced
transformer self-reconstruction module that processes query features through
adaptive thresholding while maintaining complete support features, enhancing
focus on discriminative regions while filtering background noise. Extensive
experiments on three challenging fine-grained datasets demonstrate that HMDRN
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across Conv-4 and ResNet-12
backbone architectures. Comprehensive ablation studies validate the
effectiveness of each proposed component, revealing that dual-layer
reconstruction enhances inter-class discrimination while mask-enhanced
transformation reduces intra-class variations. Visualization results provide
evidence of HMDRN's superior feature reconstruction capabilities.

Abstract: The study of canvas fabrics in works of art is a crucial tool for
authentication, attribution and conservation. Traditional methods are based on
thread density map matching, which cannot be applied when canvases do not come
from contiguous positions on a roll. This paper presents a novel approach based
on deep learning to assess the similarity of textiles. We introduce an
automatic tool that evaluates the similarity between canvases without relying
on thread density maps. A Siamese deep learning model is designed and trained
to compare pairs of images by exploiting the feature representations learned
from the scans. In addition, a similarity estimation method is proposed,
aggregating predictions from multiple pairs of cloth samples to provide a
robust similarity score. Our approach is applied to canvases from the Museo
Nacional del Prado, corroborating the hypothesis that plain weave canvases,
widely used in painting, can be effectively compared even when their thread
densities are similar. The results demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of
the proposed method, opening new avenues for the analysis of masterpieces.

Method: 引入DenseWorld基准和DenseDiT方法，利用生成模型的视觉先验，通过参数复用和轻量级分支实现多尺度上下文整合。

Result: DenseDiT在DenseWorld上表现优异，仅需基线0.01%的训练数据，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Dense prediction tasks hold significant importance of computer vision, aiming
to learn pixel-wise annotated label for an input image. Despite advances in
this field, existing methods primarily focus on idealized conditions, with
limited generalization to real-world scenarios and facing the challenging
scarcity of real-world data. To systematically study this problem, we first
introduce DenseWorld, a benchmark spanning a broad set of 25 dense prediction
tasks that correspond to urgent real-world applications, featuring unified
evaluation across tasks. Then, we propose DenseDiT, which maximally exploits
generative models' visual priors to perform diverse real-world dense prediction
tasks through a unified strategy. DenseDiT combines a parameter-reuse mechanism
and two lightweight branches that adaptively integrate multi-scale context,
working with less than 0.1% additional parameters. Evaluations on DenseWorld
reveal significant performance drops in existing general and specialized
baselines, highlighting their limited real-world generalization. In contrast,
DenseDiT achieves superior results using less than 0.01% training data of
baselines, underscoring its practical value for real-world deployment. Our

*Kunjing Yang,Libin Zheng,Minru Bai,Ting Lu,Leyuan Fang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种从光谱域解决未注册高光谱图像（HSI）和多光谱图像（MSI）融合问题的方法，通过轻量级光谱先验学习（SPL）网络和盲稀疏融合（BSF）方法，提高了注册和融合效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过空间变换对齐HSI和MSI，但由于空间分辨率差异大，效果不佳且耗时。因此，从光谱域解决问题更具优势。

Method: 1. 使用SPL网络提取HSI的光谱特征并增强MSI的光谱分辨率；2. 通过子空间表示和循环训练策略提高注册HSI的光谱精度；3. 提出BSF方法，利用组稀疏正则化等效促进图像低秩性；4. 使用PAO算法求解BSF模型。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据集上的实验验证了该方法在注册和融合中的有效性，并提升了分类性能。

Conclusion: 从光谱域解决注册问题的方法更高效，且BSF方法降低了计算复杂度，同时提高了融合和分类效果。

Abstract: The blind fusion of unregistered hyperspectral images (HSIs) and
multispectral images (MSIs) has attracted growing attention recently. To
address the registration challenge, most existing methods employ spatial
transformations on the HSI to achieve alignment with the MSI. However, due to
the substantial differences in spatial resolution of the images, the
performance of these methods is often unsatisfactory. Moreover, the
registration process tends to be time-consuming when dealing with large-sized
images in remote sensing. To address these issues, we propose tackling the
registration problem from the spectral domain. Initially, a lightweight
Spectral Prior Learning (SPL) network is developed to extract spectral features
from the HSI and enhance the spectral resolution of the MSI. Following this,
the obtained image undergoes spatial downsampling to produce the registered
HSI. In this process, subspace representation and cyclic training strategy are
employed to improve spectral accuracy of the registered HSI obtained. Next, we
propose a blind sparse fusion (BSF) method, which utilizes group sparsity
regularization to equivalently promote the low-rankness of the image. This
approach not only circumvents the need for rank estimation, but also reduces
computational complexity. Then, we employ the Proximal Alternating Optimization
(PAO) algorithm to solve the BSF model, and present its convergence analysis.
Finally, extensive numerical experiments on simulated and real datasets are
conducted to verify the effectiveness of our method in registration and fusion.
We also demonstrate its efficacy in enhancing classification performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Ctrl-Z Sampling的新采样策略，用于在条件生成中检测并逃离局部最优解，提升生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在条件生成中易陷入局部最优解，导致全局不一致或条件不匹配的问题。

Method: 通过奖励模型识别局部最大值，注入噪声并回退到更早状态以逃离局部最优，动态交替进行前向优化和后向探索。

Result: 实验表明，Ctrl-Z Sampling显著提升了生成质量，仅增加约7.6倍的函数评估次数。

Conclusion: Ctrl-Z Sampling是一种模型无关的方法，可兼容现有扩散框架，有效提升生成对齐性和视觉质量。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown strong performance in conditional generation by
progressively denoising Gaussian noise toward a target data distribution. This
denoising process can be interpreted as a form of hill climbing in a learned
latent space, where the model iteratively refines the sample toward regions of
higher probability. However, diffusion models often converge to local optima
that are locally visually coherent yet globally inconsistent or conditionally
misaligned, due to latent space complexity and suboptimal initialization. Prior
efforts attempted to address this by strengthening guidance signals or
manipulating the initial noise distribution. We introduce Controlled Random
Zigzag Sampling (Ctrl-Z Sampling), a novel sampling strategy designed to detect
and escape such local maxima during conditional generation. The method first
identifies potential local maxima using a reward model. Upon detection, it
injects noise and reverts to a previous, noisier state to escape the current
optimization plateau. The reward model then evaluates candidate trajectories,
accepting only those that offer improvement, while progressively deeper retreat
enables stronger escapes when nearby alternatives fail. This controlled random
zigzag process allows dynamic alternation between forward refinement and
backward exploration, enhancing both alignment and visual quality in the
generated outputs. The proposed Ctrl-Z Sampling is model-agnostic and
compatible with existing diffusion frameworks. Experimental results show that
Ctrl-Z Sampling substantially improves generation quality with only around 7.6X
increase in function evaluations.

Abstract: Images captured in challenging environments often experience various forms of
degradation, including noise, color cast, blur, and light scattering. These
effects significantly reduce image quality, hindering their applicability in
downstream tasks such as object detection, mapping, and classification. Our
transformer-based diffusion model was developed to address image restoration
tasks, aiming to improve the quality of degraded images. This model was
evaluated against existing deep learning methodologies across multiple quality
metrics for underwater image enhancement, denoising, and deraining on publicly
available datasets. Our findings demonstrate that the diffusion model, combined
with transformers, surpasses current methods in performance. The results of our
model highlight the efficacy of diffusion models and transformers in improving
the quality of degraded images, consequently expanding their utility in
downstream tasks that require high-fidelity visual data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统放射组学方法使用固定的特征集，无法充分反映个体病理差异，导致性能受限。本文旨在通过个性化特征选择提升诊断效果和可解释性。

Method: 提出放射组学指纹框架，利用深度学习模型动态为每位患者选择相关特征，并结合低维逻辑回归进行分类。

Result: 在多种膝关节疾病诊断任务中表现优于或媲美端到端深度学习模型，同时提供了临床可解释性。

Conclusion: 个性化放射组学特征选择不仅提升了诊断性能，还为临床提供了可解释的见解和潜在生物标志物。

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of knee MRI scans relies on expert clinical judgment,
often with high variability and limited scalability. Existing radiomic
approaches use a fixed set of radiomic features (the signature), selected at
the population level and applied uniformly to all patients. While
interpretable, these signatures are often too constrained to represent
individual pathological variations. As a result, conventional radiomic-based
approaches are found to be limited in performance, compared with recent
end-to-end deep learning (DL) alternatives without using interpretable radiomic
features. We argue that the individual-agnostic nature in current radiomic
selection is not central to its intepretability, but is responsible for the
poor generalization in our application. Here, we propose a novel radiomic
fingerprint framework, in which a radiomic feature set (the fingerprint) is
dynamically constructed for each patient, selected by a DL model. Unlike the
existing radiomic signatures, our fingerprints are derived on a per-patient
basis by predicting the feature relevance in a large radiomic feature pool, and
selecting only those that are predictive of clinical conditions for individual
patients. The radiomic-selecting model is trained simultaneously with a
low-dimensional (considered relatively explainable) logistic regression for
downstream classification. We validate our methods across multiple diagnostic
tasks including general knee abnormalities, anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)
tears, and meniscus tears, demonstrating comparable or superior diagnostic
accuracy relative to state-of-the-art end-to-end DL models. More importantly,
we show that the interpretability inherent in our approach facilitates
meaningful clinical insights and potential biomarker discovery, with detailed
discussion, quantitative and qualitative analysis of real-world clinical cases
to evidence these advantages.

TL;DR: 论文研究了集合式人脸识别（SFR）中的“突发性”现象，即某些元素在集合中出现频率过高，导致性能下降。作者提出了三种检测方法，并通过实验证明抑制突发性可显著提升识别性能。


<details>

Motivation: 突发性现象在SFR中普遍存在，导致训练集泛化能力差和评估集相似性比较干扰，影响识别性能。

Method: 提出基于Quickshift++、特征自相似性和广义最大池化（GMP）的三种策略检测突发性人脸，并在训练和评估阶段调整采样比例或贡献。此外，提出质量感知GMP以增强对低质量人脸的鲁棒性。

Result: 实验证明突发性广泛存在，抑制突发性能显著提升识别性能。

Conclusion: 突发性是SFR中的重要问题，通过检测和抑制突发性可以有效提升识别性能。

Abstract: Burstiness, a phenomenon observed in text and image retrieval, refers to that
particular elements appear more times in a set than a statistically independent
model assumes. We argue that in the context of set-based face recognition
(SFR), burstiness exists widely and degrades the performance in two aspects:
Firstly, the bursty faces, where faces with particular attributes %exist
frequently in a face set, dominate the training instances and dominate the
training face sets and lead to poor generalization ability to unconstrained
scenarios. Secondly, the bursty faces %dominating the evaluation sets interfere
with the similarity comparison in set verification and identification when
evaluation. To detect the bursty faces in a set, we propose three strategies
based on Quickshift++, feature self-similarity, and generalized max-pooling
(GMP). We apply the burst detection results on training and evaluation stages
to enhance the sampling ratios or contributions of the infrequent faces. When
evaluation, we additionally propose the quality-aware GMP that enables
awareness of the face quality and robustness to the low-quality faces for the
original GMP. We give illustrations and extensive experiments on the SFR
benchmarks to demonstrate that burstiness is widespread and suppressing
burstiness considerably improves the recognition performance.

*Sergio Torres Aguilar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文评估了五种目标检测架构在三个历史文档数据集上的性能，发现基于CNN的YOLOv11x-OBB在复杂数据集上表现最佳，而Transformer模型在结构化布局中更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史文档的复杂布局分析（DLA）对自动化处理至关重要，但现有方法在非笛卡尔布局上的表现尚不明确。

Method: 在三个数据集（e-NDP、CATMuS、HORAE）上测试了五种模型（Co-DETR、Grounding DINO、YOLO-AABB、YOLO-OBB、YOLO-World）。

Result: Co-DETR在结构化数据集e-NDP上表现最佳（0.752 mAP），而YOLOv11x-OBB在复杂数据集CATMuS和HORAE上领先（0.564和0.568）。

Conclusion: OBB对历史文档分析至关重要，Transformer和CNN-OBB模型在不同场景下各有优势。

Abstract: Robust Document Layout Analysis (DLA) is critical for the automated
processing and understanding of historical documents with complex page
organizations. This paper benchmarks five state-of-the-art object detection
architectures on three annotated datasets representing a spectrum of
codicological complexity: The e-NDP, a corpus of Parisian medieval registers
(1326-1504); CATMuS, a diverse multiclass dataset derived from various medieval
and modern sources (ca.12th-17th centuries) and HORAE, a corpus of decorated
books of hours (ca.13th-16th centuries). We evaluate two Transformer-based
models (Co-DETR, Grounding DINO) against three YOLO variants (AABB, OBB, and
YOLO-World). Our findings reveal significant performance variations dependent
on model architecture, data set characteristics, and bounding box
representation. In the e-NDP dataset, Co-DETR achieves state-of-the-art results
(0.752 mAP@.50:.95), closely followed by YOLOv11X-OBB (0.721). Conversely, on
the more complex CATMuS and HORAE datasets, the CNN-based YOLOv11x-OBB
significantly outperforms all other models (0.564 and 0.568, respectively).
This study unequivocally demonstrates that using Oriented Bounding Boxes (OBB)
is not a minor refinement but a fundamental requirement for accurately modeling
the non-Cartesian nature of historical manuscripts. We conclude that a key
trade-off exists between the global context awareness of Transformers, ideal
for structured layouts, and the superior generalization of CNN-OBB models for
visually diverse and complex documents.

Conclusion: 该框架通过多模态特征整合和不确定性建模，显著提升了动作识别的精度和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Understanding human actions in videos requires more than raw pixel analysis;
it relies on high-level semantic reasoning and effective integration of
multimodal features. We propose a deep translational action recognition
framework that enhances recognition accuracy by jointly predicting action
concepts and auxiliary features from RGB video frames. At test time,
hallucination streams infer missing cues, enriching feature representations
without increasing computational overhead. To focus on action-relevant regions
beyond raw pixels, we introduce two novel domain-specific descriptors. Object
Detection Features (ODF) aggregate outputs from multiple object detectors to
capture contextual cues, while Saliency Detection Features (SDF) highlight
spatial and intensity patterns crucial for action recognition. Our framework
seamlessly integrates these descriptors with auxiliary modalities such as
optical flow, Improved Dense Trajectories, skeleton data, and audio cues. It
remains compatible with state-of-the-art architectures, including I3D,
AssembleNet, Video Transformer Network, FASTER, and recent models like VideoMAE
V2 and InternVideo2. To handle uncertainty in auxiliary features, we
incorporate aleatoric uncertainty modeling in the hallucination step and
introduce a robust loss function to mitigate feature noise. Our multimodal
self-supervised action recognition framework achieves state-of-the-art
performance on multiple benchmarks, including Kinetics-400, Kinetics-600, and
Something-Something V2, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing
fine-grained action dynamics.

Conclusion: 该框架在泛化性和鲁棒性上优于现有自监督和深度水印技术。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel deep learning framework for robust image
zero-watermarking based on distortion-invariant feature learning. As a
zero-watermarking scheme, our method leaves the original image unaltered and
learns a reference signature through optimization in the feature space. The
proposed framework consists of two key modules. In the first module, a feature
extractor is trained via noise-adversarial learning to generate representations
that are both invariant to distortions and semantically expressive. This is
achieved by combining adversarial supervision against a distortion
discriminator and a reconstruction constraint to retain image content. In the
second module, we design a learning-based multibit zero-watermarking scheme
where the trained invariant features are projected onto a set of trainable
reference codes optimized to match a target binary message. Extensive
experiments on diverse image datasets and a wide range of distortions show that
our method achieves state-of-the-art robustness in both feature stability and
watermark recovery. Comparative evaluations against existing self-supervised
and deep watermarking techniques further highlight the superiority of our
framework in generalization and robustness.

Conclusion: HiT和DyHiT在速度和性能上取得平衡，动态路由技术可加速其他高性能跟踪器。

Abstract: Transformer-based visual trackers have demonstrated significant advancements
due to their powerful modeling capabilities. However, their practicality is
limited on resource-constrained devices because of their slow processing
speeds. To address this challenge, we present HiT, a novel family of efficient
tracking models that achieve high performance while maintaining fast operation
across various devices. The core innovation of HiT lies in its Bridge Module,
which connects lightweight transformers to the tracking framework, enhancing
feature representation quality. Additionally, we introduce a dual-image
position encoding approach to effectively encode spatial information. HiT
achieves an impressive speed of 61 frames per second (fps) on the NVIDIA Jetson
AGX platform, alongside a competitive AUC of 64.6% on the LaSOT benchmark,
outperforming all previous efficient trackers.Building on HiT, we propose
DyHiT, an efficient dynamic tracker that flexibly adapts to scene complexity by
selecting routes with varying computational requirements. DyHiT uses search
area features extracted by the backbone network and inputs them into an
efficient dynamic router to classify tracking scenarios. Based on the
classification, DyHiT applies a divide-and-conquer strategy, selecting
appropriate routes to achieve a superior trade-off between accuracy and speed.
The fastest version of DyHiT achieves 111 fps on NVIDIA Jetson AGX while
maintaining an AUC of 62.4% on LaSOT.Furthermore, we introduce a training-free
acceleration method based on the dynamic routing architecture of DyHiT. This
method significantly improves the execution speed of various high-performance
trackers without sacrificing accuracy. For instance, our acceleration method
enables the state-of-the-art tracker SeqTrack-B256 to achieve a 2.68 times
speedup on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti GPU while maintaining the same AUC of
69.9% on the LaSOT.

Abstract: Accurate, cost-effective monitoring of plantation aboveground biomass (AGB)
is crucial for supporting local livelihoods and carbon sequestration
initiatives like the China Certified Emission Reduction (CCER) program.
High-resolution canopy height maps (CHMs) are essential for this, but standard
lidar-based methods are expensive. While deep learning with RGB imagery offers
an alternative, accurately extracting canopy height features remains
challenging. To address this, we developed a novel model for high-resolution
CHM generation using a Large Vision Foundation Model (LVFM). Our model
integrates a feature extractor, a self-supervised feature enhancement module to
preserve spatial details, and a height estimator. Tested in Beijing's Fangshan
District using 1-meter Google Earth imagery, our model outperformed existing
methods, including conventional CNNs. It achieved a mean absolute error of 0.09
m, a root mean square error of 0.24 m, and a correlation of 0.78 against
lidar-based CHMs. The resulting CHMs enabled over 90% success in individual
tree detection, high accuracy in AGB estimation, and effective tracking of
plantation growth, demonstrating strong generalization to non-training areas.
This approach presents a promising, scalable tool for evaluating carbon
sequestration in both plantations and natural forests.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as the leading approach for image synthesis,
demonstrating exceptional photorealism and diversity. However, training
diffusion models at high resolutions remains computationally prohibitive, and
existing zero-shot generation techniques for synthesizing images beyond
training resolutions often produce artifacts, including object duplication and
spatial incoherence. In this paper, we introduce HiWave, a training-free,
zero-shot approach that substantially enhances visual fidelity and structural
coherence in ultra-high-resolution image synthesis using pretrained diffusion
models. Our method employs a two-stage pipeline: generating a base image from
the pretrained model followed by a patch-wise DDIM inversion step and a novel
wavelet-based detail enhancer module. Specifically, we first utilize inversion
methods to derive initial noise vectors that preserve global coherence from the
base image. Subsequently, during sampling, our wavelet-domain detail enhancer
retains low-frequency components from the base image to ensure structural
consistency, while selectively guiding high-frequency components to enrich fine
details and textures. Extensive evaluations using Stable Diffusion XL
demonstrate that HiWave effectively mitigates common visual artifacts seen in
prior methods, achieving superior perceptual quality. A user study confirmed
HiWave's performance, where it was preferred over the state-of-the-art
alternative in more than 80% of comparisons, highlighting its effectiveness for
high-quality, ultra-high-resolution image synthesis without requiring
retraining or architectural modifications.

Motivation: 地下矿井中岩锚是支撑系统的关键部件，但传统人工检测方法在低光环境和耗时性方面存在挑战，亟需自动化解决方案。

Method: 采用两阶段深度学习架构DeepBolt，专门针对类别不平衡问题，优化复杂3D点云中的岩锚识别。

Conclusion: DeepBolt在复杂地下环境中表现出色，为岩锚自动化检测提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Rock bolts are crucial components of the subterranean support systems in
underground mines that provide adequate structural reinforcement to the rock
mass to prevent unforeseen hazards like rockfalls. This makes frequent
assessments of such bolts critical for maintaining rock mass stability and
minimising risks in underground mining operations. Where manual surveying of
rock bolts is challenging due to the low light conditions in the underground
mines and the time-intensive nature of the process, automated detection of rock
bolts serves as a plausible solution. To that end, this study focuses on the
automatic identification of rock bolts within medium to large-scale 3D point
clouds obtained from underground mines using mobile laser scanners. Existing
techniques for automated rock bolt identification primarily rely on feature
engineering and traditional machine learning approaches. However, such
techniques lack robustness as these point clouds present several challenges due
to data noise, varying environments, and complex surrounding structures.
Moreover, the target rock bolts are extremely small objects within large-scale
point clouds and are often partially obscured due to the application of
reinforcement shotcrete. Addressing these challenges, this paper proposes an
approach termed DeepBolt, which employs a novel two-stage deep learning
architecture specifically designed for handling severe class imbalance for the
automatic and efficient identification of rock bolts in complex 3D point

Abstract: Periodontitis, a chronic inflammatory disease causing alveolar bone loss,
significantly affects oral health and quality of life. Accurate assessment of
bone loss severity and pattern is critical for diagnosis and treatment
planning. In this study, we propose a novel AI-based deep learning framework to
automatically detect and quantify alveolar bone loss and its patterns using
intraoral periapical (IOPA) radiographs. Our method combines YOLOv8 for tooth
detection with Keypoint R-CNN models to identify anatomical landmarks, enabling
precise calculation of bone loss severity. Additionally, YOLOv8x-seg models
segment bone levels and tooth masks to determine bone loss patterns (horizontal
vs. angular) via geometric analysis. Evaluated on a large, expertly annotated
dataset of 1000 radiographs, our approach achieved high accuracy in detecting
bone loss severity (intra-class correlation coefficient up to 0.80) and bone
loss pattern classification (accuracy 87%). This automated system offers a
rapid, objective, and reproducible tool for periodontal assessment, reducing
reliance on subjective manual evaluation. By integrating AI into dental
radiographic analysis, our framework has the potential to improve early
diagnosis and personalized treatment planning for periodontitis, ultimately
enhancing patient care and clinical outcomes.

TL;DR: PLADA框架通过处理压缩图像的块效应和利用配对与非配对数据，显著提升了OSN中深度伪造图像的检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度伪造检测方法忽视OSN压缩引入的块效应，且主要依赖原始图像，难以应对实际场景。

Method: PLADA包含块效应消除模块（B2E）和开放数据聚合模块（ODA），分别处理块效应和数据不足问题。

Result: 在26个数据集上的实验显示，PLADA在有限数据和压缩条件下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PLADA不仅解决了块效应问题，还为开放世界场景提供了鲁棒的深度伪造检测方案。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of deep learning, particularly through generative
adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models (DMs), AI-generated images, or
``deepfakes", have become nearly indistinguishable from real ones. These images
are widely shared across Online Social Networks (OSNs), raising concerns about
their misuse. Existing deepfake detection methods overlook the ``block effects"
introduced by compression in OSNs, which obscure deepfake artifacts, and
primarily focus on raw images, rarely encountered in real-world scenarios. To
address these challenges, we propose PLADA (Pay Less Attention to Deceptive
Artifacts), a novel framework designed to tackle the lack of paired data and
the ineffective use of compressed images. PLADA consists of two core modules:
Block Effect Eraser (B2E), which uses a dual-stage attention mechanism to
handle block effects, and Open Data Aggregation (ODA), which processes both
paired and unpaired data to improve detection. Extensive experiments across 26
datasets demonstrate that PLADA achieves a remarkable balance in deepfake
detection, outperforming SoTA methods in detecting deepfakes on OSNs, even with
limited paired data and compression. More importantly, this work introduces the
``block effect" as a critical factor in deepfake detection, providing a robust
solution for open-world scenarios. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频检测方法复杂且计算量大，而单帧检测在动态场景中性能受限。

Method: 将连续多帧作为输入，仅监督目标帧输出，保留YOLO架构的轻量化和实时性。

Result: 在MOT20Det和BOAT360数据集上验证了方法的鲁棒性，缩小了轻量模型与复杂模型的差距。

Conclusion: 方法有效利用时间信息，提升检测性能，并贡献了BOAT360数据集支持未来研究。

Abstract: Modern image-based object detection models, such as YOLOv7, primarily process
individual frames independently, thus ignoring valuable temporal context
naturally present in videos. Meanwhile, existing video-based detection methods
often introduce complex temporal modules, significantly increasing model size
and computational complexity. In practical applications such as surveillance
and autonomous driving, transient challenges including motion blur, occlusions,
and abrupt appearance changes can severely degrade single-frame detection
performance. To address these issues, we propose a straightforward yet highly
effective strategy: stacking multiple consecutive frames as input to a
YOLO-based detector while supervising only the output corresponding to a single
target frame. This approach leverages temporal information with minimal
modifications to existing architectures, preserving simplicity, computational
efficiency, and real-time inference capability. Extensive experiments on the
challenging MOT20Det and our BOAT360 datasets demonstrate that our method
improves detection robustness, especially for lightweight models, effectively
narrowing the gap between compact and heavy detection networks. Additionally,
we contribute the BOAT360 benchmark dataset, comprising annotated fisheye video
sequences captured from a boat, to support future research in multi-frame video
object detection in challenging real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: 对抗性掩码图像建模方法有效提升了半监督医学图像分割的性能。

Abstract: Vision Transformer has recently gained tremendous popularity in medical image
segmentation task due to its superior capability in capturing long-range
dependencies. However, transformer requires a large amount of labeled data to
be effective, which hinders its applicability in annotation scarce
semi-supervised learning scenario where only limited labeled data is available.
State-of-the-art semi-supervised learning methods propose combinatorial
CNN-Transformer learning to cross teach a transformer with a convolutional
neural network, which achieves promising results. However, it remains a
challenging task to effectively train the transformer with limited labeled
data. In this paper, we propose an adversarial masked image modeling method to
fully unleash the potential of transformer for semi-supervised medical image
segmentation. The key challenge in semi-supervised learning with transformer
lies in the lack of sufficient supervision signal. To this end, we propose to
construct an auxiliary masked domain from original domain with masked image
modeling and train the transformer to predict the entire segmentation mask with
masked inputs to increase supervision signal. We leverage the original labels
from labeled data and pseudo-labels from unlabeled data to learn the masked
domain. To further benefit the original domain from masked domain, we provide a
theoretical analysis of our method from a multi-domain learning perspective and
devise a novel adversarial training loss to reduce the domain gap between the
original and masked domain, which boosts semi-supervised learning performance.
We also extend adversarial masked image modeling to CNN network. Extensive
experiments on three public medical image segmentation datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method, where our method outperforms existing methods
significantly. Our code is publicly available at

Result: 在ActivityNet Captions数据集上验证了DaS框架的有效性。

Conclusion: DaS框架通过分割与摘要方法成功实现了密集视频字幕生成，表现优异。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a division-and-summarization (DaS) framework for
dense video captioning. After partitioning each untrimmed long video as
multiple event proposals, where each event proposal consists of a set of short
video segments, we extract visual feature (e.g., C3D feature) from each segment
and use the existing image/video captioning approach to generate one sentence
description for this segment. Considering that the generated sentences contain
rich semantic descriptions about the whole event proposal, we formulate the
dense video captioning task as a visual cue aided sentence summarization
problem and propose a new two stage Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) approach
equipped with a new hierarchical attention mechanism to summarize all generated
sentences as one descriptive sentence with the aid of visual features.
Specifically, the first-stage LSTM network takes all semantic words from the
generated sentences and the visual features from all segments within one event
proposal as the input, and acts as the encoder to effectively summarize both
semantic and visual information related to this event proposal. The
second-stage LSTM network takes the output from the first-stage LSTM network
and the visual features from all video segments within one event proposal as
the input, and acts as the decoder to generate one descriptive sentence for
this event proposal. Our comprehensive experiments on the ActivityNet Captions
dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our newly proposed DaS framework for
dense video captioning.

Abstract: Identifiable causal representation learning seeks to uncover the true causal

presents opportunities to improve the generalisability and robustness of
task-specific latent features. This work introduces the concept of grouping
observations to learn identifiable representations for disease classification
in chest X-rays via an end-to-end framework. Our experiments demonstrate that
these causal representations improve generalisability and robustness across
multiple classification tasks when grouping is used to enforce invariance w.r.t

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图的分割与总结（GPaS）框架，通过两阶段方法改进密集视频描述任务，特别关注语义词关系的学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在场景和对象变化较大的事件描述中表现不佳，未充分探索事件时间提议内的场景演变。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：分割阶段将事件提议拆分为更短的视频片段进行描述；总结阶段通过GCN-LSTM交互模块整合语义词关系。

Result: 在ActivityNet Captions和YouCook II数据集上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GPaS框架通过细粒度分割和语义词关系学习显著提升了密集视频描述性能。

Abstract: Recently, dense video captioning has made attractive progress in detecting
and captioning all events in a long untrimmed video. Despite promising results
were achieved, most existing methods do not sufficiently explore the scene
evolution within an event temporal proposal for captioning, and therefore
perform less satisfactorily when the scenes and objects change over a
relatively long proposal. To address this problem, we propose a graph-based
partition-and-summarization (GPaS) framework for dense video captioning within
two stages. For the ``partition" stage, a whole event proposal is split into
short video segments for captioning at a finer level. For the ``summarization"
stage, the generated sentences carrying rich description information for each
segment are summarized into one sentence to describe the whole event. We
particularly focus on the ``summarization" stage, and propose a framework that
effectively exploits the relationship between semantic words for summarization.
We achieve this goal by treating semantic words as nodes in a graph and
learning their interactions by coupling Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and
Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), with the aid of visual cues. Two schemes of
GCN-LSTM Interaction (GLI) modules are proposed for seamless integration of GCN
and LSTM. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated via an extensive
comparison with the state-of-the-arts methods on the two benchmarks ActivityNet
Captions dataset and YouCook II dataset.

Result: 在三个360度数据集上表现优于传统几何方法和其他学习基线，具有更高的准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 深度学习在全向距离估计中具有潜力，适合低成本机器人、自主导航和监控应用。

Abstract: Accurate distance estimation is a fundamental challenge in robotic
perception, particularly in omnidirectional imaging, where traditional
geometric methods struggle with lens distortions and environmental variability.
In this work, we propose a neural network-based approach for monocular distance
estimation using a single 360{\deg} fisheye lens camera. Unlike classical
trigonometric techniques that rely on precise lens calibration, our method
directly learns and infers the distance of objects from raw omnidirectional
inputs, offering greater robustness and adaptability across diverse conditions.
We evaluate our approach on three 360{\deg} datasets (LOAF, ULM360, and a newly
captured dataset Boat360), each representing distinct environmental and sensor
setups. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed learning-based
model outperforms traditional geometry-based methods and other learning
baselines in both accuracy and robustness. These findings highlight the
potential of deep learning for real-time omnidirectional distance estimation,
making our approach particularly well-suited for low-cost applications in
robotics, autonomous navigation, and surveillance.

Conclusion: 展示了无标注高效架构的潜力，挑战了对复杂架构的依赖。

Abstract: The increasing ubiquity of video content and the corresponding demand for
efficient access to meaningful information have elevated video summarization
and video highlights as a vital research area. However, many state-of-the-art
methods depend heavily either on supervised annotations or on attention-based
models, which are computationally expensive and brittle in the face of
distribution shifts that hinder cross-domain applicability across datasets. We
introduce a pioneering self-supervised video summarization model that captures
both spatial and temporal dependencies without the overhead of attention, RNNs,
or transformers. Our framework integrates a novel set of Markov process-driven
loss metrics and a two-stage self supervised learning paradigm that ensures
both performance and efficiency. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the SUMME and TVSUM datasets, outperforming all existing
unsupervised methods. It also rivals the best supervised models, demonstrating
the potential for efficient, annotation-free architectures. This paves the way
for more generalizable video summarization techniques and challenges the
prevailing reliance on complex architectures.

Result: 实验表明，WonderFree显著提升了渲染质量和全局一致性，用户研究中77.20%偏好优于基线模型。

Conclusion: WonderFree为3D场景生成提供了高质量、一致性的探索体验，代码和模型将开源。

Abstract: Interactive 3D scene generation from a single image has gained significant
attention due to its potential to create immersive virtual worlds. However, a
key challenge in current 3D generation methods is the limited explorability,
which cannot render high-quality images during larger maneuvers beyond the
original viewpoint, particularly when attempting to move forward into unseen
areas. To address this challenge, we propose WonderFree, the first model that
enables users to interactively generate 3D worlds with the freedom to explore
from arbitrary angles and directions. Specifically, we decouple this challenge
into two key subproblems: novel view quality, which addresses visual artifacts
and floating issues in novel views, and cross-view consistency, which ensures
spatial consistency across different viewpoints. To enhance rendering quality
in novel views, we introduce WorldRestorer, a data-driven video restoration
model designed to eliminate floaters and artifacts. In addition, a data
collection pipeline is presented to automatically gather training data for
WorldRestorer, ensuring it can handle scenes with varying styles needed for 3D
scene generation. Furthermore, to improve cross-view consistency, we propose
ConsistView, a multi-view joint restoration mechanism that simultaneously
restores multiple perspectives while maintaining spatiotemporal coherence.
Experimental results demonstrate that WonderFree not only enhances rendering
quality across diverse viewpoints but also significantly improves global
coherence and consistency. These improvements are confirmed by CLIP-based
metrics and a user study showing a 77.20% preference for WonderFree over
WonderWorld enabling a seamless and immersive 3D exploration experience. The
code, model, and data will be publicly available.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence is producing fake
remote sensing imagery (RSI) that is increasingly difficult to detect,
potentially leading to erroneous intelligence, fake news, and even conspiracy
theories. Existing forgery detection methods typically rely on single visual
features to capture predefined artifacts, such as spatial-domain cues to detect
forged objects like roads or buildings in RSI, or frequency-domain features to
identify artifacts from up-sampling operations in adversarial generative
networks (GANs). However, the nature of artifacts can significantly differ
depending on geographic terrain, land cover types, or specific features within
the RSI. Moreover, these complex artifacts evolve as generative models become
more sophisticated. In short, over-reliance on a single visual cue makes
existing forgery detectors struggle to generalize across diverse remote sensing
data. This paper proposed a novel forgery detection framework called SFNet,
designed to identify fake images in diverse remote sensing data by leveraging
spatial and frequency domain features. Specifically, to obtain rich and
comprehensive visual information, SFNet employs two independent feature
extractors to capture spatial and frequency domain features from input RSIs. To
fully utilize the complementary domain features, the domain feature mapping
module and the hybrid domain feature refinement module(CBAM attention) of SFNet
are designed to successively align and fuse the multi-domain features while
suppressing redundant information. Experiments on three datasets show that
SFNet achieves an accuracy improvement of 4%-15.18% over the state-of-the-art
RS forgery detection methods and exhibits robust generalization capabilities.

Method: VIPScene结合视频生成、前馈3D重建和开放词汇感知模型，通过文本和图像提示分析场景中的对象，并引入FPVScore评估一致性和合理性。

Conclusion: VIPScene为3D场景合成提供了高真实性和一致性的解决方案，代码将开源。

Abstract: Traditionally, 3D scene synthesis requires expert knowledge and significant
manual effort. Automating this process could greatly benefit fields such as
architectural design, robotics simulation, virtual reality, and gaming. Recent
approaches to 3D scene synthesis often rely on the commonsense reasoning of
large language models (LLMs) or strong visual priors of modern image generation
models. However, current LLMs demonstrate limited 3D spatial reasoning ability,
which restricts their ability to generate realistic and coherent 3D scenes.
Meanwhile, image generation-based methods often suffer from constraints in
viewpoint selection and multi-view inconsistencies. In this work, we present
Video Perception models for 3D Scene synthesis (VIPScene), a novel framework
that exploits the encoded commonsense knowledge of the 3D physical world in
video generation models to ensure coherent scene layouts and consistent object
placements across views. VIPScene accepts both text and image prompts and
seamlessly integrates video generation, feedforward 3D reconstruction, and
open-vocabulary perception models to semantically and geometrically analyze
each object in a scene. This enables flexible scene synthesis with high realism
and structural consistency. For more precise analysis, we further introduce
First-Person View Score (FPVScore) for coherence and plausibility evaluation,
utilizing continuous first-person perspective to capitalize on the reasoning
ability of multimodal large language models. Extensive experiments show that
VIPScene significantly outperforms existing methods and generalizes well across
diverse scenarios. The code will be released.

diffusion model and seamlessly blends it into the original scene to generate
visually coherent and spatially consistent compositions. We evaluated
Shape2Animal on a diverse set of real-world inputs, demonstrating its

Abstract: Obtaining a better knowledge of the current state and behavior of objects
orbiting Earth has proven to be essential for a range of applications such as
active debris removal, in-orbit maintenance, or anomaly detection. 3D models
represent a valuable source of information in the field of Space Situational
Awareness (SSA). In this work, we leveraged Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to
perform 3D reconstruction of non-cooperative space objects from simulated
images. This scenario is challenging for NeRF models due to unusual camera
characteristics and environmental conditions : mono-chromatic images, unknown
object orientation, limited viewing angles, absence of diffuse lighting etc. In
this work we focus primarly on the joint optimization of camera poses alongside
the NeRF. Our experimental results show that the most accurate 3D
reconstruction is achieved when training with successive images one-by-one. We
estimate camera poses by optimizing an uniform rotation and use regularization
to prevent successive poses from being too far apart.

Abstract: Microscopy image analysis is fundamental for different applications, from
diagnosis to synthetic engineering and environmental monitoring. Modern
acquisition systems have granted the possibility to acquire an escalating
amount of images, requiring a consequent development of a large collection of
deep learning-based automatic image analysis methods. Although deep neural
networks have demonstrated great performance in this field, interpretability,
an essential requirement for microscopy image analysis, remains an open
challenge.
  This work proposes a Disentangled Representation Learning (DRL) methodology
to enhance model interpretability for microscopy image classification.
Exploiting benchmark datasets from three different microscopic image domains
(plankton, yeast vacuoles, and human cells), we show how a DRL framework, based
on transferring a representation learnt from synthetic data, can provide a good
trade-off between accuracy and interpretability in this domain.

TL;DR: MMSearch-R1是一个端到端的强化学习框架，用于优化大型多模态模型（LMMs）在现实互联网环境中的多轮搜索行为，减少搜索调用并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界信息的复杂性和动态性要求LMMs能够高效访问外部知识源，现有方法如RAG和提示工程搜索代理效率低下。

Method: 提出MMSearch-R1框架，结合图像和文本搜索工具，通过基于结果的奖励和搜索惩罚指导模型进行按需搜索。

Result: 在知识密集和信息寻求任务中，MMSearch-R1性能优于同规模RAG基线，并减少30%以上的搜索调用。

Conclusion: MMSearch-R1为多模态搜索研究提供了高效且按需的解决方案，并提供了可操作的见解。

Abstract: Robust deployment of large multimodal models (LMMs) in real-world scenarios
requires access to external knowledge sources, given the complexity and dynamic
nature of real-world information. Existing approaches such as
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and prompt engineered search agents rely
on rigid pipelines, often leading to inefficient or excessive search behaviors.
We present MMSearch-R1, the first end-to-end reinforcement learning framework
that enables LMMs to perform on-demand, multi-turn search in real-world
Internet environments. Our framework integrates both image and text search
tools, allowing the model to reason about when and how to invoke them guided by
an outcome-based reward with a search penalty. To support training, We collect
a multimodal search VQA dataset through a semi-automated pipeline that covers
diverse visual and textual knowledge needs and curate a search-balanced subset
with both search-required and search-free samples, which proves essential for
shaping efficient and on-demand search behavior. Extensive experiments on
knowledge-intensive and info-seeking VQA tasks show that our model not only
outperforms RAG-based baselines of the same model size, but also matches the
performance of a larger RAG-based model while reducing search calls by over
30%. We further analyze key empirical findings to offer actionable insights for
advancing research in multimodal search.

TL;DR: IPFormer提出了一种基于视觉的3D全景场景补全方法，通过动态实例提案和注意力机制提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在测试时静态查询的局限性，提升场景理解的动态适应性。

Method: 利用图像上下文动态初始化实例提案，并通过注意力编码解码优化语义实例-体素关系。

Result: 在PQ$^\dagger$和PQ-All指标上超越现有方法，运行时间减少14倍以上。

Conclusion: 动态实例提案显著提升性能，为视觉3D全景场景补全提供了新思路。

Abstract: Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) has emerged as a pivotal approach for jointly
learning scene geometry and semantics, enabling downstream applications such as
navigation in mobile robotics. The recent generalization to Panoptic Scene
Completion (PSC) advances the SSC domain by integrating instance-level
information, thereby enhancing object-level sensitivity in scene understanding.
While PSC was introduced using LiDAR modality, methods based on camera images
remain largely unexplored. Moreover, recent Transformer-based SSC approaches
utilize a fixed set of learned queries to reconstruct objects within the scene
volume. Although these queries are typically updated with image context during
training, they remain static at test time, limiting their ability to
dynamically adapt specifically to the observed scene. To overcome these
limitations, we propose IPFormer, the first approach that leverages
context-adaptive instance proposals at train and test time to address
vision-based 3D Panoptic Scene Completion. Specifically, IPFormer adaptively
initializes these queries as panoptic instance proposals derived from image
context and further refines them through attention-based encoding and decoding
to reason about semantic instance-voxel relationships. Experimental results
show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods in overall panoptic
metrics PQ$^\dagger$ and PQ-All, matches performance in individual metrics, and
achieves a runtime reduction exceeding 14$\times$. Furthermore, our ablation
studies reveal that dynamically deriving instance proposals from image context,
as opposed to random initialization, leads to a 3.62% increase in PQ-All and a
remarkable average improvement of 18.65% in combined Thing-metrics. These
results highlight our introduction of context-adaptive instance proposals as a
pioneering effort in addressing vision-based 3D Panoptic Scene Completion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 枪击事件频发威胁公共安全，现有枪声检测系统成本高昂，需低成本替代方案。

Method: 利用3459条枪声录音数据集，分析枪声的声学特征，提出SVM和CNN模型进行枪声检测与分类。

Result: CNN模型在干净数据上mAP为0.58，优于SVM的0.39；但在噪声数据上表现下降（mAP 0.35）。

Conclusion: 研究为低成本实时枪声检测系统提供了基础，未来可部署于常见录音设备，助力应急响应。

Abstract: The escalating rates of gun-related violence and mass shootings represent a
significant threat to public safety. Timely and accurate information for law
enforcement agencies is crucial in mitigating these incidents. Current
commercial gunshot detection systems, while effective, often come with
prohibitive costs. This research explores a cost-effective alternative by
leveraging acoustic analysis of gunshot recordings, potentially obtainable from
ubiquitous devices like cell phones, to not only detect gunshots but also
classify the type of firearm used. This paper details a study on deciphering
gun type hierarchies using a curated dataset of 3459 recordings. We investigate
the fundamental acoustic characteristics of gunshots, including muzzle blasts
and shockwaves, which vary based on firearm type, ammunition, and shooting
direction. We propose and evaluate machine learning frameworks, including
Support Vector Machines (SVMs) as a baseline and a more advanced Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) architecture for joint gunshot detection and gun type
classification. Results indicate that our deep learning approach achieves a
mean average precision (mAP) of 0.58 on clean labeled data, outperforming the
SVM baseline (mAP 0.39). Challenges related to data quality, environmental
noise, and the generalization capabilities when using noisy web-sourced data
(mAP 0.35) are also discussed. The long-term vision is to develop a highly
accurate, real-time system deployable on common recording devices,
significantly reducing detection costs and providing critical intelligence to
first responders.

*Stefanos Achlatis,Efstratios Gavves,Jan-Jakob Sonke*

Main category: physics.med-ph

TL;DR: 提出了一种两阶段、物理引导的深度学习管道，用于放射治疗计划自动化，结果接近临床标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 放射治疗需要频繁调整计划以适应解剖变化，深度学习可提供高效自动化解决方案。

Method: 两阶段深度学习管道：第一阶段监督训练MLC和MU值；第二阶段加入预测3D剂量分布的物理引导。

Result: 在133名前列腺癌患者中，方法生成的计划接近临床标准，D95%和V95%差异小，减少危险器官辐射。

Conclusion: 物理引导的深度学习在放射治疗计划中具有潜力。

Abstract: Radiotherapy (RT) is a critical cancer treatment, with volumetric modulated
arc therapy (VMAT) being a commonly used technique that enhances dose
conformity by dynamically adjusting multileaf collimator (MLC) positions and
monitor units (MU) throughout gantry rotation. Adaptive radiotherapy requires
frequent modifications to treatment plans to account for anatomical variations,
necessitating time-efficient solutions. Deep learning offers a promising
solution to automate this process. To this end, we propose a two-stage,
physics-guided deep learning pipeline for radiotherapy planning. In the first
stage, our network is trained with direct supervision on treatment plan
parameters, consisting of MLC and MU values. In the second stage, we
incorporate an additional supervision signal derived from the predicted 3D dose
distribution, integrating physics-based guidance into the training process. We
train and evaluate our approach on 133 prostate cancer patients treated with a
uniform 2-arc VMAT protocol delivering a dose of 62 Gy to the planning target
volume (PTV). Our results demonstrate that the proposed approach, implemented
using both 3D U-Net and UNETR architectures, consistently produces treatment
plans that closely match clinical ground truths. Our method achieves a mean
difference of D95% = 0.42 +/- 1.83 Gy and V95% = -0.22 +/- 1.87% at the PTV
while generating dose distributions that reduce radiation exposure to organs at
risk. These findings highlight the potential of physics-guided deep learning in
RT planning.

Result: 研究发现皮层锥体神经元及其代谢型受体可能是意识生成和控制的关键机制。

Conclusion: Cajal的直觉可能是正确的，皮层锥体神经元（“精神细胞”）可能在意识生成中起核心作用。

Abstract: Technological advances in the past decades have begun to enable
neuroscientists to address fundamental questions about consciousness in an
unprecedented way. Here we review remarkable recent progress in our
understanding of cellular-level mechanisms of conscious processing in the
brain. Of particular interest are the cortical pyramidal neurons -- or "psychic
cells" called by Ram\'on y Cajal more than 100 years ago -- which have an
intriguing cellular mechanism that accounts for selective disruption of
feedback signaling in the brain upon anesthetic-induced loss of consciousness.
Importantly, a particular class of metabotropic receptors distributed over the
dendrites of pyramidal cells are highlighted as the key cellular mechanism.
After all, Cajal's instinct over a century ago may turn out to be correct -- we
may have just begun to understand whether and how psychic cells indeed generate
and control our consciousness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着设备上LLM推理需求的增长，能源效率成为主要问题，尤其是电池有限的移动设备。现有工作多关注预填充阶段加速，而忽视了解码阶段的能源问题。

Method: 提出了自适应能源核心选择（AECS）方法，并将其集成到MNN中，形成MNN-AECS系统，无需root权限或操作系统修改即可实现高效解码。

Result: 在5款Android和2款iOS设备上测试5种不同规模的LLM，MNN-AECS平均降低23%能耗且无速度损失；与其他引擎相比，节能39%-78%，速度提升12%-363%。

Conclusion: MNN-AECS是首个无需系统修改即可显著提升LLM解码能源效率的引擎级解决方案，适用于移动设备。

Abstract: As the demand for on-device Large Language Model (LLM) inference grows,
energy efficiency has become a major concern, especially for battery-limited
mobile devices. Our analysis shows that the memory-bound LLM decode phase
dominates energy use, and yet most existing works focus on accelerating the
prefill phase, neglecting energy concerns. We introduce Adaptive Energy-Centric
Core Selection (AECS) and integrate it into MNN to create the energy-efficient
version, MNN-AECS, the first engine-level system solution without requiring
root access or OS modifications for energy-efficient LLM decoding. MNN-AECS is
designed to reduce LLM decoding energy while keeping decode speed within an
acceptable slowdown threshold by dynamically selecting low-power CPU cores.
MNN-AECS is evaluated across 5 Android and 2 iOS devices on 5 popular LLMs of
various sizes. Compared to original MNN, MNN-AECS cuts down energy use by 23%
without slowdown averaged over all 7 devices and 4 datasets. Against other
engines, including llama.cpp, executorch, mllm, and MediaPipe, MNN-AECS
delivers 39% to 78% energy saving and 12% to 363% speedup on average.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 政府企业软件常使用遗留语言（如MUMPS或ALC），现有LLMs对此支持不足，且输入长度受限，需研究其应用效果。

Method: 研究不同代码分块方法对LLMs（如GPT-4o、Claude 3 Sonnet等）生成遗留代码文档质量的影响。

Result: LLMs的分块与专家分块接近，且生成的文档比人类分块更准确（20%）和有用（10%）。

Conclusion: LLMs可替代人类分块，适用于大型代码库的现代化改造。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become essential tools in computer science,
especially for tasks involving code understanding and generation. However,
existing work does not address many of the unique challenges presented by code
written for government applications. In particular, government enterprise
software is often written in legacy languages like MUMPS or assembly language
code (ALC) and the overall token lengths of these systems exceed the context
window size for current commercially available LLMs. Additionally, LLMs are
primarily trained on modern software languages and have undergone limited
testing with legacy languages, making their ability to understand legacy
languages unknown and, hence, an area for empirical study. This paper examines
the application of LLMs in the modernization of legacy government code written
in ALC and MUMPS, addressing the challenges of input limitations. We
investigate various code-chunking methods to optimize the generation of summary
module comments for legacy code files, evaluating the impact of code-chunking
methods on the quality of documentation produced by different LLMs, including
GPT-4o, Claude 3 Sonnet, Mixtral, and Llama 3. Our results indicate that LLMs
can select partition points closely aligned with human expert partitioning. We
also find that chunking approaches have significant impact on downstream tasks
such as documentation generation. LLM-created partitions produce comments that
are up to 20% more factual and up to 10% more useful than when humans create
partitions. Therefore, we conclude that LLMs can be used as suitable
replacements for human partitioning of large codebases during LLM-aided
modernization.

Abstract: This research addresses the time-consuming and error-prone nature of manual
code compliance checking in Building Information Modeling (BIM) by introducing
a Large Language Model (LLM)-driven approach to semi-automate this critical
process. The developed system integrates LLMs such as GPT, Claude, Gemini, and
Llama, with Revit software to interpret building codes, generate Python

building project demonstrated the system's ability to reduce the time and
effort required for compliance checks while improving accuracy. It streamlined
the identification of violations, such as non-compliant room dimensions,
material usage, and object placements, by automatically assessing relationships
and generating actionable reports. Compared to manual methods, the system
eliminated repetitive tasks, simplified complex regulations, and ensured
reliable adherence to standards. By offering a comprehensive, adaptable, and

Motivation: 传统构思方法缺乏对ML特有挑战（如数据依赖性和技术可行性）的支持，导致产品愿景与实际情况脱节。

Method: 基于技术转移模型开发Define-ML，通过静态验证（玩具问题）和动态验证（工业案例）评估其效用和易用性。

Conclusion: Define-ML为ML产品构思提供了开放且验证过的解决方案，结合了敏捷性和技术可行性。

Abstract: [Context] The increasing adoption of machine learning (ML) in software
systems demands specialized ideation approaches that address ML-specific
challenges, including data dependencies, technical feasibility, and alignment
between business objectives and probabilistic system behavior. Traditional
ideation methods like Lean Inception lack structured support for these ML
considerations, which can result in misaligned product visions and unrealistic
expectations. [Goal] This paper presents Define-ML, a framework that extends
Lean Inception with tailored activities - Data Source Mapping, Feature-to-Data
Source Mapping, and ML Mapping - to systematically integrate data and technical
constraints into early-stage ML product ideation. [Method] We developed and
validated Define-ML following the Technology Transfer Model, conducting both
static validation (with a toy problem) and dynamic validation (in a real-world
industrial case study). The analysis combined quantitative surveys with
qualitative feedback, assessing utility, ease of use, and intent of adoption.
[Results] Participants found Define-ML effective for clarifying data concerns,
aligning ML capabilities with business goals, and fostering cross-functional
collaboration. The approach's structured activities reduced ideation ambiguity,
though some noted a learning curve for ML-specific components, which can be
mitigated by expert facilitation. All participants expressed the intention to
adopt Define-ML. [Conclusion] Define-ML provides an openly available, validated
approach for ML product ideation, building on Lean Inception's agility while
aligning features with available data and increasing awareness of technical
feasibility.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D体积数据的复杂性使其难以可视化，而皮层表面渲染提供了更易理解的脑部解剖表示。X-SiT旨在通过可解释的神经网络支持临床决策。

Method: X-SiT结合了原型表面补丁解码器，通过空间对应的皮层原型进行分类，实现了基于案例的推理。

Result: X-SiT在阿尔茨海默病和额颞叶痴呆检测中达到最先进性能，并提供与已知疾病模式一致的原型。

Conclusion: X-SiT为医学图像分析提供了可解释且高性能的解决方案，有助于临床决策和疾病研究。

Abstract: Interpretable models are crucial for supporting clinical decision-making,
driving advances in their development and application for medical images.
However, the nature of 3D volumetric data makes it inherently challenging to
visualize and interpret intricate and complex structures like the cerebral
cortex. Cortical surface renderings, on the other hand, provide a more
accessible and understandable 3D representation of brain anatomy, facilitating
visualization and interactive exploration. Motivated by this advantage and the
widespread use of surface data for studying neurological disorders, we present
the eXplainable Surface Vision Transformer (X-SiT). This is the first
inherently interpretable neural network that offers human-understandable
predictions based on interpretable cortical features. As part of X-SiT, we
introduce a prototypical surface patch decoder for classifying surface patch
embeddings, incorporating case-based reasoning with spatially corresponding
cortical prototypes. The results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in
detecting Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia while additionally
providing informative prototypes that align with known disease patterns and

Conclusion: DreamAnywhere为低成本电影制作等场景提供了高效的原型化工具，模块化设计使其具有高度可定制性。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-3D scene generation have demonstrated significant
potential to transform content creation across multiple industries. Although
the research community has made impressive progress in addressing the
challenges of this complex task, existing methods often generate environments
that are only front-facing, lack visual fidelity, exhibit limited scene
understanding, and are typically fine-tuned for either indoor or outdoor
settings. In this work, we address these issues and propose DreamAnywhere, a
modular system for the fast generation and prototyping of 3D scenes. Our system
synthesizes a 360{\deg} panoramic image from text, decomposes it into
background and objects, constructs a complete 3D representation through hybrid
inpainting, and lifts object masks to detailed 3D objects that are placed in
the virtual environment. DreamAnywhere supports immersive navigation and
intuitive object-level editing, making it ideal for scene exploration, visual
mock-ups, and rapid prototyping -- all with minimal manual modeling. These
features make our system particularly suitable for low-budget movie production,
enabling quick iteration on scene layout and visual tone without the overhead
of traditional 3D workflows. Our modular pipeline is highly customizable as it
allows components to be replaced independently. Compared to current
state-of-the-art text and image-based 3D scene generation approaches,
DreamAnywhere shows significant improvements in coherence in novel view
synthesis and achieves competitive image quality, demonstrating its
effectiveness across diverse and challenging scenarios. A comprehensive user
study demonstrates a clear preference for our method over existing approaches,
validating both its technical robustness and practical usefulness.

Result: 在多种对象类别和编辑场景中表现出色，保持原始对象的结构和外观，且无需手动掩码。

Conclusion: EditP23提供了一种高效、直观的3D编辑方法，具有高保真度和无需掩码的优势。

Abstract: We present EditP23, a method for mask-free 3D editing that propagates 2D
image edits to multi-view representations in a 3D-consistent manner. In
contrast to traditional approaches that rely on text-based prompting or
explicit spatial masks, EditP23 enables intuitive edits by conditioning on a
pair of images: an original view and its user-edited counterpart. These image
prompts are used to guide an edit-aware flow in the latent space of a
pre-trained multi-view diffusion model, allowing the edit to be coherently
propagated across views. Our method operates in a feed-forward manner, without
optimization, and preserves the identity of the original object, in both
structure and appearance. We demonstrate its effectiveness across a range of
object categories and editing scenarios, achieving high fidelity to the source
while requiring no manual masks.

TL;DR: Orbformer是一种新型的可迁移波函数模型，通过预训练解决量子化学中键断裂的多参考性问题，达到化学精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 键断裂的可靠描述是量子化学的主要挑战，传统多参考方法计算成本高且无法利用分子间电子结构的共性。

Method: 采用量子蒙特卡洛与深度神经网络结合的深度QMC方法，预训练Orbformer模型，覆盖22,000个平衡和断裂结构。

Result: Orbformer在未见过分子上微调后，精度与成本比媲美传统方法，在键断裂和Diels-Alder反应中均达到1 kcal/mol的化学精度。

Conclusion: Orbformer实现了通过预训练摊销薛定谔方程求解成本的新范式，为量子化学提供了实用方法。

Abstract: Reliable description of bond breaking remains a major challenge for quantum
chemistry due to the multireferential character of the electronic structure in
dissociating species. Multireferential methods in particular suffer from large
computational cost, which under the normal paradigm has to be paid anew for
each system at a full price, ignoring commonalities in electronic structure
across molecules. Quantum Monte Carlo with deep neural networks (deep QMC)
uniquely offers to exploit such commonalities by pretraining transferable
wavefunction models, but all such attempts were so far limited in scope. Here,
we bring this new paradigm to fruition with Orbformer, a novel transferable
wavefunction model pretrained on 22,000 equilibrium and dissociating structures
that can be fine-tuned on unseen molecules reaching an accuracy-cost ratio
rivalling classical multireferential methods. On established benchmarks as well

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 利用学生可视化笔记本中的设计说明，结合LLM生成问答对，并验证和整理数据集。

Result: 构建了一个捕捉学生可视化设计选择及其原理的数据集。

Conclusion: 该方法为理解可视化设计原理提供了新途径，数据集可用于进一步研究。

Abstract: Prior natural language datasets for data visualization have focused on tasks
such as visualization literacy assessment, insight generation, and
visualization generation from natural language instructions. These studies
often rely on controlled setups with purpose-built visualizations and
artificially constructed questions. As a result, they tend to prioritize the
interpretation of visualizations, focusing on decoding visualizations rather
than understanding their encoding. In this paper, we present a new dataset and
methodology for probing visualization design rationale through natural
language. We leverage a unique source of real-world visualizations and natural
language narratives: literate visualization notebooks created by students as
part of a data visualization course. These notebooks combine visual artifacts
with design exposition, in which students make explicit the rationale behind
their design decisions. We also use large language models (LLMs) to generate
and categorize question-answer-rationale triples from the narratives and
articulations in the notebooks. We then carefully validate the triples and
curate a dataset that captures and distills the visualization design choices
and corresponding rationales of the students.

TL;DR: CopilotLens是一个透明、可解释的AI代码助手框架，通过动态双层界面揭示AI的决策过程，提升开发者对代码生成的理解和信任。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的AI代码助手缺乏解释性，开发者难以理解其决策过程，影响信任和效率。CopilotLens旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 引入CopilotLens框架，通过动态双层界面展示AI的高层计划和代码库上下文，实现透明化解释。

Result: CopilotLens提供了一种透明、可解释的代码生成方式，增强了开发者对AI助手的理解和信任。

Conclusion: CopilotLens为未来代码助手的设计提供了框架，强调推理清晰性而非速度，促进人机协作。

Abstract: AI-powered code assistants are widely used to generate code completions,
significantly boosting developer productivity. However, these tools typically
present suggestions without explaining their rationale, leaving their
decision-making process inscrutable. This opacity hinders developers' ability
to critically evaluate the output, form accurate mental models, and build
calibrated trust in the system. To address this, we introduce CopilotLens, a
novel interactive framework that reframes code completion from a simple
suggestion into a transparent, explainable event. CopilotLens operates as an
explanation layer that reveals the AI agent's "thought process" through a
dynamic two-level interface, surfacing everything from its reconstructed
high-level plans to the specific codebase context influencing the code. This
paper presents the design and rationale of CopilotLens, offering a concrete
framework for building future agentic code assistants that prioritize clarity
of reasoning over speed of suggestion, thereby fostering deeper comprehension
and more robust human-AI collaboration.

*Xuefei Hou,Xizhao Tan*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为'Insight Recall'的新范式，通过上下文触发的个人过去见解检索来支持自我调节学习（SRL），并开发了原型系统Irec。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数字工具在支持元认知反思方面不足，如Spaced Repetition Systems（SRS）和Personal Knowledge Management（PKM）工具存在局限性。

Method: 采用Just-in-Time Adaptive Intervention（JITAI）框架，构建动态知识图谱，结合混合检索引擎和大型语言模型（LLM）进行深度相似性评估，并设计了'Guided Inquiry'模块。

Result: 开发了Irec系统，验证了该范式的可行性，为下一代智能学习系统提供了理论和实践基础。

Conclusion: 论文贡献了一个理论框架和可用系统平台，旨在提升元认知和自我调节能力。

Abstract: The core challenge in learning has shifted from knowledge acquisition to
effective Self-Regulated Learning (SRL): planning, monitoring, and reflecting
on one's learning. Existing digital tools, however, inadequately support
metacognitive reflection. Spaced Repetition Systems (SRS) use de-contextualized
review, overlooking the role of context, while Personal Knowledge Management
(PKM) tools require high manual maintenance.
  To address these challenges, this paper introduces "Insight Recall," a novel
paradigm that conceptualizes the context-triggered retrieval of personal past
insights as a metacognitive scaffold to promote SRL. We formalize this paradigm
using the Just-in-Time Adaptive Intervention (JITAI) framework and implement a
prototype system, Irec, to demonstrate its feasibility. At its core, Irec uses
a dynamic knowledge graph of the user's learning history. When a user faces a
new problem, a hybrid retrieval engine recalls relevant personal "insights."
Subsequently, a large language model (LLM) performs a deep similarity
assessment to filter and present the most relevant scaffold in a just-in-time
manner. To reduce cognitive load, Irec features a human-in-the-loop pipeline
for LLM-based knowledge graph construction. We also propose an optional "Guided
Inquiry" module, where users can engage in a Socratic dialogue with an expert
LLM, using the current problem and recalled insights as context. The
contribution of this paper is a solid theoretical framework and a usable system
platform for designing next-generation intelligent learning systems that
enhance metacognition and self-regulation.

Motivation: 探讨AI写作支持工具如何影响学生的写作自主性和内容深度，以解决ChatGPT等技术可能带来的负面影响。

Method: 通过随机对照试验，比较了聊天式LLM助手、集成AI写作工具和标准写作界面对90名本科生写作的影响。

Result: 集成AI工具显著提升了学生的写作自主性和知识转化深度。

Conclusion: 针对写作过程特定方面设计的AI支持工具能帮助学生保持对作品的所有权，同时提升内容参与度。

Abstract: The ubiquity of technologies like ChatGPT has raised concerns about their
impact on student writing, particularly regarding reduced learner agency and
superficial engagement with content. While standalone chat-based LLMs often
produce suboptimal writing outcomes, evidence suggests that purposefully
designed AI writing support tools can enhance the writing process. This paper
investigates how different AI support approaches affect writers' sense of
agency and depth of knowledge transformation. Through a randomized control
trial with 90 undergraduate students, we compare three conditions: (1) a
chat-based LLM writing assistant, (2) an integrated AI writing tool to support
diverse subprocesses, and (3) a standard writing interface (control). Our
findings demonstrate that, among AI-supported conditions, students using the
integrated AI writing tool exhibited greater agency over their writing process
and engaged in deeper knowledge transformation overall. These results suggest
that thoughtfully designed AI writing support targeting specific aspects of the
writing process can help students maintain ownership of their work while
facilitating improved engagement with content.

Method: 14个跨学科团队使用多种AI模型（如ChatGPT、Gemini、Claude）进行单日研究，结合提示工程和迭代优化。

Result: LLMs在早期探索、文献综述和工作流设计方面表现优异，但在新材料设计和高级代码生成方面存在局限。

Conclusion: AI可作为核能研究的补充工具，但需进一步开发核能专用数据集和模型，以加速研究并保持科学严谨性。

Abstract: The AI for Nuclear Energy workshop at Oak Ridge National Laboratory evaluated
the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to accelerate fusion and fission
research. Fourteen interdisciplinary teams explored diverse nuclear science
challenges using ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and other AI models over a single
day. Applications ranged from developing foundation models for fusion reactor
control to automating Monte Carlo simulations, predicting material degradation,
and designing experimental programs for advanced reactors. Teams employed
structured workflows combining prompt engineering, deep research capabilities,
and iterative refinement to generate hypotheses, prototype code, and research
strategies. Key findings demonstrate that LLMs excel at early-stage
exploration, literature synthesis, and workflow design, successfully
identifying research gaps and generating plausible experimental frameworks.
However, significant limitations emerged, including difficulties with novel
materials designs, advanced code generation for modeling and simulation, and
domain-specific details requiring expert validation. The successful outcomes
resulted from expert-driven prompt engineering and treating AI as a
complementary tool rather than a replacement for physics-based methods. The
workshop validated AI's potential to accelerate nuclear energy research through
rapid iteration and cross-disciplinary synthesis while highlighting the need
for curated nuclear-specific datasets, workflow automation, and specialized
model development. These results provide a roadmap for integrating AI tools
into nuclear science workflows, potentially reducing development cycles for
safer, more efficient nuclear energy systems while maintaining rigorous
scientific standards.

Abstract: Peer-to-peer trading and the move to decentralized grids have reshaped the
energy markets in the United States. Notwithstanding, such developments lead to
new challenges, mainly regarding the safety and authenticity of energy trade.
This study aimed to develop and build a secure, intelligent, and efficient
energy transaction system for the decentralized US energy market. This research
interlinks the technological prowess of blockchain and artificial intelligence
(AI) in a novel way to solve long-standing challenges in the distributed energy
market, specifically those of security, fraudulent behavior detection, and
market reliability. The dataset for this research is comprised of more than 1.2
million anonymized energy transaction records from a simulated peer-to-peer
(P2P) energy exchange network emulating real-life blockchain-based American
microgrids, including those tested by LO3 Energy and Grid+ Labs. Each record
contains detailed fields of transaction identifier, timestamp, energy volume
(kWh), transaction type (buy/sell), unit price, prosumer/consumer identifier
(hashed for privacy), smart meter readings, geolocation regions, and settlement
confirmation status. The dataset also includes system-calculated behavior
metrics of transaction rate, variability of energy production, and historical
pricing patterns. The system architecture proposed involves the integration of
two layers, namely a blockchain layer and artificial intelligence (AI) layer,
each playing a unique but complementary function in energy transaction securing
and market intelligence improvement. The machine learning models used in this
research were specifically chosen for their established high performance in
classification tasks, specifically in the identification of energy transaction
fraud in decentralized markets.

Abstract: Insurance fraud detection represents a pivotal advancement in modern
insurance service, providing intelligent and digitalized monitoring to enhance
management and prevent fraud. It is crucial for ensuring the security and
efficiency of insurance systems. Although AI and machine learning algorithms
have demonstrated strong performance in detecting fraudulent claims, the
absence of standardized defense mechanisms renders current systems vulnerable
to emerging adversarial threats. In this paper, we propose a GAN-based approach
to conduct adversarial attacks on fraud detection systems. Our results indicate
that an attacker, without knowledge of the training data or internal model
details, can generate fraudulent cases that are classified as legitimate with a
99\% attack success rate (ASR). By subtly modifying real insurance records and
claims, adversaries can significantly increase the fraud risk, potentially
bypassing compromised detection systems. These findings underscore the urgent
need to enhance the robustness of insurance fraud detection models against
adversarial manipulation, thereby ensuring the stability and reliability of
different insurance systems.

Motivation: 现有安全权重发布方案缺乏严格的安全基础，仅提供非正式的安全保证，需要形式化定义和评估。

Method: 引入具体的安全定义，并通过案例研究分析TaylorMLP的安全性。

Result: 发现TaylorMLP存在参数提取漏洞，未能实现其安全目标。

Conclusion: 呼吁在机器学习和安全领域的交叉研究中采用更严格的方法，为未来权重发布方案的设计和评估提供蓝图。

Abstract: Recent secure weight release schemes claim to enable open-source model
distribution while protecting model ownership and preventing misuse. However,
these approaches lack rigorous security foundations and provide only informal
security guarantees. Inspired by established works in cryptography, we
formalize the security of weight release schemes by introducing several
concrete security definitions. We then demonstrate our definition's utility
through a case study of TaylorMLP, a prominent secure weight release scheme.
Our analysis reveals vulnerabilities that allow parameter extraction thus
showing that TaylorMLP fails to achieve its informal security goals. We hope
this work will advocate for rigorous research at the intersection of machine
learning and security communities and provide a blueprint for how future weight
release schemes should be designed and evaluated.

Method: 在CICIDS2017数据集上对比了MLP、1D CNN、OCSVM和LOF四种模型，分别在已知攻击和未知攻击场景下的表现。

Result: 监督模型（MLP和CNN）在已知攻击上表现优异，但对未知攻击召回率低；无监督模型（LOF和OCSVM）在未知攻击上表现较好，其中OCSVM在精度和召回率上表现最均衡。

Conclusion: OCSVM在动态网络环境中表现出鲁棒性，为入侵检测系统的模型选择提供了实用建议。

Abstract: Identifying suitable machine learning paradigms for intrusion detection
remains critical for building effective and generalizable security solutions.
In this study, we present a controlled comparison of four representative models
- Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN),
One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) and Local Outlier Factor (LOF) - on
the CICIDS2017 dataset under two scenarios: detecting known attack types and
generalizing to previously unseen threats. Our results show that supervised MLP
and CNN achieve near-perfect accuracy on familiar attacks but suffer drastic
recall drops on novel attacks. Unsupervised LOF attains moderate overall
accuracy and high recall on unknown threats at the cost of elevated false
alarms, while boundary-based OCSVM balances precision and recall best,
demonstrating robust detection across both scenarios. These findings offer
practical guidance for selecting IDS models in dynamic network environments.

Result: 在两种数据集和八种流行LLM上验证了方法的可行性和优越性。

Conclusion: RCG方法能有效且隐蔽地防御PVA，提升隐私保护能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have made a profound impact
on our society and also raised new security concerns. Particularly, due to the
remarkable inference ability of LLMs, the privacy violation attack (PVA),
revealed by Staab et al., introduces serious personal privacy issues. Existing
defense methods mainly leverage LLMs to anonymize the input query, which
requires costly inference time and cannot gain satisfactory defense
performance. Moreover, directly rejecting the PVA query seems like an effective
defense method, while the defense method is exposed, promoting the evolution of
PVA. In this paper, we propose a novel defense paradigm based on
retrieval-confused generation (RCG) of LLMs, which can efficiently and covertly
defend the PVA. We first design a paraphrasing prompt to induce the LLM to
rewrite the "user comments" of the attack query to construct a disturbed
database. Then, we propose the most irrelevant retrieval strategy to retrieve
the desired user data from the disturbed database. Finally, the "data comments"
are replaced with the retrieved user data to form a defended query, leading to
responding to the adversary with some wrong personal attributes, i.e., the
attack fails. Extensive experiments are conducted on two datasets and eight
popular LLMs to comprehensively evaluate the feasibility and the superiority of
the proposed defense method.

Method: 提出RepuNet，通过模型相似性、参数变化、消息延迟和通信量等指标动态评估节点行为，并根据信誉分数调整节点在模型聚合中的影响力。

Result: 在MNIST和CIFAR-10数据集上测试，RepuNet的F1分数分别超过95%和约76%，显示出对恶意行为的有效检测和缓解能力。

Conclusion: RepuNet具有适应性、鲁棒性和实用性，为去中心化联邦学习环境中的威胁缓解提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) enables nodes to collaboratively train
models without a central server, introducing new vulnerabilities since each
node independently selects peers for model aggregation. Malicious nodes may
exploit this autonomy by sending corrupted models (model poisoning), delaying
model submissions (delay attack), or flooding the network with excessive
messages, negatively affecting system performance. Existing solutions often
depend on rigid configurations or additional infrastructures such as
blockchain, leading to computational overhead, scalability issues, or limited
adaptability. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes RepuNet, a
decentralized reputation system that categorizes threats in DFL and dynamically
evaluates node behavior using metrics like model similarity, parameter changes,
message latency, and communication volume. Nodes' influence in model
aggregation is adjusted based on their reputation scores. RepuNet was
integrated into the Nebula DFL platform and experimentally evaluated with MNIST
and CIFAR-10 datasets under non-IID distributions, using federations of up to
25 nodes in both fully connected and random topologies. Different attack
intensities, frequencies, and activation intervals were tested. Results
demonstrated that RepuNet effectively detects and mitigates malicious behavior,
achieving F1 scores above 95% for MNIST scenarios and approximately 76% for
CIFAR-10 cases. These outcomes highlight RepuNet's adaptability, robustness,
and practical potential for mitigating threats in decentralized federated
learning environments.

Conclusion: SV-LLM展示了通过多智能体协作和LLM技术革新硬件安全实践的潜力。

Abstract: Ensuring the security of complex system-on-chips (SoCs) designs is a critical
imperative, yet traditional verification techniques struggle to keep pace due
to significant challenges in automation, scalability, comprehensiveness, and
adaptability. The advent of large language models (LLMs), with their remarkable
capabilities in natural language understanding, code generation, and advanced
reasoning, presents a new paradigm for tackling these issues. Moving beyond
monolithic models, an agentic approach allows for the creation of multi-agent
systems where specialized LLMs collaborate to solve complex problems more
effectively. Recognizing this opportunity, we introduce SV-LLM, a novel
multi-agent assistant system designed to automate and enhance SoC security
verification. By integrating specialized agents for tasks like verification
question answering, security asset identification, threat modeling, test plan
and property generation, vulnerability detection, and simulation-based bug
validation, SV-LLM streamlines the workflow. To optimize their performance in
these diverse tasks, agents leverage different learning paradigms, such as
in-context learning, fine-tuning, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). The
system aims to reduce manual intervention, improve accuracy, and accelerate
security analysis, supporting proactive identification and mitigation of risks
early in the design cycle. We demonstrate its potential to transform hardware
security practices through illustrative case studies and experiments that
showcase its applicability and efficacy.

Result: 实验证明该方法能以最小交互有效规避检测，具有低计算成本和高部署性。

Conclusion: 该方法为网络流量中的对抗攻击研究提供了新思路，并为开发鲁棒防御奠定了基础。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks, wherein slight inputs are carefully crafted to mislead
intelligent models, have attracted increasing attention. However, a critical
gap persists between theoretical advancements and practical application,
particularly in structured data like network traffic, where interdependent
features complicate effective adversarial manipulations. Moreover, ambiguity in
current approaches restricts reproducibility and limits progress in this field.
Hence, existing defenses often fail to handle evolving adversarial attacks.
This paper proposes a novel approach for black-box adversarial attacks, that
addresses these limitations. Unlike prior work, which often assumes system
access or relies on repeated probing, our method strictly respect black-box
constraints, reducing interaction to avoid detection and better reflect
real-world scenarios. We present an adaptive feature selection strategy using
change-point detection and causality analysis to identify and target sensitive
features to perturbations. This lightweight design ensures low computational
cost and high deployability. Our comprehensive experiments show the attack's
effectiveness in evading detection with minimal interaction, enhancing its
adaptability and applicability in real-world scenarios. By advancing the
understanding of adversarial attacks in network traffic, this work lays a
foundation for developing robust defenses.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于时空点过程的概率模型，用于更全面地模拟阅读行为，包括注视点的位置、时间和持续时间，以及眼跳的动态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖于聚合的眼动追踪数据和强假设模型，忽略了阅读过程中的时空动态。本文旨在通过更通用的模型捕捉这些动态。

Method: 使用标记的时空点过程模型，眼跳采用Hawkes过程模拟，注视持续时间通过时间卷积的预测因子建模。

Result: Hawkes过程模型比基线更好地拟合人类眼跳行为，但上下文惊奇度对注视持续时间的预测准确性提升有限。

Conclusion: 惊奇度理论难以解释精细的眼动行为，表明需要更复杂的模型来捕捉阅读动态。

Abstract: Reading is a process that unfolds across space and time, alternating between
fixations where a reader focuses on a specific point in space, and saccades
where a reader rapidly shifts their focus to a new point. An ansatz of
psycholinguistics is that modeling a reader's fixations and saccades yields
insight into their online sentence processing. However, standard approaches to
such modeling rely on aggregated eye-tracking measurements and models that
impose strong assumptions, ignoring much of the spatio-temporal dynamics that
occur during reading. In this paper, we propose a more general probabilistic
model of reading behavior, based on a marked spatio-temporal point process,
that captures not only how long fixations last, but also where they land in
space and when they take place in time. The saccades are modeled using a Hawkes
process, which captures how each fixation excites the probability of a new
fixation occurring near it in time and space. The duration time of fixation
events is modeled as a function of fixation-specific predictors convolved
across time, thus capturing spillover effects. Empirically, our Hawkes process
model exhibits a better fit to human saccades than baselines. With respect to
fixation durations, we observe that incorporating contextual surprisal as a
predictor results in only a marginal improvement in the model's predictive
accuracy. This finding suggests that surprisal theory struggles to explain
fine-grained eye movements.

Result: MIRAGE成为目前最全面的视觉-语言模型基准之一，支持开放世界设置，要求模型推断潜在知识缺口并处理罕见实体。

Conclusion: MIRAGE为多模态模型在复杂、知识密集型领域的评估提供了高保真基准，推动了开放世界推理和交互能力的研究。

Abstract: We introduce MIRAGE, a new benchmark for multimodal expert-level reasoning
and decision-making in consultative interaction settings. Designed for the
agriculture domain, MIRAGE captures the full complexity of expert consultations
by combining natural user queries, expert-authored responses, and image-based
context, offering a high-fidelity benchmark for evaluating models on grounded
reasoning, clarification strategies, and long-form generation in a real-world,
knowledge-intensive domain. Grounded in over 35,000 real user-expert
interactions and curated through a carefully designed multi-step pipeline,
MIRAGE spans diverse crop health, pest diagnosis, and crop management
scenarios. The benchmark includes more than 7,000 unique biological entities,
covering plant species, pests, and diseases, making it one of the most
taxonomically diverse benchmarks available for vision-language models, grounded
in the real world. Unlike existing benchmarks that rely on well-specified user
inputs and closed-set taxonomies, MIRAGE features underspecified, context-rich
scenarios with open-world settings, requiring models to infer latent knowledge
gaps, handle rare entities, and either proactively guide the interaction or
respond. Project Page: https://mirage-benchmark.github.io

Conclusion: 机器学习会议应建立官方机制，支持研究自我修正，提升领域可信度。

Abstract: Science progresses by iteratively advancing and correcting humanity's
understanding of the world. In machine learning (ML) research, rapid
advancements have led to an explosion of publications, but have also led to
misleading, incorrect, flawed or perhaps even fraudulent studies being accepted
and sometimes highlighted at ML conferences due to the fallibility of peer
review. While such mistakes are understandable, ML conferences do not offer
robust processes to help the field systematically correct when such errors are
made.This position paper argues that ML conferences should establish a
dedicated "Refutations and Critiques" (R & C) Track. This R & C Track would
provide a high-profile, reputable platform to support vital research that
critically challenges prior research, thereby fostering a dynamic
self-correcting research ecosystem. We discuss key considerations including
track design, review principles, potential pitfalls, and provide an
illustrative example submission concerning a recent ICLR 2025 Oral. We conclude
that ML conferences should create official, reputable mechanisms to help ML
research self-correct.

Abstract: Recently, multi-objective optimization (MOO) has gained attention for its
broad applications in ML, operations research, and engineering. However, MOO
algorithm design remains in its infancy and many existing MOO methods suffer
from unsatisfactory convergence rate and sample complexity performance. To
address this challenge, in this paper, we propose an algorithm called STIMULUS(
stochastic path-integrated multi-gradient recursive e\ulstimator), a new and
robust approach for solving MOO problems. Different from the traditional
methods, STIMULUS introduces a simple yet powerful recursive framework for
updating stochastic gradient estimates to improve convergence performance with
low sample complexity. In addition, we introduce an enhanced version of
STIMULUS, termed STIMULUS-M, which incorporates a momentum term to further
expedite convergence. We establish $O(1/T)$ convergence rates of the proposed
methods for non-convex settings and $O (\exp{-\mu T})$ for strongly convex
settings, where $T$ is the total number of iteration rounds. Additionally, we
achieve the state-of-the-art $O \left(n+\sqrt{n}\epsilon^{-1}\right)$ sample
complexities for non-convex settings and $O\left(n+ \sqrt{n} \ln
({\mu/\epsilon})\right)$ for strongly convex settings, where $\epsilon>0$ is a
desired stationarity error. Moreover, to alleviate the periodic full gradient
evaluation requirement in STIMULUS and STIMULUS-M, we further propose enhanced
versions with adaptive batching called STIMULUS+/ STIMULUS-M+ and provide their
theoretical analysis.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出FlightKooba框架，结合HIPPO方法、Koopman理论和状态空间方程，显著提升飞行轨迹预测的效率和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Koopman理论的飞行轨迹预测模型效率低、可解释性差、计算量大，需改进。

Method: FlightKooba直接基于数据构建Koopman算子，减少可训练参数，降低训练时间和内存消耗。

Result: 实验显示FlightKooba在时间和内存消耗上优于现有方法，参数减少10倍，内存降低50%以上。

Conclusion: FlightKooba为Koopman算子的快速计算提供了新方法，为时间序列预测与控制结合开辟了新途径。

Abstract: The Koopman theory is a powerful and effective modeling tool for converting
nonlinear systems into linear representations, and flight trajectory prediction
(FTP) is a complex nonlinear system. However, current models applying the
Koopman theory to FTP tasks are not very effective, model interpretability is
indeed an issue, and the Koopman operators are computationally intensive,
resulting in long training times. To address this issue, this paper proposes a
new modeling and control framework based on the HIPPO method, the Koopman
theory, and state space equations from cybernetics: FlightKooba. Inspired by
the idea of structural state space equations, FlightKooba directly constructs
the Koopman operators from data. This makes the framework highly interpretable
and significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters in the module,
thereby greatly reducing training time. Experiments have demonstrated the
superiority of the FlightKooba modeling method in terms of time and memory
consumption (training time comparable to the Mamba module without using
CUDA-level acceleration; memory reduced by more than 50% on most datasets, with
a tenfold reduction in the number of parameters), essentially completing the
FTP task. It provides a new method for the fast computation of the Koopman
operators, opening up new possibilities for the combination of time series
forecasting and control.

*Ziru Zhang,Jiadong Yu,Danny H. K. Tsang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合自适应关键帧提取和因果感知强化学习的智能框架，以最大化多用户VR交互中的QoE。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视了带宽、CPU频率和用户感知之间的因果关系，限制了QoE的提升。

Method: 结合Weber-Fechner定律制定QoE指标，采用MIP任务优化资源分配，并提出了PS-CDDPG算法。

Result: 实验表明，该框架显著降低了交互延迟，提升了QoE，并保持了公平性。

Conclusion: 该框架在多用户VR交互中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: The optimization of quality of experience (QoE) in multi-user virtual reality
(VR) interactions demands a delicate balance between ultra-low latency,
high-fidelity motion synchronization, and equitable resource allocation. While
adaptive keyframe extraction mitigates transmission overhead, existing
approaches often overlook the causal relationships among allocated bandwidth,
CPU frequency, and user perception, limiting QoE gains. This paper proposes an
intelligent framework to maximize QoE by integrating adaptive keyframe
extraction with causal-aware reinforcement learning (RL). First, a novel QoE
metric is formulated using the Weber-Fechner Law, combining perceptual
sensitivity, attention-driven priorities, and motion reconstruction accuracy.
The QoE optimization problem is then modeled as a mixed integer programming
(MIP) task, jointly optimizing keyframe ratios, bandwidth, and computational
resources under horizon-fairness constraints. We propose Partial State Causal
Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (PS-CDDPG), which integrates the Deep
Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) method with causal influence detection. By
leveraging causal information regarding how QoE is influenced and determined by
various actions, we explore actions guided by weights calculated from causal
inference (CI), which in turn improves training efficiency. Experiments
conducted with the CMU Motion Capture Database demonstrate that our framework
significantly reduces interactive latency, enhances QoE, and maintains
fairness, achieving superior performance compared to benchmark methods.

Motivation: 满足隐私法规（如GDPR）要求，解决现有方法在遗忘速度与预测精度之间的权衡问题。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证了方法的有效性，实现了毫秒级响应、完全遗忘目标类，且对保留数据精度损失极小。

Conclusion: 该框架为MLaaS场景提供了高效、实用的实时机器遗忘解决方案。

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to selectively remove class-specific knowledge from
pretrained neural networks to satisfy privacy regulations such as the GDPR.
Existing methods typically face a trade-off between unlearning speed and
preservation of predictive accuracy, often incurring either high computational
overhead or significant performance degradation on retained classes. In this
paper, we propose a novel class-aware soft pruning framework leveraging
orthogonal convolutional kernel regularization to achieve rapid and precise
forgetting with millisecond-level response times. By enforcing orthogonality
constraints during training, our method decorrelates convolutional filters and
disentangles feature representations, while efficiently identifying
class-specific channels through activation difference analysis. Extensive
evaluations across multiple architectures and datasets demonstrate stable
pruning with near-instant execution, complete forgetting of targeted classes,
and minimal accuracy loss on retained data. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
and TinyImageNet confirm that our approach substantially reduces membership
inference attack risks and accelerates unlearning by orders of magnitude
compared to state-of-the-art baselines. This framework provides an efficient,
practical solution for real-time machine unlearning in Machine Learning as a
Service (MLaaS) scenarios.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DeKA-g的知识对齐算法，通过蒸馏技术优化生成语义通信（GSC）系统，提升边缘生成内容与云端生成内容的一致性，并适应多样化的无线信道条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI生成内容（AIGC）的激增，从云端向边缘和移动用户传输内容导致网络流量剧增。生成语义通信（GSC）通过传输高度压缩的信息（如提示文本和潜在表示）提供解决方案，但知识对齐问题仍具挑战性。

Method: DeKA-g通过蒸馏云端生成AI（GAI）的知识为低秩矩阵，供边缘使用，并适应不同无线信道条件。包含两种新方法：元词辅助知识蒸馏（MAKD）和可变速率分组SNR适应（VGSA）。

Result: 实验表明，DeKA-g将边缘生成图像与云端生成图像的对齐度提升44%，压缩率适应效率提高116%，低信噪比条件下性能提升28%。

Conclusion: DeKA-g有效解决了GSC系统中的知识对齐问题，显著提升了生成内容的一致性和传输效率。

Abstract: Due to the surging amount of AI-generated content (AIGC), its provisioning to
edges and mobile users from the cloud incurs substantial traffic on networks.
Generative semantic communication (GSC) offers a promising solution by
transmitting highly compact information, i.e., prompt text and latent
representations, instead of high-dimensional AIGC data. However, GSC relies on
the alignment between the knowledge in the cloud generative AI (GAI) and that
possessed by the edges and users, and between the knowledge for wireless
transmission and that of actual channels, which remains challenging. In this
paper, we propose DeKA-g, a distillation-enabled knowledge alignment algorithm
for GSC systems. The core idea is to distill the generation knowledge from the
cloud-GAI into low-rank matrices, which can be incorporated by the edge and
used to adapt the transmission knowledge to diverse wireless channel
conditions. DeKA-g comprises two novel methods: metaword-aided knowledge
distillation (MAKD) and variable-rate grouped SNR adaptation (VGSA). For MAKD,
an optimized metaword is employed to enhance the efficiency of knowledge
distillation, while VGSA enables efficient adaptation to diverse compression
rates and SNR ranges. From simulation results, DeKA-g improves the alignment
between the edge-generated images and the cloud-generated ones by 44%.
Moreover, it adapts to compression rates with 116% higher efficiency than the
baseline and enhances the performance in low-SNR conditions by 28%.

Motivation: 电力市场复杂且依赖性强，传统计量经济学方法（白盒模型）不如DNN强大，但缺乏可解释性。本文旨在结合DNN的预测能力和XAI的解释性，以揭示价格动态的驱动因素。

Method: 应用DNN预测价格，使用SHAP和Gradient等XAI方法，结合热图（显著性图）分析五个电力市场中各特征的行为和贡献。提出SSHAP值和SSHAP线的新概念。

Result: 通过XAI方法成功识别了影响电力市场价格的关键因素，并提出了新的可视化工具（SSHAP值和SSHAP线）来增强高维表格模型的可解释性。

Conclusion: 结合DNN和XAI方法不仅能提高预测准确性，还能增强对电力市场运作机制的理解，为市场参与者提供更透明的决策支持。

Abstract: Electricity markets are highly complex, involving lots of interactions and
complex dependencies that make it hard to understand the inner workings of the
market and what is driving prices. Econometric methods have been developed for
this, white-box models, however, they are not as powerful as deep neural
network models (DNN). In this paper, we use a DNN to forecast the price and
then use XAI methods to understand the factors driving the price dynamics in
the market. The objective is to increase our understanding of how different
electricity markets work. To do that, we apply explainable methods such as SHAP
and Gradient, combined with visual techniques like heatmaps (saliency maps) to
analyse the behaviour and contributions of various features across five
electricity markets. We introduce the novel concepts of SSHAP values and SSHAP
lines to enhance the complex representation of high-dimensional tabular models.

<details>

Motivation: 神经网络在高风险领域（如医疗诊断或自动驾驶）中的错误决策可能导致严重后果，因此需要有效的不确定性测量方法。

Method: 基于每层中与查询具有相似激活向量的训练案例，提出两个新指标：决策变化和层不确定性。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和MNIST数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于基于softmax的置信度估计。

Conclusion: 新框架和指标能有效提升不确定性估计，尤其在复杂分类任务中。

Abstract: Neural Networks have high accuracy in solving problems where it is difficult
to detect patterns or create a logical model. However, these algorithms
sometimes return wrong solutions, which become problematic in high-risk domains
like medical diagnosis or autonomous driving. One strategy to detect and
mitigate these errors is the measurement of the uncertainty over neural network
decisions. In this paper, we present a novel post-hoc framework for measuring
the uncertainty of a decision based on retrieved training cases that have a
similar activation vector to the query for each layer. Based on these retrieved
cases, we propose two new metrics: Decision Change and Layer Uncertainty, which
capture changes in nearest-neighbor class distributions across layers. We
evaluated our approach in a classification model for two datasets: CIFAR-10 and
MNIST. The results show that these metrics enhance uncertainty estimation,
especially in challenging classification tasks, outperforming softmax-based
confidence.

TL;DR: 论文研究了机器学习模型记忆训练数据的现象，提出仅依赖自影响（self-influence）会低估记忆化风险，需考虑完整影响分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨记忆化现象及其隐私和泛化问题，揭示自影响不足以全面评估记忆化风险。

Method: 通过计算训练样本间的完整影响分布，分析其特性，并在小语言模型和图像分类任务中验证。

Result: 发现自影响严重低估风险，近重复样本的存在显著降低自影响但仍可被提取。

Conclusion: 记忆化是训练数据间复杂相互作用的结果，完整影响分布比自影响更能准确捕捉其本质。

Abstract: Machine learning models are known to memorize samples from their training
data, raising concerns around privacy and generalization. Counterfactual
self-influence is a popular metric to study memorization, quantifying how the
model's prediction for a sample changes depending on the sample's inclusion in
the training dataset. However, recent work has shown memorization to be
affected by factors beyond self-influence, with other training samples, in
particular (near-)duplicates, having a large impact. We here study memorization
treating counterfactual influence as a distributional quantity, taking into
account how all training samples influence how a sample is memorized. For a
small language model, we compute the full influence distribution of training
samples on each other and analyze its properties. We find that solely looking
at self-influence can severely underestimate tangible risks associated with
memorization: the presence of (near-)duplicates seriously reduces
self-influence, while we find these samples to be (near-)extractable. We
observe similar patterns for image classification, where simply looking at the
influence distributions reveals the presence of near-duplicates in CIFAR-10.
Our findings highlight that memorization stems from complex interactions across
training data and is better captured by the full influence distribution than by
self-influence alone.

Motivation: 探索离策略强化学习在大型语言模型对齐中的应用，解决其性能不足的问题。

Method: 分析一种简单的离策略REINFORCE算法，其中优势定义为A=r-V，并通过理论证明和实验验证其有效性。

Result: 当基线V低于预期奖励时，算法具有策略改进保证；离策略更新更依赖正奖励信号。

Conclusion: 离策略强化学习在语言模型对齐中具有潜力，但需更关注正奖励信号以优化性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is increasingly used to align large language
models (LLMs). Off-policy methods offer greater implementation simplicity and
data efficiency than on-policy techniques, but often result in suboptimal
performance. In this work, we study the intermediate range of algorithms
between off-policy RL and supervised fine-tuning by analyzing a simple
off-policy REINFORCE algorithm, where the advantage is defined as $A=r-V$, with
$r$ a reward and $V$ some tunable baseline. Intuitively, lowering $V$
emphasizes high-reward samples, while raising it penalizes low-reward ones more
heavily. We first provide a theoretical analysis of this off-policy REINFORCE
algorithm, showing that when the baseline $V$ lower-bounds the expected reward,
the algorithm enjoys a policy improvement guarantee. Our analysis reveals that
while on-policy updates can safely leverage both positive and negative signals,
off-policy updates benefit from focusing more on positive rewards than on
negative ones. We validate our findings experimentally in a controlled
stochastic bandit setting and through fine-tuning state-of-the-art LLMs on
reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: PLoP（Precise LoRA Placement）是一种轻量级方法，通过理论分析自动确定LoRA适配器的最佳放置位置，显著优于或至少与常用策略相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LoRA适配器放置策略缺乏一致性，且未系统研究最佳放置位置，因此提出PLoP以优化性能。

Method: 通过直观理论分析，自动识别预训练模型和微调任务中LoRA适配器的最佳模块类型。

Result: PLoP在监督微调和强化学习任务中表现优于或与常用策略相当。

Conclusion: PLoP为LoRA适配器放置提供了一种高效且自动化的解决方案。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a widely used finetuning method for large
models. Its small memory footprint allows practitioners to adapt large models
to specific tasks at a fraction of the cost of full finetuning. Different
modifications have been proposed to enhance its efficiency by, for example,
setting the learning rate, the rank, and the initialization. Another
improvement axis is adapter placement strategy: when using LoRA, practitioners
usually pick module types to adapt with LoRA, such as Query and Key modules.
Few works have studied the problem of adapter placement, with nonconclusive
results: original LoRA paper suggested placing adapters in attention modules,
while other works suggested placing them in the MLP modules. Through an
intuitive theoretical analysis, we introduce PLoP (Precise LoRA Placement), a
lightweight method that allows automatic identification of module types where
LoRA adapters should be placed, given a pretrained model and a finetuning task.
We demonstrate that PLoP consistently outperforms, and in the worst case
competes, with commonly used placement strategies through comprehensive
experiments on supervised finetuning and reinforcement learning for reasoning.

Motivation: 复杂数据集的快速增长需要既能有效分组数据又能提供人类可理解洞察的工具。

Conclusion: HERCULES在提升聚类结果的可解释性和实用性方面具有潜力。

Abstract: The explosive growth of complex datasets across various modalities
necessitates advanced analytical tools that not only group data effectively but
also provide human-understandable insights into the discovered structures. We
introduce HERCULES (Hierarchical Embedding-based Recursive Clustering Using
LLMs for Efficient Summarization), a novel algorithm and Python package
designed for hierarchical k-means clustering of diverse data types, including
text, images, and numeric data (processed one modality per run). HERCULES
constructs a cluster hierarchy by recursively applying k-means clustering,
starting from individual data points at level 0. A key innovation is its deep
integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate semantically rich
titles and descriptions for clusters at each level of the hierarchy,
significantly enhancing interpretability. The algorithm supports two main
representation modes: `direct' mode, which clusters based on original data
embeddings or scaled numeric features, and `description' mode, which clusters
based on embeddings derived from LLM-generated summaries. Users can provide a
`topic\_seed' to guide LLM-generated summaries towards specific themes. An
interactive visualization tool facilitates thorough analysis and understanding
of the clustering results. We demonstrate HERCULES's capabilities and discuss
its potential for extracting meaningful, hierarchical knowledge from complex
datasets.

Motivation: 解决深度强化学习在未见环境中泛化能力不足的问题，改进现有UED方法的遗憾近似方式。

Method: 引入过渡预测误差作为遗憾近似的新项，并提出共同学习性度量任务间影响，结合二者形成TRACED方法。

Result: TRACED在多个基准测试中提升零样本泛化能力，且环境交互需求减少至基线方法的50%。

Conclusion: 通过精细的遗憾近似和任务关系建模，TRACED为UED提供了样本高效的课程设计方法。

Abstract: Generalizing deep reinforcement learning agents to unseen environments
remains a significant challenge. One promising solution is Unsupervised
Environment Design (UED), a co-evolutionary framework in which a teacher
adaptively generates tasks with high learning potential, while a student learns
a robust policy from this evolving curriculum. Existing UED methods typically
measure learning potential via regret, the gap between optimal and current
performance, approximated solely by value-function loss. Building on these
approaches, we introduce the transition prediction error as an additional term
in our regret approximation. To capture how training on one task affects
performance on others, we further propose a lightweight metric called
co-learnability. By combining these two measures, we present Transition-aware
Regret Approximation with Co-learnability for Environment Design (TRACED).
Empirical evaluations show that TRACED yields curricula that improve zero-shot
generalization across multiple benchmarks while requiring up to 2x fewer
environment interactions than strong baselines. Ablation studies confirm that
the transition prediction error drives rapid complexity ramp-up and that
co-learnability delivers additional gains when paired with the transition
prediction error. These results demonstrate how refined regret approximation
and explicit modeling of task relationships can be leveraged for
sample-efficient curriculum design in UED.

Conclusion: 该方法通过自适应的微调机制，有效解决了传统量子联邦学习的局限性，适用于复杂应用场景。

Abstract: Client heterogeneity poses significant challenges to the performance of
Quantum Federated Learning (QFL). To overcome these limitations, we propose a
new approach leveraging deep unfolding, which enables clients to autonomously
optimize hyperparameters, such as learning rates and regularization factors,
based on their specific training behavior. This dynamic adaptation mitigates
overfitting and ensures robust optimization in highly heterogeneous
environments where standard aggregation methods often fail. Our framework
achieves approximately 90% accuracy, significantly outperforming traditional
methods, which typically yield around 55% accuracy, as demonstrated through
real-time training on IBM quantum hardware and Qiskit Aer simulators. By
developing self adaptive fine tuning, the proposed method proves particularly
effective in critical applications such as gene expression analysis and cancer
detection, enhancing diagnostic precision and predictive modeling within
quantum systems. Our results are attributed to convergence-aware, learnable
optimization steps intrinsic to the deep unfolded framework, which maintains
the generalization. Hence, this study addresses the core limitations of
conventional QFL, streamlining its applicability to any complex challenges such
as healthcare and genomic research.

TL;DR: 研究比较了自回归（AR）和掩码扩散模型（MDM）在解码器框架下的表现，发现MDM作为任意顺序AR（AO-AR）在生成速度和困惑度上有优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 比较AR和MDM时，架构差异（解码器vs编码器）导致不公平对比，需在相同架构下评估核心范式差异。

Method: 在解码器框架下评估MDM（AO-AR），比较其与标准AR的性能，并研究架构（解码器vs编码器）对MDM的影响。

Result: 解码器MDM在生成速度上显著提升（25倍），困惑度与标准AR相当，而编码器MDM建模更简单。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了范式与架构的独立影响，为未来模型设计提供了指导。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) predominantly use autoregressive (AR)
approaches, but masked diffusion models (MDMs) are emerging as viable
alternatives. A key challenge in comparing AR and MDM paradigms is their
typical architectural difference: AR models are often decoder-only, while MDMs
have largely been encoder-only. This practice of changing both the modeling
paradigm and architecture simultaneously makes direct comparisons unfair, as
it's hard to distinguish whether observed differences stem from the paradigm
itself or the architectural shift. This research evaluates MDMs within a
decoder-only framework to: (1) equitably compare MDM (as Any-Order AR, or
AO-AR) and standard AR paradigms. Our investigation suggests that the standard
AO-AR objective, which averages over all token permutations, may benefit from
refinement, as many permutations appear less informative compared to the
language's inherent left-to-right structure. (2) Investigate architectural
influences (decoder-only vs. encoder-only) within MDMs. We demonstrate that
while encoder-only MDMs model a simpler conditional probability space,
decoder-only MDMs can achieve dramatic generation speedups ($\sim25\times$) and
comparable perplexity with temperature annealing despite modeling a vastly
larger space, highlighting key trade-offs. This work thus decouples core
paradigm differences from architectural influences, offering insights for
future model design. Code is available at https://github.com/scxue/AO-GPT-MDM.

TL;DR: ERDM框架将滚动预测结构与高性能扩散模型结合，通过改进噪声调度、网络预处理和采样器，显著提升了高维混沌系统中的概率预测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在高维混沌系统中难以建模复杂时间依赖性和逐步增长的预测不确定性，需要一种更有效的框架来解决这一问题。

Method: ERDM通过改进噪声调度、网络预处理和Heun采样器，结合新的损失加权方案、预训练初始化策略和混合序列架构，实现了滚动预测与高性能扩散模型的统一。

Conclusion: ERDM为处理扩散模型序列生成问题提供了一个灵活且强大的框架，特别适用于不确定性逐步增加的任务。

Abstract: Diffusion models are a powerful tool for probabilistic forecasting, yet most
applications in high-dimensional chaotic systems predict future snapshots
one-by-one. This common approach struggles to model complex temporal
dependencies and fails to explicitly account for the progressive growth of
uncertainty inherent to such systems. While rolling diffusion frameworks, which
apply increasing noise to forecasts at longer lead times, have been proposed to
address this, their integration with state-of-the-art, high-fidelity diffusion
techniques remains a significant challenge. We tackle this problem by
introducing Elucidated Rolling Diffusion Models (ERDM), the first framework to
successfully unify a rolling forecast structure with the principled, performant
design of Elucidated Diffusion Models (EDM). To do this, we adapt the core EDM
components-its noise schedule, network preconditioning, and Heun sampler-to the
rolling forecast setting. The success of this integration is driven by three
key contributions: (i) a novel loss weighting scheme that focuses model
capacity on the mid-range forecast horizons where determinism gives way to
stochasticity; (ii) an efficient initialization strategy using a pre-trained
EDM for the initial window; and (iii) a bespoke hybrid sequence architecture
for robust spatiotemporal feature extraction under progressive denoising. On 2D
Navier-Stokes simulations and ERA5 global weather forecasting at 1.5^\circ
resolution, ERDM consistently outperforms key diffusion-based baselines,
including conditional autoregressive EDM. ERDM offers a flexible and powerful
general framework for tackling diffusion-based sequence generation problems
where modeling escalating uncertainty is paramount. Code is available at:

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的理论框架和计算方法，用于生成多样化的行动方案（COA）池，适用于多智能体任务分配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在灾害响应、搜救和军事任务中，多智能体操作需要自动化支持以规划行动方案，同时环境变化和智能体能力差异带来了挑战和机遇。

Method: 采用图抽象表示任务空间和COA池，使用遗传算法最大化COA池的多样性和任务分配兼容性，并通过图神经网络进行单智能体任务排序。

Result: 模拟测试显示，该方法在性能上显著优于随机基线，任务排序的最优性差距小，且能在50分钟内为5智能体/100任务操作规划20个COA。

Conclusion: 该框架能有效生成多样化的COA池，适应任务特征变化，提高任务完成率。

Abstract: Operations in disaster response, search \& rescue, and military missions that
involve multiple agents demand automated processes to support the planning of
the courses of action (COA). Moreover, traverse-affecting changes in the
environment (rain, snow, blockades, etc.) may impact the expected performance
of a COA, making it desirable to have a pool of COAs that are diverse in task
distributions across agents. Further, variations in agent capabilities, which
could be human crews and/or autonomous systems, present practical opportunities
and computational challenges to the planning process. This paper presents a new
theoretical formulation and computational framework to generate such diverse
pools of COAs for operations with soft variations in agent-task compatibility.
Key to the problem formulation is a graph abstraction of the task space and the
pool of COAs itself to quantify its diversity. Formulating the COAs as a
centralized multi-robot task allocation problem, a genetic algorithm is used
for (order-ignoring) allocations of tasks to each agent that jointly maximize
diversity within the COA pool and overall compatibility of the agent-task
mappings. A graph neural network is trained using a policy gradient approach to
then perform single agent task sequencing in each COA, which maximizes
completion rates adaptive to task features. Our tests of the COA generation
process in a simulated environment demonstrate significant performance gain
over a random walk baseline, small optimality gap in task sequencing, and
execution time of about 50 minutes to plan up to 20 COAs for 5 agent/100 task
operations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CLVQVAE的框架，通过向量量化技术跨层映射表示，将重复的残差流特征压缩为紧凑、可解释的概念向量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究通常只关注单层神经表示，忽略了跨层叠加和冗余问题，导致特征演化难以理解。

Method: 结合了top-k温度采样和EMA码本更新的向量量化方法，并采用缩放球形k-means++进行码本初始化。

Result: 能够更有效地捕捉跨层语义结构，生成紧凑且可解释的概念向量。

Conclusion: CLVQVAE框架为解决跨层特征演化问题提供了新思路，具有潜在的应用价值。

Abstract: Uncovering emergent concepts across transformer layers remains a significant
challenge because the residual stream linearly mixes and duplicates
information, obscuring how features evolve within large language models.
Current research efforts primarily inspect neural representations at single
layers, thereby overlooking this cross-layer superposition and the redundancy
it introduces. These representations are typically either analyzed directly for
activation patterns or passed to probing classifiers that map them to a limited
set of predefined concepts. To address these limitations, we propose
\gls{clvqvae}, a framework that uses vector quantization to map representations
across layers and in the process collapse duplicated residual-stream features
into compact, interpretable concept vectors. Our approach uniquely combines
top-$k$ temperature-based sampling during quantization with EMA codebook
updates, providing controlled exploration of the discrete latent space while
maintaining code-book diversity. We further enhance the framework with
scaled-spherical k-means++ for codebook initialization, which clusters by
directional similarity rather than magnitude, better aligning with semantic
structure in word embedding space.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为FedBKD的无数据蒸馏框架，通过生成对抗网络（GAN）合成数据，实现全局与局部模型的双向知识蒸馏，解决了联邦学习中非独立同分布（non-IID）数据的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习（FL）面临非独立同分布数据处理的挑战，现有方法难以同时优化全局和局部模型，且引入公共数据集可能增加数据泄露风险。

Method: 使用GAN生成合成数据，局部模型作为判别器并冻结参数，通过合成数据实现全局与局部模型的双向知识蒸馏。

Result: 在4个基准测试中，FedBKD在不同非IID设置下均达到最优性能。

Conclusion: FedBKD有效解决了非IID数据问题，同时提升了全局和局部模型的性能，且避免了数据泄露风险。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a decentralized collaborative machine learning
(ML) technique. It provides a solution to the issues of isolated data islands
and data privacy leakage in industrial ML practices. One major challenge in FL
is handling the non-identical and independent distributed (non-IID) data.
Current solutions either focus on constructing an all-powerful global model, or
customizing personalized local models. Few of them can provide both a
well-generalized global model and well-performed local models at the same time.
Additionally, many FL solutions to the non-IID problem are benefited from
introducing public datasets. However, this will also increase the risk of data
leakage. To tackle the problems, we propose a novel data-free distillation
framework, Federated Bidirectional Knowledge Distillation (FedBKD).
Specifically, we train Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) for synthetic
data. During the GAN training, local models serve as discriminators and their
parameters are frozen. The synthetic data is then used for bidirectional
distillation between global and local models to achieve knowledge interactions
so that performances for both sides are improved. We conduct extensive
experiments on 4 benchmarks under different non-IID settings. The results show
that FedBKD achieves SOTA performances in every case.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多类不平衡数据流的分类问题研究较少，动态不平衡比的管理是关键挑战。

Method: 结合LSH-RHP和DynED框架，通过LSH-RHP对多数类进行欠采样，提供平衡训练集。

Result: 在23个真实和10个半合成数据集上，LSH-DynED在Kappa和mG-Mean指标上优于15种现有方法。

Conclusion: LSH-DynED在大规模、高维数据集中表现优异，具有适应性和鲁棒性，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: The classification of imbalanced data streams, which have unequal class
distributions, is a key difficulty in machine learning, especially when dealing
with multiple classes. While binary imbalanced data stream classification tasks
have received considerable attention, only a few studies have focused on
multi-class imbalanced data streams. Effectively managing the dynamic imbalance
ratio is a key challenge in this domain. This study introduces a novel, robust,
and resilient approach to address these challenges by integrating Locality
Sensitive Hashing with Random Hyperplane Projections (LSH-RHP) into the Dynamic
Ensemble Diversification (DynED) framework. To the best of our knowledge, we
present the first application of LSH-RHP for undersampling in the context of
imbalanced non-stationary data streams. The proposed method undersamples the
majority classes by utilizing LSH-RHP, provides a balanced training set, and
improves the ensemble's prediction performance. We conduct comprehensive
experiments on 23 real-world and ten semi-synthetic datasets and compare
LSH-DynED with 15 state-of-the-art methods. The results reveal that LSH-DynED
outperforms other approaches in terms of both Kappa and mG-Mean effectiveness
measures, demonstrating its capability in dealing with multi-class imbalanced
non-stationary data streams. Notably, LSH-DynED performs well in large-scale,
high-dimensional datasets with considerable class imbalances and demonstrates
adaptation and robustness in real-world circumstances. To motivate our design,
we review existing methods for imbalanced data streams, outline key challenges,
and offer guidance for future work. For the reproducibility of our results, we
have made our implementation available on GitHub.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在临床环境中，量化图神经网络（GNNs）的预测不确定性对可信度至关重要，但现有方法（如贝叶斯和集成方法）计算成本高且无法充分捕捉模型多样性。

Method: 采用自蒸馏技术，同一网络同时作为教师和学生模型，避免独立训练多个网络，并开发了一种不确定性度量方法，为每个GNN分类器分配不同权重。

Result: 在MIMIC-IV和Enzymes数据集上的实验表明，该方法能有效捕捉模型预测不确定性，性能与MC Dropout和集成方法相当。

Conclusion: 所提方法在计算效率和精度上优于传统不确定性量化方法，适用于临床环境。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable performance in the
healthcare domain. However, what remained challenging is quantifying the
predictive uncertainty of GNNs, which is an important aspect of trustworthiness
in clinical settings. While Bayesian and ensemble methods can be used to
quantify uncertainty, they are computationally expensive. Additionally, the
disagreement metric used by ensemble methods to compute uncertainty cannot
capture the diversity of models in an ensemble network. In this paper, we
propose a novel method, based on knowledge distillation, to quantify GNNs'
uncertainty more efficiently and with higher precision. We apply
self-distillation, where the same network serves as both the teacher and
student models, thereby avoiding the need to train several networks
independently. To ensure the impact of self-distillation, we develop an
uncertainty metric that captures the diverse nature of the network by assigning
different weights to each GNN classifier. We experimentally evaluate the
precision, performance, and ability of our approach in distinguishing
out-of-distribution data on two graph datasets: MIMIC-IV and Enzymes. The
evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively capture
the predictive uncertainty of the model while having performance similar to
that of the MC Dropout and ensemble methods. The code is publicly available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索中等输入敏感性的学习函数，尤其是QR码解码任务，以填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 使用Transformer模型进行QR码解码实验，分析其对数据位和纠错位的关注差异。

Result: Transformer模型成功解码QR码，甚至超越理论纠错限制，并能泛化到其他语言和随机字符串。

Conclusion: Transformer模型的解码机制与标准QR码阅读器不同，更关注数据位而非纠错位。

Abstract: The hardness of learning a function that attains a target task relates to its
input-sensitivity. For example, image classification tasks are
input-insensitive as minor corruptions should not affect the classification
results, whereas arithmetic and symbolic computation, which have been recently
attracting interest, are highly input-sensitive as each input variable connects
to the computation results. This study presents the first learning-based Quick
Response (QR) code decoding and investigates learning functions of medium
sensitivity. Our experiments reveal that Transformers can successfully decode
QR codes, even beyond the theoretical error-correction limit, by learning the
structure of embedded texts. They generalize from English-rich training data to
other languages and even random strings. Moreover, we observe that the
Transformer-based QR decoder focuses on data bits while ignoring
error-correction bits, suggesting a decoding mechanism distinct from standard
QR code readers.

Result: 在区分DeepSeek-Coder、CodeGemma和Stable-Code等LLM时，Anubis仅需约2000个样本即可达到高AUROC分数（≥0.9）。

Conclusion: Anubis是一种有效的零样本归因工具，适用于代码来源的准确识别。

Abstract: A growing fraction of all code is sampled from Large Language Models (LLMs).
We investigate the problem of attributing code generated by language models
using hypothesis testing to leverage established techniques and guarantees.
Given a set of samples $S$ and a suspect model $\mathcal{L}^*$, our goal is to
assess the likelihood of $S$ originating from $\mathcal{L}^*$. Due to the curse
of dimensionality, this is intractable when only samples from the LLM are
given: to circumvent this, we use both samples and density estimates from the
LLM, a form of access commonly available.
  We introduce $\mathsf{Anubis}$, a zero-shot attribution tool that frames
attribution as a distribution testing problem. Our experiments on a benchmark
of code samples show that $\mathsf{Anubis}$ achieves high AUROC scores (
$\ge0.9$) when distinguishing between LLMs like DeepSeek-Coder, CodeGemma, and
Stable-Code using only $\approx 2000$ samples.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 情感计算中情感启动效应的模糊性是一个重要挑战，当前研究主要基于标签视角，而数据本身（尤其是生理信号）受启动效应的影响尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出APS方法，为每个数据点分配分数以量化其受启动效应影响的程度，并在SEED和SEED-VII数据集上验证其效果。

Result: 使用去启动效应序列训练的模型，其误分类率显著低于使用原始数据的模型。

Conclusion: APS方法通过数据层面识别和缓解启动效应，提升了模型鲁棒性，并为情感计算数据集的设计和收集提供了新思路。

Abstract: Affective priming exemplifies the challenge of ambiguity in affective
computing. While the community has largely addressed this issue from a
label-based perspective, identifying data points in the sequence affected by
the priming effect, the impact of priming on data itself, particularly in
physiological signals, remains underexplored. Data affected by priming can lead
to misclassifications when used in learning models. This study proposes the
Affective Priming Score (APS), a data-driven method to detect data points
influenced by the priming effect. The APS assigns a score to each data point,
quantifying the extent to which it is affected by priming. To validate this
method, we apply it to the SEED and SEED-VII datasets, which contain sufficient
transitions between emotional events to exhibit priming effects. We train
models with the same configuration using both the original data and
priming-free sequences. The misclassification rate is significantly reduced
when using priming-free sequences compared to the original data. This work
contributes to the broader challenge of ambiguity by identifying and mitigating
priming effects at the data level, enhancing model robustness, and offering
valuable insights for the design and collection of affective computing
datasets.

Conclusion: 融合社区信息的GNN框架能显著提升有向图链接预测性能，且通过线图转换进一步优化了信息聚合。

Abstract: Link prediction is a classical problem in graph analysis with many practical
applications. For directed graphs, recently developed deep learning approaches
typically analyze node similarities through contrastive learning and aggregate
neighborhood information through graph convolutions. In this work, we propose a
novel graph neural network (GNN) framework to fuse feature embedding with
community information. We theoretically demonstrate that such hybrid features
can improve the performance of directed link prediction. To utilize such
features efficiently, we also propose an approach to transform input graphs
into directed line graphs so that nodes in the transformed graph can aggregate
more information during graph convolutions. Experiments on benchmark datasets
show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art in most cases when 30%,
40%, 50%, and 60% of the connected links are used as training data,
respectively.

Abstract: Quantized large language models (LLMs) have gained increasing attention and
significance for enabling deployment in resource-constrained environments.
However, emerging studies on a few calibration dataset-free quantization
methods suggest that quantization may compromise the safety capabilities of
LLMs, underscoring the urgent need for systematic safety evaluations and
effective mitigation strategies. In this paper, we present comprehensive safety
evaluations across various mainstream quantization techniques and diverse
calibration datasets, utilizing widely accepted safety benchmarks. To address
the identified safety vulnerabilities, we propose a quantization-aware safety
patching framework, Q-resafe, to efficiently restore the safety capabilities of
quantized LLMs while minimizing any adverse impact on utility. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that Q-resafe successfully re-aligns the
safety of quantized LLMs with their pre-quantization counterparts, even under
challenging evaluation scenarios. Project page is available at:

Abstract: Forecasting attracts a lot of research attention in the electricity value
chain. However, most studies concentrate on short-term forecasting of
generation or consumption with a focus on systems and less on individual
consumers. Even more neglected is the topic of long-term forecasting of
individual power consumption.
  Here, we provide an in-depth comparative evaluation of data-driven methods
for generating synthetic time series data tailored to energy consumption
long-term forecasting. High-fidelity synthetic data is crucial for a wide range
of applications, including state estimations in energy systems or power grid
planning. In this study, we assess and compare the performance of multiple
state-of-the-art but less common techniques: a hybrid Wasserstein Generative
Adversarial Network (WGAN), Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM),
Hidden Markov Model (HMM), and Masked Autoregressive Bernstein polynomial
normalizing Flows (MABF). We analyze the ability of each method to replicate
the temporal dynamics, long-range dependencies, and probabilistic transitions
characteristic of individual energy consumption profiles. Our comparative
evaluation highlights the strengths and limitations of: WGAN, DDPM, HMM and
MABF aiding in selecting the most suitable approach for state estimations and
other energy-related tasks. Our generation and analysis framework aims to
enhance the accuracy and reliability of synthetic power consumption data while
generating data that fulfills criteria like anonymisation - preserving privacy
concerns mitigating risks of specific profiling of single customers. This study
utilizes an open-source dataset from households in Germany with 15min time
resolution. The generated synthetic power profiles can readily be used in
applications like state estimations or consumption forecasting.

Motivation: 在机器学习中，模型多重性（MM）导致不同模型对同一输入的预测结果不一致，使得反事实解释（CEs）的鲁棒性成为问题。

Method: 提出了一种基于计算论证的论证集成方法，显式表示模型和反事实之间的冲突，并通过论证语义解决冲突。

Result: 理论分析表明该方法在四种论证语义下表现良好，实证研究验证了其满足六种理想性质。

Conclusion: 论证集成方法能有效解决MM下的CE鲁棒性问题，并支持模型偏好的定制。

Abstract: In machine learning, it is common to obtain multiple equally performing
models for the same prediction task, e.g., when training neural networks with
different random seeds. Model multiplicity (MM) is the situation which arises
when these competing models differ in their predictions for the same input, for
which ensembling is often employed to determine an aggregation of the outputs.
Providing recourse recommendations via counterfactual explanations (CEs) under
MM thus becomes complex, since the CE may not be valid across all models, i.e.,
the CEs are not robust under MM. In this work, we formalise the problem of
providing recourse under MM, which we name recourse-aware ensembling (RAE). We
propose the idea that under MM, CEs for each individual model should be
considered alongside their predictions so that the aggregated prediction and
recourse are decided in tandem. Centred around this intuition, we introduce six
desirable properties for solutions to this problem. For solving RAE, we propose
a novel argumentative ensembling method which guarantees the robustness of CEs
under MM. Specifically, our method leverages computational argumentation to
explicitly represent the conflicts between models and counterfactuals regarding
prediction results and CE validity. It then uses argumentation semantics to
resolve the conflicts and obtain the final solution, in a manner which is
parametric to the chosen semantics. Our method also allows for the
specification of preferences over the models under MM, allowing further
customisation of the ensemble. In a comprehensive theoretical analysis, we
characterise the behaviour of argumentative ensembling with four different
argumentation semantics. We then empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach in satisfying desirable properties with eight instantiations of
our method. (Abstract is shortened for arXiv.)

Motivation: 模仿学习在有限演示下难以准确学习专家策略，且需要探索环境以实现超越专家性能。

Method: ILDE算法结合乐观策略优化（奖励高不确定性状态-动作对）和好奇心驱动探索（偏离演示轨迹的状态）。

Result: 实验显示ILDE在样本效率上优于现有算法，并在Atari和MuJoCo任务中以较少演示实现超越专家性能。

Conclusion: ILDE作为一种不确定性正则化策略优化方法，具有乐观探索特性，理论证明其遗憾增长低于线性。

Abstract: Imitation learning is a central problem in reinforcement learning where the
goal is to learn a policy that mimics the expert's behavior. In practice, it is
often challenging to learn the expert policy from a limited number of
demonstrations accurately due to the complexity of the state space. Moreover,
it is essential to explore the environment and collect data to achieve
beyond-expert performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel
imitation learning algorithm called Imitation Learning with Double Exploration
(ILDE), which implements exploration in two aspects: (1) optimistic policy
optimization via an exploration bonus that rewards state-action pairs with high
uncertainty to potentially improve the convergence to the expert policy, and
(2) curiosity-driven exploration of the states that deviate from the
demonstration trajectories to potentially yield beyond-expert performance.
Empirically, we demonstrate that ILDE outperforms the state-of-the-art
imitation learning algorithms in terms of sample efficiency and achieves
beyond-expert performance on Atari and MuJoCo tasks with fewer demonstrations
than in previous work. We also provide a theoretical justification of ILDE as
an uncertainty-regularized policy optimization method with optimistic
exploration, leading to a regret growing sublinearly in the number of episodes.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种双级重要性保护机制（DipSVD），通过局部和全局重要性保护，优化SVD压缩方法，显著提升压缩模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的计算需求和部署成本不断增长，现有SVD压缩方法忽视矩阵关键组件的保护，导致压缩模型性能下降。

Method: 提出局部重要性保护（通过通道加权数据白化保留关键奇异向量）和全局重要性保护（通过启发式或优化方法分配压缩负担）。

Result: DipSVD在多个基准测试中优于现有SVD压缩方法，尤其在高压缩比下表现优异。

Conclusion: DipSVD通过双级保护机制显著提升SVD压缩效果，为LLMs的高效部署提供了新思路。

Abstract: The ever-increasing computational demands and deployment costs of large
language models (LLMs) have spurred numerous compressing methods. Compared to
quantization and unstructured pruning, SVD compression offers superior hardware
compatibility and theoretical guarantees. However, existing SVD-based methods
focus on the overall discrepancy between the original and compressed matrices
while overlooking the protection of critical components within the matrix,
which leads to inferior performance in the compressed models. This paper
proposes a dual-level importance protection mechanism to enhance SVD-based
compression methods: (1) local importance protection: preserving the most
critical singular vectors within each weight matrix through channel-weighted
data whitening; and (2) global importance protection: enabling less important
layers to bear a greater portion of the compression burden through either a
heuristic or optimization-based approach, thereby minimizing the impact of
compression on critical layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DipSVD
outperforms existing SVD-based compression approaches across multiple
benchmarks, achieving superior model performance especially at high model
compression ratios.

Conclusion: MVPA是一种通用注意力机制，MVPFormer是首个开源、开放权重的iEEG基础模型，具有临床领先性能。

Abstract: Learning from multi-variate time-series with heterogeneous channel
configurations remains a fundamental challenge for deep neural networks (DNNs),
particularly in clinical domains such as intracranial electroencephalography
(iEEG), where channel setups vary widely across subjects. In this work, we
introduce multi-variate parallel attention (MVPA), a novel self-attention
mechanism that disentangles content, temporal, and spatial attention, enabling
flexible, generalizable, and efficient modeling of time-series data with
varying channel counts and configurations. We use MVPA to build MVPFormer, a
generative foundation model for human electrophysiology, trained to predict the
evolution of iEEG signals across diverse subjects. To support this and future
effort by the community, we release the SWEC iEEG dataset, the largest publicly
available iEEG dataset to date, comprising nearly 10,000 hours of recordings
from heterogeneous clinical sources. MVPFormer leverages MVPA to achieve strong
generalization across subjects, demonstrating expert-level performance in
seizure detection and outperforming state-of-the-art Transformer baselines on
our SWEC, the MAYO, and the FNUSA dataset. We further validate MVPA on standard
time-series forecasting and classification tasks, where it matches or exceeds
existing attention-based models. Together, our contributions establish MVPA as
a general-purpose attention mechanism for heterogeneous time-series and
MVPFormer as the first open-source, open-weights, and open-data iEEG foundation
model with state-of-the-art clinical performance. The code is available at

Method: 结合拉普拉斯信号和谱引导优化，采用对抗性自举训练增强特征学习和鲁棒性。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上表现优于现有自监督图学习方法。

Conclusion: LaplaceGNN为高效学习图表示提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: We present LaplaceGNN, a novel self-supervised graph learning framework that
bypasses the need for negative sampling by leveraging spectral bootstrapping
techniques. Our method integrates Laplacian-based signals into the learning
process, allowing the model to effectively capture rich structural
representations without relying on contrastive objectives or handcrafted
augmentations. By focusing on positive alignment, LaplaceGNN achieves linear
scaling while offering a simpler, more efficient, self-supervised alternative
for graph neural networks, applicable across diverse domains. Our contributions
are twofold: we precompute spectral augmentations through max-min
centrality-guided optimization, enabling rich structural supervision without
relying on handcrafted augmentations, then we integrate an adversarial
bootstrapped training scheme that further strengthens feature learning and
robustness. Our extensive experiments on different benchmark datasets show that
LaplaceGNN achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art
self-supervised graph methods, offering a promising direction for efficiently
learning expressive graph representations.

Conclusion: P4为IoT设备提供了一种高效、隐私保护且抗攻击的个性化学习解决方案。

Abstract: The growing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Internet of Things
(IoT) ecosystems has intensified the need for personalized learning methods
that can operate efficiently and privately across heterogeneous,
resource-constrained devices. However, enabling effective personalized learning
in decentralized settings introduces several challenges, including efficient
knowledge transfer between clients, protection of data privacy, and resilience
against poisoning attacks. In this paper, we address these challenges by
developing P4 (Personalized, Private, Peer-to-Peer) -- a method designed to
deliver personalized models for resource-constrained IoT devices while ensuring
differential privacy and robustness against poisoning attacks. Our solution
employs a lightweight, fully decentralized algorithm to privately detect client
similarity and form collaborative groups. Within each group, clients leverage
differentially private knowledge distillation to co-train their models,
maintaining high accuracy while ensuring robustness to the presence of
malicious clients. We evaluate P4 on popular benchmark datasets using both
linear and CNN-based architectures across various heterogeneity settings and
attack scenarios. Experimental results show that P4 achieves 5% to 30% higher
accuracy than leading differentially private peer-to-peer approaches and
maintains robustness with up to 30% malicious clients. Additionally, we
demonstrate its practicality by deploying it on resource-constrained devices,
where collaborative training between two clients adds only ~7 seconds of
overhead.

Motivation: 在非平稳环境中（如电子商务推荐系统），现有方法假设环境是静态的或依赖严格的奖励建模假设，导致显著偏差。需要一种新方法来准确估计和优化未来策略价值。

Method: 提出了OPFV估计器，通过新型重要性加权利用时间序列数据的结构（如季节性、周效应等），并扩展为策略梯度方法以主动学习未来策略。

Result: 理论分析表明OPFV在特定条件下具有低偏差，实证结果显示其在非平稳环境中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: OPFV为未来策略评估和学习提供了有效工具，尤其在非平稳环境中表现优异。

Abstract: We study the novel problem of future off-policy evaluation (F-OPE) and
learning (F-OPL) for estimating and optimizing the future value of policies in
non-stationary environments, where distributions vary over time. In e-commerce
recommendations, for instance, our goal is often to estimate and optimize the
policy value for the upcoming month using data collected by an old policy in
the previous month. A critical challenge is that data related to the future
environment is not observed in the historical data. Existing methods assume
stationarity or depend on restrictive reward-modeling assumptions, leading to
significant bias. To address these limitations, we propose a novel estimator
named \textit{\textbf{O}ff-\textbf{P}olicy Estimator for the \textbf{F}uture
\textbf{V}alue (\textbf{\textit{OPFV}})}, designed for accurately estimating
policy values at any future time point. The key feature of OPFV is its ability
to leverage the useful structure within time-series data. While future data
might not be present in the historical log, we can leverage, for example,
seasonal, weekly, or holiday effects that are consistent in both the historical
and future data. Our estimator is the first to exploit these time-related
structures via a new type of importance weighting, enabling effective F-OPE.
Theoretical analysis identifies the conditions under which OPFV becomes
low-bias. In addition, we extend our estimator to develop a new policy-gradient
method to proactively learn a good future policy using only historical data.
Empirical results show that our methods substantially outperform existing
methods in estimating and optimizing the future policy value under
non-stationarity for various experimental setups.

Abstract: A fundamental question in applying In-Context Learning (ICL) for tabular data
classification is how to determine the ideal number of demonstrations in the
prompt. This work addresses this challenge by presenting an algorithm to
automatically select a reasonable number of required demonstrations. Our method
distinguishes itself by integrating not only the tabular data's distribution
but also the user's selected prompt template and the specific Large Language
Model (LLM) into its estimation. Rooted in Spectral Graph Theory, our proposed
algorithm defines a novel metric to quantify the similarities between different
demonstrations. We then construct a similarity graph and analyze the
eigenvalues of its Laplacian to derive the minimum number of demonstrations
capable of representing the data within the LLM's intrinsic representation
space. We validate the efficacy of our approach through experiments comparing
its performance against conventional random selection algorithms on diverse
datasets and LLMs.

Result: 实验表明，使用AMDA增强数据训练的NILM模型在能耗分解任务中表现优异，归一化分解误差为0.093，优于未使用数据增强（0.451）和随机数据增强（0.290）的模型。

Conclusion: SIDED和AMDA方法有效解决了工业NILM中的数据稀缺和隐私问题，并显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Industrial Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is limited by the scarcity of
high-quality datasets and the complex variability of industrial energy
consumption patterns. To address data scarcity and privacy issues, we introduce
the Synthetic Industrial Dataset for Energy Disaggregation (SIDED), an
open-source dataset generated using Digital Twin simulations. SIDED includes
three types of industrial facilities across three different geographic
locations, capturing diverse appliance behaviors, weather conditions, and load
profiles. We also propose the Appliance-Modulated Data Augmentation (AMDA)
method, a computationally efficient technique that enhances NILM model
generalization by intelligently scaling appliance power contributions based on
their relative impact. We show in experiments that NILM models trained with
AMDA-augmented data significantly improve the disaggregation of energy
consumption of complex industrial appliances like combined heat and power
systems. Specifically, in our out-of-sample scenarios, models trained with AMDA
achieved a Normalized Disaggregation Error of 0.093, outperforming models
trained without data augmentation (0.451) and those trained with random data
augmentation (0.290). Data distribution analyses confirm that AMDA effectively
aligns training and test data distributions, enhancing model generalization.

Motivation: 现有方法多基于文本域或依赖不现实假设（如预定义问题文件或完全可观察性），PSALM-V旨在动态推断PDDL问题文件和动作语义，适应部分观察和实际环境。

Method: 系统通过分析执行结果和合成可能的错误解释，动态生成PDDL问题文件和动作语义，迭代生成和执行计划，维护树状信念结构以逐步优化动作语义。

Result: 在ALFRED任务中，计划成功率从37%提升至74%；在RTFM和Overcooked-AI中提升步骤效率并实现多智能体域归纳；在机器人BlocksWorld任务中成功推断PDDL条件。

Conclusion: PSALM-V在部分观察和多智能体环境中高效推断符号动作语义，显著提升任务完成率，展示了神经符号学习在实际应用中的潜力。

Abstract: We propose PSALM-V, the first autonomous neuro-symbolic learning system able
to induce symbolic action semantics (i.e., pre- and post-conditions) in visual
environments through interaction. PSALM-V bootstraps reliable symbolic planning
without expert action definitions, using LLMs to generate heuristic plans and
candidate symbolic semantics. Previous work has explored using large language
models to generate action semantics for Planning Domain Definition Language
(PDDL)-based symbolic planners. However, these approaches have primarily
focused on text-based domains or relied on unrealistic assumptions, such as
access to a predefined problem file, full observability, or explicit error
messages. By contrast, PSALM-V dynamically infers PDDL problem files and domain
action semantics by analyzing execution outcomes and synthesizing possible
error explanations. The system iteratively generates and executes plans while
maintaining a tree-structured belief over possible action semantics for each
action, iteratively refining these beliefs until a goal state is reached.
Simulated experiments of task completion in ALFRED demonstrate that PSALM-V
increases the plan success rate from 37% (Claude-3.7) to 74% in partially
observed setups. Results on two 2D game environments, RTFM and Overcooked-AI,
show that PSALM-V improves step efficiency and succeeds in domain induction in
multi-agent settings. PSALM-V correctly induces PDDL pre- and post-conditions
for real-world robot BlocksWorld tasks, despite low-level manipulation failures
from the robot.

Motivation: 人机交互中检测沟通错误对维持用户参与和信任至关重要，但机器人难以通过非语言反馈识别错误。

Method: 使用包含240段人机对话的多模态数据集，引入四种对话失败类型，评估计算机视觉模型的性能。

Result: 模型在识别沟通错误时表现不佳，仅略优于随机猜测；但在情感表达更丰富的数据集上能成功识别困惑状态。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了识别机器人对话错误的根本限制，即用户即使感知到错误也常未反馈，这有助于优化人机对话设计。

Abstract: Detecting miscommunication in human-robot interaction is a critical function
for maintaining user engagement and trust. While humans effortlessly detect
communication errors in conversations through both verbal and non-verbal cues,
robots face significant challenges in interpreting non-verbal feedback, despite
advances in computer vision for recognizing affective expressions. This
research evaluates the effectiveness of machine learning models in detecting
miscommunications in robot dialogue. Using a multi-modal dataset of 240
human-robot conversations, where four distinct types of conversational failures
were systematically introduced, we assess the performance of state-of-the-art
computer vision models. After each conversational turn, users provided feedback
on whether they perceived an error, enabling an analysis of the models' ability
to accurately detect robot mistakes. Despite using state-of-the-art models, the
performance barely exceeds random chance in identifying miscommunication, while
on a dataset with more expressive emotional content, they successfully
identified confused states. To explore the underlying cause, we asked human
raters to do the same. They could also only identify around half of the induced
miscommunications, similarly to our model. These results uncover a fundamental
limitation in identifying robot miscommunications in dialogue: even when users
perceive the induced miscommunication as such, they often do not communicate
this to their robotic conversation partner. This knowledge can shape
expectations of the performance of computer vision models and can help
researchers to design better human-robot conversations by deliberately
eliciting feedback where needed.

Result: 网络能从多样化的物体中学习，共同训练有助于提升性能。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效预测抓取成功率，多样化物体训练对目标有贡献。

Abstract: Deep object pose estimators are notoriously overconfident. A grasping agent
that both estimates the 6-DoF pose of a target object and predicts the
uncertainty of its own estimate could avoid task failure by choosing not to act
under high uncertainty. Even though object pose estimation improves and
uncertainty quantification research continues to make strides, few studies have
connected them to the downstream task of robotic grasping. We propose a method
for training lightweight, deep networks to predict whether a grasp guided by an
image-based pose estimate will succeed before that grasp is attempted. We
generate training data for our networks via object pose estimation on real
images and simulated grasping. We also find that, despite high object
variability in grasping trials, networks benefit from training on all objects
jointly, suggesting that a diverse variety of objects can nevertheless
contribute to the same goal.

Conclusion: 分层强化学习框架显著提升了四足机器人在复杂地形上的运动性能。

Abstract: We propose a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning framework for
quadruped locomotion over challenging terrain. Our approach incorporates a
two-layer hierarchy in which a high-level policy (HLP) selects optimal goals
for a low-level policy (LLP). The LLP is trained using an on-policy
actor-critic RL algorithm and is given footstep placements as goals. We propose
an HLP that does not require any additional training or environment samples and
instead operates via an online optimization process over the learned value
function of the LLP. We demonstrate the benefits of this framework by comparing
it with an end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) approach. We observe
improvements in its ability to achieve higher rewards with fewer collisions
across an array of different terrains, including terrains more difficult than
any encountered during training.

Abstract: We present a novel approach for enhancing robotic exploration by using
generative occupancy mapping. We introduce SceneSense, a diffusion model
designed and trained for predicting 3D occupancy maps given partial
observations. Our proposed approach probabilistically fuses these predictions
into a running occupancy map in real-time, resulting in significant
improvements in map quality and traversability. We implement SceneSense onboard
a quadruped robot and validate its performance with real-world experiments to
demonstrate the effectiveness of the model. In these experiments, we show that
occupancy maps enhanced with SceneSense predictions better represent our fully
observed ground truth data (24.44% FID improvement around the robot and 75.59%
improvement at range). We additionally show that integrating
SceneSense-enhanced maps into our robotic exploration stack as a "drop-in" map
improvement, utilizing an existing off-the-shelf planner, results in
improvements in robustness and traversability time. Finally we show results of
full exploration evaluations with our proposed system in two dissimilar
environments and find that locally enhanced maps provide more consistent
exploration results than maps constructed only from direct sensor measurements.

Motivation: 研究VLMs在实时人机交互（HRI）中的人类感知能力及其性能与延迟的权衡，以提升用户体验和实际应用。

Method: 构建HRIBench基准测试，包含1000个视觉问答（VQA）问题，覆盖五个领域，并评估11种开源和闭源VLMs的性能与延迟。

Result: 当前VLMs在核心人类感知能力上表现不足，且未能在性能与延迟之间找到平衡，不适合实时部署。

Conclusion: 未来需开发更小、低延迟且具备更强人类感知能力的VLMs，HRIBench为此提供了评估工具。

Abstract: Real-time human perception is crucial for effective human-robot interaction
(HRI). Large vision-language models (VLMs) offer promising generalizable
perceptual capabilities but often suffer from high latency, which negatively
impacts user experience and limits VLM applicability in real-world scenarios.
To systematically study VLM capabilities in human perception for HRI and
performance-latency trade-offs, we introduce HRIBench, a visual
question-answering (VQA) benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs across a diverse
set of human perceptual tasks critical for HRI. HRIBench covers five key
domains: (1) non-verbal cue understanding, (2) verbal instruction
understanding, (3) human-robot object relationship understanding, (4) social
navigation, and (5) person identification. To construct HRIBench, we collected
data from real-world HRI environments to curate questions for non-verbal cue
understanding, and leveraged publicly available datasets for the remaining four
domains. We curated 200 VQA questions for each domain, resulting in a total of
1000 questions for HRIBench. We then conducted a comprehensive evaluation of
both state-of-the-art closed-source and open-source VLMs (N=11) on HRIBench.
Our results show that, despite their generalizability, current VLMs still
struggle with core perceptual capabilities essential for HRI. Moreover, none of
the models within our experiments demonstrated a satisfactory
performance-latency trade-off suitable for real-time deployment, underscoring

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高机械臂在认知机器人实验中的可预测性和精确性，特别是在与人类互动时。

Conclusion: 该方法具有广泛适用性，能够生成高精度的机械臂轨迹。

Abstract: We introduce a neural network approach for generating and customizing the
trajectory of a robotic arm, that guarantees precision and repeatability. To
highlight the potential of this novel method, we describe the design and
implementation of the technique and show its application in an experimental
setting of cognitive robotics. In this scenario, the NICO robot was
characterized by the ability to point to specific points in space with precise
linear movements, increasing the predictability of the robotic action during
its interaction with humans. To achieve this goal, the neural network computes
the forward kinematics of the robot arm. By integrating it with a generator of
joint angles, another neural network was developed and trained on an artificial
dataset created from suitable start and end poses of the robotic arm. Through
the computation of angular velocities, the robot was characterized by its
ability to perform the movement, and the quality of its action was evaluated in
terms of shape and accuracy. Thanks to its broad applicability, our approach
successfully generates precise trajectories that could be customized in their
shape and adapted to different settings.

TL;DR: CARMA是一个用于人机群体交互中情境感知的系统，通过唯一标识实体并组织成行动者-对象-动作三元组，实现协作中的时空推理和决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在群体交互中，机器人需要情境感知能力，以正确识别和跟踪行动者、对象及其交互，从而支持有效协作。

Method: CARMA通过唯一标识物理实体并将其组织成行动者-对象-动作三元组，实现情境感知。实验验证了其在协作场景中的能力。

Result: 实验表明，CARMA能可靠生成准确的三元组，为协作中的时空推理和决策提供结构化基础。

Conclusion: CARMA为群体协作中的情境感知和决策提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce CARMA, a system for situational grounding in human-robot group
interactions. Effective collaboration in such group settings requires
situational awareness based on a consistent representation of present persons
and objects coupled with an episodic abstraction of events regarding actors and
manipulated objects. This calls for a clear and consistent assignment of
instances, ensuring that robots correctly recognize and track actors, objects,
and their interactions over time. To achieve this, CARMA uniquely identifies
physical instances of such entities in the real world and organizes them into
grounded triplets of actors, objects, and actions.
  To validate our approach, we conducted three experiments, where multiple
humans and a robot interact: collaborative pouring, handovers, and sorting.
These scenarios allow the assessment of the system's capabilities as to role
distinction, multi-actor awareness, and consistent instance identification. Our
experiments demonstrate that the system can reliably generate accurate
actor-action-object triplets, providing a structured and robust foundation for
applications requiring spatiotemporal reasoning and situated decision-making in
collaborative settings.

Conclusion: FundaQ-8框架为质量评估提供标准化方法，增强深度学习模型在真实筛查中的实用性。

Abstract: Automated fundus image quality assessment (FIQA) remains a challenge due to
variations in image acquisition and subjective expert evaluations. We introduce
FundaQ-8, a novel expert-validated framework for systematically assessing
fundus image quality using eight critical parameters, including field coverage,
anatomical visibility, illumination, and image artifacts. Using FundaQ-8 as a
structured scoring reference, we develop a ResNet18-based regression model to
predict continuous quality scores in the 0 to 1 range. The model is trained on
1800 fundus images from real-world clinical sources and Kaggle datasets, using
transfer learning, mean squared error optimization, and standardized
preprocessing. Validation against the EyeQ dataset and statistical analyses
confirm the framework's reliability and clinical interpretability.
Incorporating FundaQ-8 into deep learning models for diabetic retinopathy
grading also improves diagnostic robustness, highlighting the value of
quality-aware training in real-world screening applications.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: VoxelOpt 是一种结合学习与迭代方法的变形图像配准框架，通过位移熵和多级图像金字塔优化，在精度和速度上取得平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决学习型方法在数据少、大变形和无监督时的不足，以及迭代方法速度慢的问题。

Method: 使用位移熵测量信号强度，引入体素自适应消息传递、多级图像金字塔和预训练分割模型。

Result: 在腹部 CT 配准中，VoxelOpt 在效率和精度上均优于迭代方法，并匹敌有监督学习型方法。

Conclusion: VoxelOpt 通过创新设计，实现了配准精度与运行时间的优化平衡。

Abstract: Recent developments in neural networks have improved deformable image
registration (DIR) by amortizing iterative optimization, enabling fast and
accurate DIR results. However, learning-based methods often face challenges
with limited training data, large deformations, and tend to underperform
compared to iterative approaches when label supervision is unavailable. While
iterative methods can achieve higher accuracy in such scenarios, they are
considerably slower than learning-based methods. To address these limitations,
we propose VoxelOpt, a discrete optimization-based DIR framework that combines
the strengths of learning-based and iterative methods to achieve a better
balance between registration accuracy and runtime. VoxelOpt uses displacement
entropy from local cost volumes to measure displacement signal strength at each
voxel, which differs from earlier approaches in three key aspects. First, it
introduces voxel-wise adaptive message passing, where voxels with lower entropy
receives less influence from their neighbors. Second, it employs a multi-level
image pyramid with 27-neighbor cost volumes at each level, avoiding exponential
complexity growth. Third, it replaces hand-crafted features or contrastive
learning with a pretrained foundational segmentation model for feature
extraction. In abdominal CT registration, these changes allow VoxelOpt to
outperform leading iterative in both efficiency and accuracy, while matching
state-of-the-art learning-based methods trained with label supervision. The

TL;DR: 提出了一种多尺度特征融合网络MS-IQA，用于PET/CT图像质量评估，结合高低层特征，并在新构建的数据集上验证了其优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学图像质量评估方法无法同时考虑高低层特征，导致诊断不确定性增加。

Method: 利用ResNet和Swin Transformer的多尺度特征，结合动态加权通道注意力机制，提出MS-IQA网络。

Result: 在PET-CT-IQA-DS和LDCTIQAC2023数据集上，MS-IQA在多种IQA指标上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MS-IQA为PET/CT提供了一种准确高效的图像质量评估方法，填补了相关数据集的空白。

Abstract: Positron Emission Tomography / Computed Tomography (PET/CT) plays a critical
role in medical imaging, combining functional and anatomical information to aid
in accurate diagnosis. However, image quality degradation due to noise,
compression and other factors could potentially lead to diagnostic uncertainty
and increase the risk of misdiagnosis. When evaluating the quality of a PET/CT
image, both low-level features like distortions and high-level features like
organ anatomical structures affect the diagnostic value of the image. However,
existing medical image quality assessment (IQA) methods are unable to account
for both feature types simultaneously. In this work, we propose MS-IQA, a novel
multi-scale feature fusion network for PET/CT IQA, which utilizes multi-scale
features from various intermediate layers of ResNet and Swin Transformer,
enhancing its ability of perceiving both local and global information. In
addition, a multi-scale feature fusion module is also introduced to effectively
combine high-level and low-level information through a dynamically weighted
channel attention mechanism. Finally, to fill the blank of PET/CT IQA dataset,
we construct PET-CT-IQA-DS, a dataset containing 2,700 varying-quality PET/CT
images with quality scores assigned by radiologists. Experiments on our dataset
and the publicly available LDCTIQAC2023 dataset demonstrate that our proposed
model has achieved superior performance against existing state-of-the-art
methods in various IQA metrics. This work provides an accurate and efficient
IQA method for PET/CT. Our code and dataset are available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 骨质疏松症诊断在资源有限地区面临挑战，现有CT分析方法存在未标记数据利用不足、设备偏差和临床知识整合不足的局限性。

Method: 采用自监督学习利用未标记CT数据，混合专家架构增强跨设备适应性，多任务学习整合骨质疏松诊断、BMD回归和椎骨定位预测。

Result: 在三个临床站点和外部医院验证，显示出优于现有方法的泛化能力和准确性。

Conclusion: 该框架为骨质疏松症的筛查和诊断提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Osteoporosis, characterized by reduced bone mineral density (BMD) and
compromised bone microstructure, increases fracture risk in aging populations.
While dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is the clinical standard for BMD
assessment, its limited accessibility hinders diagnosis in resource-limited
regions. Opportunistic computed tomography (CT) analysis has emerged as a
promising alternative for osteoporosis diagnosis using existing imaging data.
Current approaches, however, face three limitations: (1) underutilization of
unlabeled vertebral data, (2) systematic bias from device-specific DXA
discrepancies, and (3) insufficient integration of clinical knowledge such as
spatial BMD distribution patterns. To address these, we propose a unified deep
learning framework with three innovations. First, a self-supervised learning
method using radiomic representations to leverage unlabeled CT data and
preserve bone texture. Second, a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture with
learned gating mechanisms to enhance cross-device adaptability. Third, a
multi-task learning framework integrating osteoporosis diagnosis, BMD
regression, and vertebra location prediction. Validated across three clinical
sites and an external hospital, our approach demonstrates superior
generalizability and accuracy over existing methods for opportunistic
osteoporosis screening and diagnosis.

TL;DR: 提出EAGLE网络，结合PVSS编码器和HVSS解码器，用于高效准确分割肝包虫病（HE）病灶，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决肝包虫病在医疗资源有限地区的诊断问题，同时克服CNN和Transformer在医学图像分割中的局限性。

Method: 采用U形网络结构，结合PVSS编码器和HVSS解码器，引入CVSSB模块融合局部与全局特征，HWTB模块实现无损下采样。

Result: 在自建数据集上，EAGLE的Dice相似系数达89.76%，优于MSVM-UNet 1.61%。

Conclusion: EAGLE在肝包虫病病灶分割中表现出色，为资源有限地区提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Hepatic echinococcosis (HE) is a widespread parasitic disease in
underdeveloped pastoral areas with limited medical resources. While CNN-based
and Transformer-based models have been widely applied to medical image
segmentation, CNNs lack global context modeling due to local receptive fields,
and Transformers, though capable of capturing long-range dependencies, are
computationally expensive. Recently, state space models (SSMs), such as Mamba,
have gained attention for their ability to model long sequences with linear
complexity. In this paper, we propose EAGLE, a U-shaped network composed of a
Progressive Visual State Space (PVSS) encoder and a Hybrid Visual State Space
(HVSS) decoder that work collaboratively to achieve efficient and accurate
segmentation of hepatic echinococcosis (HE) lesions. The proposed Convolutional
Vision State Space Block (CVSSB) module is designed to fuse local and global
features, while the Haar Wavelet Transformation Block (HWTB) module compresses
spatial information into the channel dimension to enable lossless downsampling.
Due to the lack of publicly available HE datasets, we collected CT slices from
260 patients at a local hospital. Experimental results show that EAGLE achieves
state-of-the-art performance with a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of
89.76%, surpassing MSVM-UNet by 1.61%.

Motivation: 手动测量胎儿生物特征依赖操作者且耗时，临床需要自动计算机辅助方法。

Method: 结合深度学习模型提取的深度表征和放射组学特征，融合后估计GA。

Result: 在三孕期平均绝对误差为8.0天，优于现有机器学习方法，且在不同地理区域人群中表现稳健。

Conclusion: 该框架为GA估计提供了一种高效、自动化的解决方案，具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Accurate gestational age (GA) estimation, ideally through fetal ultrasound
measurement, is a crucial aspect of providing excellent antenatal care.
However, deriving GA from manual fetal biometric measurements depends on the
operator and is time-consuming. Hence, automatic computer-assisted methods are
demanded in clinical practice. In this paper, we present a novel feature fusion
framework to estimate GA using fetal ultrasound images without any measurement
information. We adopt a deep learning model to extract deep representations
from ultrasound images. We extract radiomic features to reveal patterns and
characteristics of fetal brain growth. To harness the interpretability of
radiomics in medical imaging analysis, we estimate GA by fusing radiomic
features and deep representations. Our framework estimates GA with a mean
absolute error of 8.0 days across three trimesters, outperforming current
machine learning-based methods at these gestational ages. Experimental results
demonstrate the robustness of our framework across different populations in
diverse geographical regions. Our code is publicly available on

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为加权平均频率（WMF）的新特征，用于4D Flow MRI图像的可视化，显著提升了分割任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D Flow MRI图像的分辨率低和噪声问题影响了生物标志物的准确性，尤其是壁剪切应力。现有方法PC-MRA虽先进，但仍需改进。

Method: 引入WMF特征，揭示三维空间中脉动流经过的体素区域，并通过阈值优化和深度学习方法进行分割实验。

Result: 实验显示，WMF特征在IoU和Dice指标上分别提升了0.12和0.13，优于PC-MRA特征。

Conclusion: WMF特征有望为其他血管区域（如心脏或大脑）的分割提供新思路。

Abstract: In recent decades, the use of 4D Flow MRI images has enabled the
quantification of velocity fields within a volume of interest and along the
cardiac cycle. However, the lack of resolution and the presence of noise in
these biomarkers are significant issues. As indicated by recent studies, it
appears that biomarkers such as wall shear stress are particularly impacted by
the poor resolution of vessel segmentation. The Phase Contrast Magnetic
Resonance Angiography (PC-MRA) is the state-of-the-art method to facilitate
segmentation. The objective of this work is to introduce a new handcraft
feature that provides a novel visualisation of 4D Flow MRI images, which is
useful in the segmentation task. This feature, termed Weighted Mean Frequencies
(WMF), is capable of revealing the region in three dimensions where a voxel has
been passed by pulsatile flow. Indeed, this feature is representative of the
hull of all pulsatile velocity voxels. The value of the feature under
discussion is illustrated by two experiments. The experiments involved
segmenting 4D Flow MRI images using optimal thresholding and deep learning
methods. The results obtained demonstrate a substantial enhancement in terms of
IoU and Dice, with a respective increase of 0.12 and 0.13 in comparison with
the PC-MRA feature, as evidenced by the deep learning task. This feature has
the potential to yield valuable insights that could inform future segmentation
processes in other vascular regions, such as the heart or the brain.

Motivation: 研究旨在利用QNNs改进倾向评分估计，以消除生存分析中的选择偏差，特别是在小样本和高维数据的情况下。

Method: 使用QNN架构，包括线性ZFeatureMap编码、SummedPaulis预测算子和CMA-ES优化，结合方差正则化处理量子噪声。

Result: QNNs在小样本中表现优于经典方法（AUC达0.750），倾向评分匹配和加权后协变量平衡良好，生存分析未显示显著差异。

Conclusion: QNNs结合CMA-ES和噪声感知策略，在生物医学研究中具有改进因果推断的潜力。

Abstract: This study investigates the application of quantum neural networks (QNNs) for
propensity score estimation to address selection bias in comparing survival
outcomes between laparoscopic and open surgical techniques in a cohort of 1177
colorectal carcinoma patients treated at University Hospital Ostrava
(2001-2009). Using a dataset with 77 variables, including patient demographics
and tumor characteristics, we developed QNN-based propensity score models
focusing on four key covariates (Age, Sex, Stage, BMI). The QNN architecture
employed a linear ZFeatureMap for data encoding, a SummedPaulis operator for
predictions, and the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES)
for robust, gradient-free optimization in noisy quantum environments. Variance
regularization was integrated to mitigate quantum measurement noise, with
simulations conducted under exact, sampling (1024 shots), and noisy hardware
(FakeManhattanV2) conditions. QNNs, particularly with simulated hardware noise,
outperformed classical logistic regression and gradient boosted machines in
small samples (AUC up to 0.750 for n=100), with noise modeling enhancing
predictive stability. Propensity score matching and weighting, optimized via
genetic matching and matching weights, achieved covariate balance with
standardized mean differences of 0.0849 and 0.0869, respectively. Survival
analyses using Kaplan-Meier estimation, Cox proportional hazards, and Aalen
additive regression revealed no significant survival differences
post-adjustment (p-values 0.287-0.851), indicating confounding bias in
unadjusted outcomes. These results highlight QNNs' potential, enhanced by
CMA-ES and noise-aware strategies, to improve causal inference in biomedical
research, particularly for small-sample, high-dimensional datasets.

Conclusion: 数据编码策略在混合量子-经典模型中起主导作用，而纯量子模型的性能更依赖于测量协议和编码映射。

Abstract: This study investigates the design choices of parameterized quantum circuits
(PQCs) within quantum and hybrid convolutional neural network (HQNN and QCNN)
architectures, applied to the task of satellite image classification using the
EuroSAT dataset. We systematically evaluate the performance implications of
data encoding techniques, variational ans\"atze, and measurement in approx. 500
distinct model configurations. Our analysis reveals a clear hierarchy of
influence on model performance. For hybrid architectures, which were
benchmarked against their direct classical equivalents (e.g. the same
architecture with the PQCs removed), the data encoding strategy is the dominant
factor, with validation accuracy varying over 30% for distinct embeddings. In
contrast, the selection of variational ans\"atze and measurement basis had a
comparatively marginal effect, with validation accuracy variations remaining
below 5%. For purely quantum models, restricted to amplitude encoding,
performance was most dependent on the measurement protocol and the
data-to-amplitude mapping. The measurement strategy varied the validation
accuracy by up to 30% and the encoding mapping by around 8 percentage points.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI, particularly large language models (LLMs), has
raised significant concerns about the energy use and carbon emissions
associated with model training and inference. However, existing tools for
measuring and reporting such impacts are often fragmented, lacking systematic
metric integration and offering limited support for correlation analysis among
them. This paper presents WattsOnAI, a comprehensive software toolkit for the
measurement, analysis, and visualization of energy use, power draw, hardware
performance, and carbon emissions across AI workloads. By seamlessly
integrating with existing AI frameworks, WattsOnAI offers standardized reports
and exports fine-grained time-series data to support benchmarking and
reproducibility in a lightweight manner. It further enables in-depth
correlation analysis between hardware metrics and model performance and thus
facilitates bottleneck identification and performance enhancement. By
addressing critical limitations in existing tools, WattsOnAI encourages the

Abstract: Team formation and the dynamics of team-based learning have drawn significant
interest in the context of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). However,
existing studies primarily focus on unilateral groupings, predefined teams, or
fixed-population settings, leaving the effects of algorithmic bilateral
grouping choices in dynamic populations underexplored. To address this gap, we
introduce a framework for learning two-sided team formation in dynamic
multi-agent systems. Through this study, we gain insight into what algorithmic
properties in bilateral team formation influence policy performance and
generalization. We validate our approach using widely adopted multi-agent
scenarios, demonstrating competitive performance and improved generalization in
most scenarios.

Abstract: Conformal prediction offers a distribution-free framework for constructing
prediction sets with coverage guarantees. In practice, multiple valid conformal
prediction sets may be available, arising from different models or

can invalidate the coverage guarantees. To address this challenge, we propose a
stability-based approach that ensures coverage for the selected prediction set.
We extend our results to the online conformal setting, propose several
refinements in settings where additional structure is available, and
demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments.

Motivation: 传统说话人跟踪方法依赖空间观测，但在说话人间歇移动时会导致轨迹不连续，因此需要一种更鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: 利用初始跟踪步骤提供的轨迹信息和多通道音频信号，通过波束成形增强信号并计算说话人嵌入，最后基于注册池重新分配身份。

Conclusion: 基于说话人嵌入的身份重新分配方法有效解决了间歇性和移动说话人跟踪问题，提升了系统性能。

Abstract: Speaker tracking methods often rely on spatial observations to assign
coherent track identities over time. This raises limits in scenarios with
intermittent and moving speakers, i.e., speakers that may change position when
they are inactive, thus leading to discontinuous spatial trajectories. This
paper proposes to investigate the use of speaker embeddings, in a simple
solution to this issue. We propose to perform identity reassignment
post-tracking, using speaker embeddings. We leverage trajectory-related
information provided by an initial tracking step and multichannel audio signal.
Beamforming is used to enhance the signal towards the speakers' positions in
order to compute speaker embeddings. These are then used to assign new track
identities based on an enrollment pool. We evaluate the performance of the
proposed speaker embedding-based identity reassignment method on a dataset
where speakers change position during inactivity periods. Results show that it
consistently improves the identity assignment performance of neural and
standard tracking systems. In particular, we study the impact of beamforming
and input duration for embedding extraction.

Abstract: This paper presents our contributions to the Speech Emotion Recognition in
Naturalistic Conditions (SERNC) Challenge, where we address categorical emotion
recognition and emotional attribute prediction. To handle the complexities of
natural speech, including intra- and inter-subject variability, we propose
Multi-level Acoustic-Textual Emotion Representation (MATER), a novel
hierarchical framework that integrates acoustic and textual features at the
word, utterance, and embedding levels. By fusing low-level lexical and acoustic
cues with high-level contextualized representations, MATER effectively captures
both fine-grained prosodic variations and semantic nuances. Additionally, we
introduce an uncertainty-aware ensemble strategy to mitigate annotator
inconsistencies, improving robustness in ambiguous emotional expressions. MATER
ranks fourth in both tasks with a Macro-F1 of 41.01% and an average CCC of
0.5928, securing second place in valence prediction with an impressive CCC of
0.6941.

### [191] [DeepQuark: deep-neural-network approach to multiquark bound states](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20555)
*Wei-Lin Wu,Lu Meng,Shi-Lin Zhu*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: 论文首次实现了基于深度神经网络的变分蒙特卡洛方法用于多夸克束缚态研究，提出高效架构DeepQuark，解决了强关联、离散量子数和禁闭相互作用等挑战，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多夸克系统的复杂性远超电子或核子系统，传统方法难以应对强SU(3)色相互作用及其带来的挑战。

Method: 设计了DeepQuark架构，结合变分蒙特卡洛方法，处理多夸克系统中的强关联、离散量子数和禁闭相互作用。

Result: 在核子、双重重四夸克和全重重四夸克系统中表现优异，尤其在三重重五夸克中超越现有计算。成功描述了分子态和紧凑态四夸克，并预测了新五夸克分子态。

Conclusion: DeepQuark为多夸克系统研究提供了高效框架，有望突破传统方法的计算限制，并为非微扰QCD和多体物理提供新见解。

Abstract: For the first time, we implement the deep-neural-network-based variational
Monte Carlo approach for the multiquark bound states, whose complexity
surpasses that of electron or nucleon systems due to strong SU(3) color
interactions. We design a novel and high-efficiency architecture, DeepQuark, to
address the unique challenges in multiquark systems such as stronger
correlations, extra discrete quantum numbers, and intractable confinement
interaction. Our method demonstrates competitive performance with
state-of-the-art approaches, including diffusion Monte Carlo and Gaussian
expansion method, in the nucleon, doubly heavy tetraquark, and fully heavy
tetraquark systems. Notably, it outperforms existing calculations for
pentaquarks, exemplified by the triply heavy pentaquark. For the nucleon, we
successfully incorporate three-body flux-tube confinement interactions without
additional computational costs. In tetraquark systems, we consistently describe
hadronic molecule $T_{cc}$ and compact tetraquark $T_{bb}$ with an unbiased
form of wave function ansatz. In the pentaquark sector, we obtain weakly bound
$\bar D^*\Xi_{cc}^*$ molecule $P_{cc\bar c}(5715)$ with $S=\frac{5}{2}$ and its
bottom partner $P_{bb\bar b}(15569)$. They can be viewed as the analogs of the
molecular $T_{cc}$. We recommend experimental search of $P_{cc\bar c}(5715)$ in
the D-wave $J/\psi \Lambda_c$ channel. DeepQuark holds great promise for
extension to larger multiquark systems, overcoming the computational barriers
in conventional methods. It also serves as a powerful framework for exploring
confining mechanism beyond two-body interactions in multiquark states, which
may offer valuable insights into nonperturbative QCD and general many-body
physics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电动汽车充电基础设施对可持续交通系统至关重要，但其在环境和基础设施压力下的韧性研究不足。

Method: 结合遥感数据、开放基础设施数据集和空间图分析，构建多模态风险评估框架，生成综合韧性评分。

Result: 在威尔士充电站数据集上验证了框架的可行性，展示了多源数据融合和空间推理的价值。

Conclusion: RSERI-EV框架支持气候韧性和基础设施感知的电动汽车部署。

Abstract: Electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure is increasingly critical to
sustainable transport systems, yet its resilience under environmental and
infrastructural stress remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce
RSERI-EV, a spatially explicit and multi-modal risk assessment framework that
combines remote sensing data, open infrastructure datasets, and spatial graph
analytics to evaluate the vulnerability of EV charging stations. RSERI-EV
integrates diverse data layers, including flood risk maps, land surface
temperature (LST) extremes, vegetation indices (NDVI), land use/land cover
(LULC), proximity to electrical substations, and road accessibility to generate
a composite Resilience Score. We apply this framework to the country of Wales
EV charger dataset to demonstrate its feasibility. A spatial $k$-nearest
neighbours ($k$NN) graph is constructed over the charging network to enable
neighbourhood-based comparisons and graph-aware diagnostics. Our prototype
highlights the value of multi-source data fusion and interpretable spatial
reasoning in supporting climate-resilient, infrastructure-aware EV deployment.

Conclusion: DualEquiNet通过双空间表示和层次化建模，有效解决了大生物分子多尺度建模的挑战，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Geometric graph neural networks (GNNs) that respect E(3) symmetries have
achieved strong performance on small molecule modeling, but they face
scalability and expressiveness challenges when applied to large biomolecules
such as RNA and proteins. These systems require models that can simultaneously
capture fine-grained atomic interactions, long-range dependencies across
spatially distant components, and biologically relevant hierarchical structure,
such as atoms forming residues, which in turn form higher-order domains.
Existing geometric GNNs, which typically operate exclusively in either
Euclidean or Spherical Harmonics space, are limited in their ability to capture
both the fine-scale atomic details and the long-range, symmetry-aware
dependencies required for modeling the multi-scale structure of large
biomolecules. We introduce DualEquiNet, a Dual-Space Hierarchical Equivariant
Network that constructs complementary representations in both Euclidean and
Spherical Harmonics spaces to capture local geometry and global symmetry-aware
features. DualEquiNet employs bidirectional cross-space message passing and a
novel Cross-Space Interaction Pooling mechanism to hierarchically aggregate
atomic features into biologically meaningful units, such as residues, enabling
efficient and expressive multi-scale modeling for large biomolecular systems.
DualEquiNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple existing
benchmarks for RNA property prediction and protein modeling, and outperforms
prior methods on two newly introduced 3D structural benchmarks demonstrating
its broad effectiveness across a range of large biomolecule modeling tasks.

Abstract: Template-based molecular generation offers a promising avenue for drug design
by ensuring generated compounds are synthetically accessible through predefined
reaction templates and building blocks. In this work, we tackle three core
challenges in template-based GFlowNets: (1) minimizing synthesis cost, (2)
scaling to large building block libraries, and (3) effectively utilizing small
fragment sets. We propose \textbf{Recursive Cost Guidance}, a backward policy
framework that employs auxiliary machine learning models to approximate
synthesis cost and viability. This guidance steers generation toward low-cost
synthesis pathways, significantly enhancing cost-efficiency, molecular
diversity, and quality, especially when paired with an \textbf{Exploitation
Penalty} that balances the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. To
enhance performance in smaller building block libraries, we develop a
\textbf{Dynamic Library} mechanism that reuses intermediate high-reward states
to construct full synthesis trees. Our approach establishes state-of-the-art
results in template-based molecular generation.
