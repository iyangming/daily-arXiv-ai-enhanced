In this\nwork, we address this issue by proposing a two-pass face aging framework, named\nCradle2Cane, based on few-step text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models.

Although existing\nrobust RL methods aim to mitigate such threats, their effectiveness has limited\ngeneralization to out-of-distribution shifts from the optimal value\ndistribution, as they are primarily designed to handle fixed perturbation. To\naddress this limitation, this paper introduces an antifragile RL framework that\nenhances adaptability to broader distributional shifts by incorporating a\nswitching mechanism based on discounted Thompson sampling (DTS). This mechanism\ndynamically selects among multiple robust policies to minimize adversarially\ninduced state-action-value distribution shifts. The proposed approach first\nderives a diverse ensemble of action robust policies by accounting for a range\nof perturbations in the policy space. These policies are then modeled as a\nmultiarmed bandit (MAB) problem, where DTS optimally selects policies in\nresponse to nonstationary Bernoulli rewards, effectively adapting to evolving\nadversarial strategies. Theoretical framework has also been provided where by\noptimizing the DTS to minimize the overall regrets due to distributional shift,\nresults in effective adaptation against unseen adversarial attacks thus\ninducing antifragility. Extensive numerical simulations validate the\neffectiveness of the proposed framework in complex navigation environments with\nmultiple dynamic three-dimensional obstacles and with stronger projected\ngradient descent (PGD) and spoofing attacks. Compared to conventional robust,\nnon-adaptive RL methods, the antifragile approach achieves superior\nperformance, demonstrating shorter navigation path lengths and a higher rate of\nconflict-free navigation trajectories compared to existing robust RL techniques", "AI": {"tldr": "本文提出了一种抗脆弱的强化学习框架，通过动态选择策略来应对无人机导航中的对抗攻击。", "motivation": "现有鲁棒强化学习方法对分布外变化的泛化能力有限，无法有效应对动态对抗攻击。", "method": "采用基于折扣汤普森采样（DTS）的切换机制，动态选择多个鲁棒策略，以最小化对抗性引起的状态-动作-值分布偏移。", "result": "在复杂导航环境中，该方法表现出更短的路径长度和更高的无冲突导航率，优于传统鲁棒强化学习方法。", "conclusion": "抗脆弱强化学习框架显著提升了无人机导航对动态对抗攻击的适应能力。"}}
