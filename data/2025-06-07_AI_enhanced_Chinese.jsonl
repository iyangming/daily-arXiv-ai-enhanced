Contrastive self-supervised\nand vision-language models have been shown to effectively mine large pathology\ndatasets to learn discriminative representations. On the other hand, generative\nmodels, capable of synthesizing realistic and diverse images, present a\ncompelling solution to address unique problems in pathology that involve\nsynthesizing images; overcoming annotated data scarcity, enabling\nprivacy-preserving data sharing, and performing inherently generative tasks,\nsuch as virtual staining. We introduce PixCell, the first diffusion-based\ngenerative foundation model for histopathology. We train PixCell on PanCan-30M,\na vast, diverse dataset derived from 69,184 H\\&E-stained whole slide images\ncovering various cancer types. We employ a progressive training strategy and a\nself-supervision-based conditioning that allows us to scale up training without\nany annotated data. PixCell generates diverse and high-quality images across\nmultiple cancer types, which we find can be used in place of real data to train\na self-supervised discriminative model. Synthetic images shared between\ninstitutions are subject to fewer regulatory barriers than would be the case\nwith real clinical images. Furthermore, we showcase the ability to precisely\ncontrol image generation using a small set of annotated images, which can be\nused for both data augmentation and educational purposes.

This fixed flow model subsequently\nregularizes the latent space via an alignment loss, which reformulates the flow\nmatching objective to treat the latents as optimization targets. We formally\nprove that minimizing this alignment loss establishes a computationally\ntractable surrogate objective for maximizing a variational lower bound on the\nlog-likelihood of latents under the target distribution.
