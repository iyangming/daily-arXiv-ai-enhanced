When an AI system is engineered for deductively\nwatertight guarantees (demonstrable certainty about the error-free nature of\nits outputs) -- as in classical symbolic AI -- its operational domain must be\nnarrowly circumscribed and pre-structured. Conversely, a system that can input\nhigh-dimensional data to produce rich information outputs -- as in contemporary\ngenerative models -- necessarily relinquishes the possibility of zero-error\nperformance, incurring an irreducible risk of errors or misclassification. By\nmaking this previously implicit trade-off explicit and open to rigorous\nverification, the conjecture significantly reframes both engineering ambitions\nand philosophical expectations for AI. After reviewing the historical\nmotivations for this tension, the article states the conjecture in\ninformation-theoretic form and contextualises it within broader debates in\nepistemology, formal verification, and the philosophy of technology. It then\noffers an analysis of its implications and consequences, drawing on notions of\nunderdetermination, prudent epistemic risk, and moral responsibility.

We answer this question with Resa,\na family of 1.5B reasoning models trained via a novel and efficient sparse\nautoencoder tuning (SAE-Tuning) procedure. This method first trains an SAE to\ncapture reasoning abilities from a source model, and then uses the trained SAE\nto guide a standard supervised fine-tuning process to elicit such abilities in\na target model, all using verified question-answer data without any reasoning\ntraces. Notably, when applied to certain base models before further RL\npost-training, SAE-Tuning retains >97% of its RL-trained counterpart's\nreasoning performance while reducing training costs by >2000x to roughly \\$1\nand training time by >450x to around 20 minutes. Furthermore, when applied to\nlightly RL-trained models (e.g., within 1 hour on 2 GPUs), it enables reasoning\nperformance such as 43.33% Pass@1 on AIME24 and 90% Pass@1 on AMC23 for only\naround \\$1 additional cost. Surprisingly, the reasoning abilities extracted via\nSAEs are potentially both generalizable and modular. Generality means abilities\nextracted from one dataset still elevate performance on a larger and\noverlapping corpus. Modularity means abilities extracted from Qwen or Qwen-Math\ncan be attached to the R1-Distill model at test time, without any retraining,\nand yield comparable gains.

Quantization is a key\ntechnique for model compression and acceleration. As an efficient approach,\nPost-Training Quantization (PTQ) is still in its nascent stages for video\nmatting, facing significant hurdles in maintaining accuracy and temporal\ncoherence. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel and general\nPTQ framework specifically designed for video matting models, marking, to the\nbest of our knowledge, the first systematic attempt in this domain. Our\ncontributions include: (1) A two-stage PTQ strategy that combines\nblock-reconstruction-based optimization for fast, stable initial quantization\nand local dependency capture, followed by a global calibration of quantization\nparameters to minimize accuracy loss. (2) A Statistically-Driven Global Affine\nCalibration (GAC) method that enables the network to compensate for cumulative\nstatistical distortions arising from factors such as neglected BN layer\neffects, even reducing the error of existing PTQ methods on video matting tasks\nup to 20%. (3) An Optical Flow Assistance (OFA) component that leverages\ntemporal and semantic priors from frames to guide the PTQ process, enhancing\nthe model's ability to distinguish moving foregrounds in complex scenes and\nultimately achieving near full-precision performance even under ultra-low-bit\nquantization. Comprehensive quantitative and visual results show that our\nPTQ4VM achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy performance across different\nbit-widths compared to the existing quantization methods. We highlight that the\n4-bit PTQ4VM even achieves performance close to the full-precision counterpart\nwhile enjoying 8x FLOP savings.", "AI": {"tldr": "本文提出了一种专为视频抠图设计的后训练量化（PTQ）框架PTQ4VM，通过两阶段策略、全局仿射校准和光流辅助组件，显著提升了量化模型的精度和时序一致性，甚至在4位量化下接近全精度性能。", "motivation": "视频抠图在资源受限设备上部署时面临计算密集和量化后精度下降的挑战，现有PTQ方法在视频抠图中尚未系统探索。", "method": "提出两阶段PTQ策略（块重建优化和全局校准）、统计驱动的全局仿射校准（GAC）和光流辅助（OFA）组件。", "result": "PTQ4VM在不同位宽下均达到最优精度，4位量化下性能接近全精度模型，计算量减少8倍。", "conclusion": "PTQ4VM为视频抠图量化提供了高效解决方案，显著提升精度和效率，填补了该领域的研究空白。"}}
