Finally, we\nidentify the challenges in LLMs safety evaluation and propose potential\nresearch directions to promote further advancement in this field.

Recent advancements have\nfocused on adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) for mobility analytics.\nHowever, existing methods face two primary limitations: inadequate semantic\nrepresentation of locations (i.e., discrete IDs) and insufficient modeling of\nmobility signals within LLMs (i.e., single templated instruction fine-tuning).\nTo address these issues, we propose QT-Mob, a novel framework that\nsignificantly enhances LLMs for mobility analytics. QT-Mob introduces a\nlocation tokenization module that learns compact, semantically rich tokens to\nrepresent locations, preserving contextual information while ensuring\ncompatibility with LLMs. Furthermore, QT-Mob incorporates a series of\ncomplementary fine-tuning objectives that align the learned tokens with the\ninternal representations in LLMs, improving the model's comprehension of\nsequential movement patterns and location semantics. The proposed QT-Mob\nframework not only enhances LLMs' ability to interpret mobility data but also\nprovides a more generalizable approach for various mobility analytics tasks.\nExperiments on three real-world dataset demonstrate the superior performance in\nboth next-location prediction and mobility recovery tasks, outperforming\nexisting deep learning and LLM-based methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "QT-Mob框架通过语义丰富的位置标记化和多目标微调，显著提升了LLM在移动数据分析中的性能。", "motivation": "现有方法在位置语义表示和移动信号建模方面存在不足，限制了LLM在移动数据分析中的应用。", "method": "QT-Mob引入位置标记化模块学习语义丰富的标记，并结合多目标微调优化LLM对移动模式和位置语义的理解。", "result": "在三个真实数据集上，QT-Mob在下一位置预测和移动恢复任务中表现优于现有方法。", "conclusion": "QT-Mob不仅提升了LLM对移动数据的解释能力，还为移动分析任务提供了更通用的解决方案。"}}

Moreover, due to the unique perspective of\nUAVs and the interference from adverse conditions, these methods often fail to\naccurately align features and are influenced by limited or noisy pseudo-labels.\nTo address this, we propose the first benchmark for UAV object detection in\nadverse scenes, the Statistical Feedback-Driven Threshold and Mask Adjustment\nTeacher-Student Framework (SF-TMAT).

In this work,\nwe propose ADAMIX, an effective adaptive mixed-precision delta-compression\nframework. We provide a mathematical derivation of quantization error to\nmotivate our mixed-precision compression strategy and formulate the optimal\nmixed-precision bit allocation scheme as the solution to a 0/1 integer linear\nprogramming problem. Our derived bit allocation strategy minimizes the\nquantization error while adhering to a predefined compression ratio\nrequirement. Experimental results on various models and benchmarks demonstrate\nthat our approach surpasses the best baseline by a considerable margin. On\ntasks like AIME2024 and GQA, where the norm of $\\Delta \\mathbf{W}$ is large and\nthe base model lacks sufficient ability, ADAMIX outperforms the best baseline\nDelta-CoMe by 22.3% and 6.1% with 7B models, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "ADAMIX提出了一种自适应混合精度delta压缩框架，通过数学推导优化量化误差，显著提升了压缩性能。", "motivation": "在多租户场景中，大量基于同一基础模型的定制化LLM需要高效压缩，现有方法在高压缩比下性能不足或依赖经验性位分配。", "method": "通过数学推导量化误差，提出混合精度压缩策略，并将最优位分配问题建模为0/1整数线性规划问题。", "result": "在AIME2024和GQA任务上，ADAMIX分别比最佳基线Delta-CoMe提升了22.3%和6.1%。", "conclusion": "ADAMIX在保持高压缩比的同时显著提升了性能，为LLM的delta压缩提供了有效解决方案。"}}

Model quantization, particularly to low\nbit-widths like 4-bit, aims to alleviate this difficulty, yet existing\nPost-Training Quantization (PTQ) and Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) methods\nexhibit significant limitations. PTQ often incurs substantial accuracy drop,\nwhile QAT achieves high accuracy but suffers from prohibitive computational\ncosts, limited generalization to downstream tasks, training instability, and\nlacking of open-source codebase. To address these challenges, this paper\nintroduces General, Practical, and Lightning Quantization (GPLQ), a novel\nframework designed for efficient and effective ViT quantization. GPLQ is\nfounded on two key empirical insights: the paramount importance of activation\nquantization and the necessity of preserving the model's original optimization\n``basin'' to maintain generalization. Consequently, GPLQ employs a sequential\n``activation-first, weights-later'' strategy. Stage 1 keeps weights in FP32\nwhile quantizing activations with a feature mimicking loss in only 1 epoch to\nkeep it stay in the same ``basin'', thereby preserving generalization. Stage 2\nquantizes weights using a PTQ method. As a result, GPLQ is 100x faster than\nexisting QAT methods, lowers memory footprint to levels even below FP32\ntraining, and achieves 4-bit model performance that is highly competitive with\nFP32 models in terms of both accuracy on ImageNet and generalization to diverse\ndownstream tasks, including fine-grained visual classification and object\ndetection.
