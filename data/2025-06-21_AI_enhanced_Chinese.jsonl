They also require human grounding in multi-modal environments,\nwhich can be ad-hoc, rigid, and brittle. Neural networks are good at extracting\nrich contextual information from multi-modal data, but lack interpretable\nstructures for reasoning.\n  Objectives: CALM aims to bridge the gap between logic and neural perception,\ncreating an analog logic that can reason over multi-modal inputs. Without this\nintegration, AI systems remain either brittle or unstructured, unable to\ngeneralize robustly to real-world tasks. In CALM, symbolic predicates evaluate\nto analog truth values computed by neural networks and constrained search.\n  Methods: CALM represents each predicate using a domain tree, which\niteratively refines its analog truth value when the contextual groundings of\nits entities are determined. The iterative refinement is predicted by neural\nnetworks capable of capturing multi-modal information and is filtered through a\nsymbolic reasoning module to ensure constraint satisfaction.\n  Results: In fill-in-the-blank object placement tasks, CALM achieved 92.2%\naccuracy, outperforming classical logic (86.3%) and LLM (59.4%) baselines.

Our particle-grid model captures global shape and motion\ninformation while predicting dense particle movements, enabling the modeling of\nobjects with varied shapes and materials. Particles represent object shapes,\nwhile the spatial grid discretizes the 3D space to ensure spatial continuity\nand enhance learning efficiency. Coupled with Gaussian Splattings for visual\nrendering, our framework achieves a fully learning-based digital twin of\ndeformable objects and generates 3D action-conditioned videos. Through\nexperiments, we demonstrate that our model learns the dynamics of diverse\nobjects -- such as ropes, cloths, stuffed animals, and paper bags -- from\nsparse-view RGB-D recordings of robot-object interactions, while also\ngeneralizing at the category level to unseen instances. Our approach\noutperforms state-of-the-art learning-based and physics-based simulators,\nparticularly in scenarios with limited camera views. Furthermore, we showcase\nthe utility of our learned models in model-based planning, enabling\ngoal-conditioned object manipulation across a range of tasks.

In this\nwork, we propose DAILOC, a novel domain-incremental learning framework that\njointly addresses both temporal and device-induced domain shifts. DAILOC\nintroduces a novel disentanglement strategy that separates domain shifts from\nlocation-relevant features using a multi-level variational autoencoder.\nAdditionally, we introduce a novel memory-guided class latent alignment\nmechanism to address the effects of catastrophic forgetting over time.\nExperiments across multiple smartphones, buildings, and time instances\ndemonstrate that DAILOC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods,\nachieving up to 2.74x lower average error and 4.6x lower worst-case error.", "AI": {"tldr": "DAILOC是一种新型域增量学习框架，通过多级变分自编码器分离域偏移与位置特征，并引入记忆引导的潜在对齐机制，显著提升了Wi-Fi指纹室内定位的性能。", "motivation": "Wi-Fi指纹室内定位在设备异构性和环境时变性的域偏移下表现不佳，现有方法独立处理这些问题导致泛化能力差和灾难性遗忘。", "method": "提出DAILOC框架，采用多级变分自编码器分离域偏移与位置特征，并引入记忆引导的潜在对齐机制。", "result": "在多个智能手机、建筑和时间实例的实验中，DAILOC平均误差降低2.74倍，最坏情况误差降低4.6倍。", "conclusion": "DAILOC通过联合处理时变和设备引起的域偏移，显著提升了室内定位的鲁棒性和准确性。"}}
