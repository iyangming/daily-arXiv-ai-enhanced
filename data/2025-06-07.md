### [1] [Zero-Shot Adaptation of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04244)
*Farzad Farhadzadeh,Debasmit Das,Shubhankar Borse,Fatih Porikli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ProLoRA是一种无需额外训练数据即可实现文本到图像扩散模型中参数高效微调零样本适配的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在切换基础模型时需要重新训练，而数据限制常使这一过程困难。ProLoRA旨在克服这一限制。

Method: 通过将源模型的低秩调整（如LoRA）投影到目标模型的权重空间中，利用子空间和零空间相似性，并选择性对齐层。

Result: 在现有文本到图像模型上的评估表明，ProLoRA成功实现了知识迁移，且性能与重新训练相当。

Conclusion: ProLoRA提供了一种无需重新训练的高效适配方法，解决了数据限制下的模型迁移问题。

Abstract: We introduce ProLoRA, enabling zero-shot adaptation of parameter-efficient
fine-tuning in text-to-image diffusion models. ProLoRA transfers pre-trained
low-rank adjustments (e.g., LoRA) from a source to a target model without
additional training data. This overcomes the limitations of traditional methods
that require retraining when switching base models, often challenging due to
data constraints. ProLoRA achieves this via projection of source adjustments
into the target model's weight space, leveraging subspace and null space
similarities and selectively targeting aligned layers. Evaluations on
established text-to-image models demonstrate successful knowledge transfer and
comparable performance without retraining.

### [2] [Contextual Integrity in LLMs via Reasoning and Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04245)
*Guangchen Lan,Huseyin A. Inan,Sahar Abdelnabi,Janardhan Kulkarni,Lukas Wutschitz,Reza Shokri,Christopher G. Brinton,Robert Sim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过显式推理和强化学习框架来确保自主代理在决策时保持上下文完整性的方法，显著减少了不适当的信息披露。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自主代理为用户决策的普及，确保上下文完整性（CI）成为核心问题，即代理在特定任务中应分享何种信息。

Method: 首先通过提示LLMs显式推理CI，随后开发强化学习框架以进一步培养模型的CI推理能力，使用合成数据集进行训练。

Result: 方法显著减少了不适当的信息披露，同时保持任务性能，且改进可迁移至人类标注的CI基准测试。

Conclusion: 通过推理和强化学习框架，可有效提升自主代理的上下文完整性，减少隐私泄露风险。

Abstract: As the era of autonomous agents making decisions on behalf of users unfolds,
ensuring contextual integrity (CI) -- what is the appropriate information to
share while carrying out a certain task -- becomes a central question to the
field. We posit that CI demands a form of reasoning where the agent needs to
reason about the context in which it is operating. To test this, we first
prompt LLMs to reason explicitly about CI when deciding what information to
disclose. We then extend this approach by developing a reinforcement learning
(RL) framework that further instills in models the reasoning necessary to
achieve CI. Using a synthetic, automatically created, dataset of only $\sim700$
examples but with diverse contexts and information disclosure norms, we show
that our method substantially reduces inappropriate information disclosure
while maintaining task performance across multiple model sizes and families.
Importantly, improvements transfer from this synthetic dataset to established
CI benchmarks such as PrivacyLens that has human annotations and evaluates
privacy leakage of AI assistants in actions and tool calls.

### [3] [Language-Guided Multi-Agent Learning in Simulations: A Unified Framework and Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04251)
*Zhengyang Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM-MARL框架将大型语言模型（LLMs）融入多智能体强化学习（MARL），提升模拟游戏环境中的协调、通信和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过结合LLMs和MARL，旨在增强智能体在复杂环境中的协作与泛化能力。

Method: 框架包含Coordinator、Communicator和Memory三个模块，结合PPO训练和语言条件损失。

Result: 在多个游戏环境中表现优于MAPPO和QMIX，尤其在零样本泛化和协调得分上。

Conclusion: 该框架为多智能体系统的设计提供了新思路，尤其在游戏和人类-AI协作领域。

Abstract: This paper introduces LLM-MARL, a unified framework that incorporates large
language models (LLMs) into multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to
enhance coordination, communication, and generalization in simulated game
environments. The framework features three modular components of Coordinator,
Communicator, and Memory, which dynamically generate subgoals, facilitate
symbolic inter-agent messaging, and support episodic recall. Training combines
PPO with a language-conditioned loss and LLM query gating. LLM-MARL is
evaluated in Google Research Football, MAgent Battle, and StarCraft II. Results
show consistent improvements over MAPPO and QMIX in win rate, coordination
score, and zero-shot generalization. Ablation studies demonstrate that subgoal
generation and language-based messaging each contribute significantly to
performance gains. Qualitative analysis reveals emergent behaviors such as role
specialization and communication-driven tactics. By bridging language modeling
and policy learning, this work contributes to the design of intelligent,
cooperative agents in interactive simulations. It offers a path forward for
leveraging LLMs in multi-agent systems used for training, games, and human-AI
collaboration.

### [4] [A Graph-Retrieval-Augmented Generation Framework Enhances Decision-Making in the Circular Economy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04252)
*Yang Zhao,Chengxiao Dai,Dusit Niyato,Chuan Fu Tan,Keyi Xiang,Yueyang Wang,Zhiquan Yeo,Daren Tan Zong Loong,Jonathan Low Zhaozhi,Eugene H. Z. HO*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CircuGraphRAG结合知识图谱提升LLMs在循环经济中的准确性，显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在可持续制造中因幻觉工业代码和排放因子而影响决策的问题。

Method: 提出CircuGraphRAG框架，通过知识图谱和SPARQL查询实现结构化多跳推理。

Result: 在问答任务中表现优异（ROUGE-L F1达1.0），效率提升（响应时间减半，token使用减少16%）。

Conclusion: CircuGraphRAG为循环经济规划提供可靠支持，推动低碳资源决策。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold promise for sustainable manufacturing, but
often hallucinate industrial codes and emission factors, undermining regulatory
and investment decisions. We introduce CircuGraphRAG, a retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) framework that grounds LLMs outputs in a domain-specific
knowledge graph for the circular economy. This graph connects 117,380
industrial and waste entities with classification codes and GWP100 emission
data, enabling structured multi-hop reasoning. Natural language queries are
translated into SPARQL and verified subgraphs are retrieved to ensure accuracy
and traceability. Compared with Standalone LLMs and Naive RAG, CircuGraphRAG
achieves superior performance in single-hop and multi-hop question answering,
with ROUGE-L F1 scores up to 1.0, while baseline scores below 0.08. It also
improves efficiency, halving the response time and reducing token usage by 16%
in representative tasks. CircuGraphRAG provides fact-checked, regulatory-ready
support for circular economy planning, advancing reliable, low-carbon resource
decision making.

### [5] [HADA: Human-AI Agent Decision Alignment Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04253)
*Tapio Pitkäranta,Leena Pitkäranta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HADA是一个协议和框架无关的参考架构，用于确保LLM代理和传统算法与组织目标和价值观对齐。它通过角色特定的利益相关者代理（如业务、数据科学、审计等）提供对话式API，支持技术与非技术参与者查询、调整、审计或质疑决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型（LLM）代理和传统算法在组织目标和价值观对齐上的挑战，确保决策的透明性、可审计性和伦理合规性。

Method: HADA通过角色特定的利益相关者代理（如业务、数据科学、审计等）包装算法或LLM，提供对话式API，支持自然语言表达对齐目标、KPI和约束条件，并在多代理系统中持续传播和记录。

Result: 在零售银行场景的五个脚本化测试中，HADA实现了六个预定义目标的完全覆盖，包括角色对话控制、KPI追踪、偏见检测与缓解以及决策溯源。

Conclusion: HADA为多代理系统中的人机对齐提供了开源架构和中层设计理论，实证表明其能提升决策管线的准确性、透明性和伦理合规性。

Abstract: We present HADA (Human-AI Agent Decision Alignment), a protocol- and
framework agnostic reference architecture that keeps both large language model
(LLM) agents and legacy algorithms aligned with organizational targets and
values. HADA wraps any algorithm or LLM in role-specific stakeholder agents --
business, data-science, audit, ethics, and customer -- each exposing
conversational APIs so that technical and non-technical actors can query,
steer, audit, or contest every decision across strategic, tactical, and
real-time horizons. Alignment objectives, KPIs, and value constraints are
expressed in natural language and are continuously propagated, logged, and
versioned while thousands of heterogeneous agents run on different
orchestration stacks. A cloud-native proof of concept packages a production
credit-scoring model (getLoanDecision) and deploys it on
Docker/Kubernetes/Python; five scripted retail-bank scenarios show how target
changes, parameter tweaks, explanation requests, and ethics triggers flow end
to end through the architecture. Evaluation followed the Design-Science
Research Methodology. Walkthrough observation and log inspection demonstrated
complete coverage of six predefined objectives: every role could invoke
conversational control, trace KPIs and value constraints, detect and mitigate
ZIP-code bias, and reproduce full decision lineage, independent of the
underlying LLM or agent library. Contributions: (1) an open-source HADA
architecture, (2) a mid-range design theory for human-AI alignment in
multi-agent systems, and (3) empirical evidence that framework-agnostic,
protocol-compliant stakeholder agents improve accuracy, transparency, and
ethical compliance in real-world decision pipelines.

### [6] [Automated Skill Discovery for Language Agents through Exploration and Iterative Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04287)
*Yongjin Yang,Sinjae Kang,Juyong Lee,Dongjun Lee,Se-Young Yun,Kimin Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EXIF框架通过探索优先策略和反馈循环，自动发现LLM代理的有意义技能，无需人工干预即可提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练LLM代理以获取技能和执行多样化任务面临数据集生成的挑战，如人工成本高和LLM提议任务不可行。

Method: 采用探索代理（Alice）生成可行技能数据集，通过反馈循环迭代训练目标代理（Bob）。

Result: 在Webshop和Crafter实验中，EXIF显著提升代理性能，且同模型Alice和Bob设置进一步优化效果。

Conclusion: EXIF展示了构建自进化系统的潜力，能有效扩展代理能力。

Abstract: Training large language model (LLM) agents to acquire necessary skills and
perform diverse tasks within an environment is gaining interest as a means to
enable open-endedness. However, creating the training dataset for their skill
acquisition faces several challenges. Manual trajectory collection requires
significant human effort. Another approach, where LLMs directly propose tasks
to learn, is often invalid, as the LLMs lack knowledge of which tasks are
actually feasible. Moreover, the generated data may not provide a meaningful
learning signal, as agents often already perform well on the proposed tasks. To
address this, we propose a novel automatic skill discovery framework EXIF for
LLM-powered agents, designed to improve the feasibility of generated target
behaviors while accounting for the agents' capabilities. Our method adopts an
exploration-first strategy by employing an exploration agent (Alice) to train
the target agent (Bob) to learn essential skills in the environment.
Specifically, Alice first interacts with the environment to retrospectively
generate a feasible, environment-grounded skill dataset, which is then used to
train Bob. Crucially, we incorporate an iterative feedback loop, where Alice
evaluates Bob's performance to identify areas for improvement. This feedback
then guides Alice's next round of exploration, forming a closed-loop data
generation process. Experiments on Webshop and Crafter demonstrate EXIF's
ability to effectively discover meaningful skills and iteratively expand the
capabilities of the trained agent without any human intervention, achieving
substantial performance improvements. Interestingly, we observe that setting
Alice to the same model as Bob also notably improves performance, demonstrating
EXIF's potential for building a self-evolving system.

### [7] [A Statistical Physics of Language Model Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04374)
*Jack David Carson,Amir Reisizadeh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种统计物理框架，用于分析Transformer语言模型的连续时间推理动态，通过低维流形上的随机动力学系统建模推理过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer语言模型展现出难以用机制解释的推理能力，因此需要一种新的理论框架来理解其推理动态。

Method: 采用统计物理方法，将推理过程建模为低维流形上的随机动力学系统，并结合潜在状态切换机制捕捉推理阶段。

Result: 实验表明，低维投影能解释约50%的方差，并识别出四种潜在推理状态。提出的SLDS模型成功验证了这些特征。

Conclusion: 该框架为低成本模拟推理过程提供了工具，有助于研究和预测语言模型的关键状态转换（如推理失败）。

Abstract: Transformer LMs show emergent reasoning that resists mechanistic
understanding. We offer a statistical physics framework for continuous-time
chain-of-thought reasoning dynamics. We model sentence-level hidden state
trajectories as a stochastic dynamical system on a lower-dimensional manifold.
This drift-diffusion system uses latent regime switching to capture diverse
reasoning phases, including misaligned states or failures. Empirical
trajectories (8 models, 7 benchmarks) show a rank-40 projection (balancing
variance capture and feasibility) explains ~50% variance. We find four latent
reasoning regimes. An SLDS model is formulated and validated to capture these
features. The framework enables low-cost reasoning simulation, offering tools
to study and predict critical transitions like misaligned states or other LM
failures.

### [8] [Matter-of-Fact: A Benchmark for Verifying the Feasibility of Literature-Supported Claims in Materials Science](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04410)
*Peter Jansen,Samiah Hassan,Ruoyao Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出Matter-of-Fact数据集，用于评估假设（以科学主张形式）的可行性，旨在优化科学发现系统的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化实验成本高，需筛选可行假设以提高发现效率。

Method: 构建包含8.4k科学主张的数据集，覆盖材料科学多个领域，测试现有模型性能。

Result: 现有模型（如检索增强生成和代码生成）表现不佳（最高72%准确率），但专家认为问题可解。

Conclusion: 任务对当前模型具挑战性，但解决后可显著加速科学发现。

Abstract: Contemporary approaches to assisted scientific discovery use language models
to automatically generate large numbers of potential hypothesis to test, while
also automatically generating code-based experiments to test those hypotheses.
While hypotheses can be comparatively inexpensive to generate, automated
experiments can be costly, particularly when run at scale (i.e. thousands of
experiments). Developing the capacity to filter hypotheses based on their
feasibility would allow discovery systems to run at scale, while increasing
their likelihood of making significant discoveries. In this work we introduce
Matter-of-Fact, a challenge dataset for determining the feasibility of
hypotheses framed as claims. Matter-of-Fact includes 8.4k claims extracted from
scientific articles spanning four high-impact contemporary materials science
topics, including superconductors, semiconductors, batteries, and aerospace
materials, while including qualitative and quantitative claims from
theoretical, experimental, and code/simulation results. We show that strong
baselines that include retrieval augmented generation over scientific
literature and code generation fail to exceed 72% performance on this task
(chance performance is 50%), while domain-expert verification suggests nearly
all are solvable -- highlighting both the difficulty of this task for current
models, and the potential to accelerate scientific discovery by making
near-term progress.

*Xixi Wang,Miguel Costa,Jordanka Kovaceva,Shuai Wang,Francisco C. Pereira*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图的框架，利用人工整理的关系知识解决多表问答中的模式链接问题，显著提升了复杂工业表格数据的处理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于语义相似度的方法在处理复杂多表问答时表现不佳，尤其是在真实工业场景中。

Method: 采用图结构编码模式链接和连接路径，结合剪枝和子路径合并策略，构建可解释的推理链。

Result: 在标准基准和真实大规模数据集上验证了方法的有效性，首次应用于复杂工业表格数据。

Conclusion: 该方法在多表问答中表现出色，为复杂工业数据提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in table Question Answering
(Table QA). However, extending these capabilities to multi-table QA remains
challenging due to unreliable schema linking across complex tables. Existing
methods based on semantic similarity work well only on simplified hand-crafted
datasets and struggle to handle complex, real-world scenarios with numerous and
diverse columns. To address this, we propose a graph-based framework that
leverages human-curated relational knowledge to explicitly encode schema links
and join paths. Given a natural language query, our method searches this graph
to construct interpretable reasoning chains, aided by pruning and sub-path
merging strategies to enhance efficiency and coherence. Experiments on both
standard benchmarks and a realistic, large-scale dataset demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach. To our knowledge, this is the first multi-table
QA system applied to truly complex industrial tabular data.

### [10] [An AI-Based Public Health Data Monitoring System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04429)
*Ananya Joshi,Nolan Gormley,Richa Gadgil,Tina Townes,Roni Rosenfeld,Bryan Wilder*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于排名和AI异常检测的公共卫生数据监控新方法，显著提升了效率和效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统警报监控系统难以应对现代公共卫生数据监控的需求，如阈值频繁调整和数据量大导致的延迟。

Method: 采用基于排名和AI异常检测的新监控范式，通过多年跨学科合作开发并部署。

Result: 系统每天可监控500万数据点，三个月评估显示审核速度效率提升54倍。

Conclusion: 人本AI有潜力革新公共卫生决策。

Abstract: Public health experts need scalable approaches to monitor large volumes of
health data (e.g., cases, hospitalizations, deaths) for outbreaks or data
quality issues. Traditional alert-based monitoring systems struggle with modern
public health data monitoring systems for several reasons, including that
alerting thresholds need to be constantly reset and the data volumes may cause
application lag. Instead, we propose a ranking-based monitoring paradigm that
leverages new AI anomaly detection methods. Through a multi-year
interdisciplinary collaboration, the resulting system has been deployed at a
national organization to monitor up to 5,000,000 data points daily. A
three-month longitudinal deployed evaluation revealed a significant improvement
in monitoring objectives, with a 54x increase in reviewer speed efficiency
compared to traditional alert-based methods. This work highlights the potential
of human-centered AI to transform public health decision-making.

### [11] [Matching Markets Meet LLMs: Algorithmic Reasoning with Ranked Preferences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04478)
*Hadi Hosseini,Samarth Khanna,Ronak Singh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在匹配市场中的表现，发现其在处理排名偏好和结构化算法时存在局限性，尤其是在大型市场中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 匹配市场是资源分配和拼车等应用的核心框架，但LLMs在处理排名偏好和结构化算法方面的能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 评估了多个先进模型在偏好推理任务上的表现，包括稳定匹配生成、不稳定性检测与解决等。

Result: 即使性能最佳的模型在大型市场中仍难以解决不稳定性问题，而参数高效微调（LoRA）仅在小规模市场中表现显著。

Conclusion: 需要更复杂的策略来提升LLMs在处理大规模上下文输入时的推理能力。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven progress in reasoning
tasks -- from program synthesis to scientific hypothesis generation -- yet
their ability to handle ranked preferences and structured algorithms in
combinatorial domains remains underexplored. We study matching markets, a core
framework behind applications like resource allocation and ride-sharing, which
require reconciling individual ranked preferences to ensure stable outcomes. We
evaluate several state-of-the-art models on a hierarchy of preference-based
reasoning tasks -- ranging from stable-matching generation to instability
detection, instability resolution, and fine-grained preference queries -- to
systematically expose their logical and algorithmic limitations in handling
ranked inputs. Surprisingly, even top-performing models with advanced reasoning
struggle to resolve instability in large markets, often failing to identify
blocking pairs or execute algorithms iteratively. We further show that
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA) significantly improves performance in
small markets, but fails to bring about a similar improvement on large
instances, suggesting the need for more sophisticated strategies to improve
LLMs' reasoning with larger-context inputs.

### [12] [CogMath: Assessing LLMs' Authentic Mathematical Ability from a Human Cognitive Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04481)
*Jiayu Liu,Zhenya Huang,Wei Dai,Cheng Cheng,Jinze Wu,Jing Sha,Song Li,Qi Liu,Shijin Wang,Enhong Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CogMath提出了一种基于人类认知的三阶段评估框架，通过9个细粒度维度全面评估LLMs的数学能力，发现主流LLMs的能力被高估30%-40%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法仅依赖答案准确性，无法真实反映LLMs的数学能力，需更细粒度的评估框架。

Method: CogMath将人类推理过程分为问题理解、问题解决和解决方案总结三阶段，设计9个评估维度，并采用多智能体系统生成评估问题。

Result: 应用CogMath发现7种主流LLMs的数学能力被高估30%-40%，并识别了其在各阶段/维度的优缺点。

Conclusion: CogMath为LLMs数学能力的评估提供了更全面的视角，有助于进一步优化其推理能力。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) show promise in solving complex
mathematical tasks, existing evaluation paradigms rely solely on a coarse
measure of overall answer accuracy, which are insufficient for assessing their
authentic capabilities. In this paper, we propose \textbf{CogMath}, which
comprehensively assesses LLMs' mathematical abilities through the lens of human
cognition. Specifically, inspired by psychological theories, CogMath formalizes
human reasoning process into 3 stages: \emph{problem comprehension},
\emph{problem solving}, and \emph{solution summarization}. Within these stages,
we investigate perspectives such as numerical calculation, knowledge, and
counterfactuals, and design a total of 9 fine-grained evaluation dimensions. In
each dimension, we develop an ``\emph{Inquiry}-\emph{Judge}-\emph{Reference}''
multi-agent system to generate inquiries that assess LLMs' mastery from this
dimension. An LLM is considered to truly master a problem only when excelling
in all inquiries from the 9 dimensions. By applying CogMath on three
benchmarks, we reveal that the mathematical capabilities of 7 mainstream LLMs
are overestimated by 30\%-40\%. Moreover, we locate their strengths and
weaknesses across specific stages/dimensions, offering in-depth insights to
further enhance their reasoning abilities.

*Aladin Djuhera,Amin Seffo,Masataro Asai,Holger Boche*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: STPR框架利用大语言模型（LLM）将自然语言约束转化为可执行的Python函数，用于机器人导航规划，避免复杂推理和幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言约束复杂且非正式，难以直接转化为规划算法可用的形式化描述，需要一种高效且准确的翻译方法。

Method: 提出STPR框架，利用LLM的编码能力将约束（如“不要做什么”）转化为Python函数，应用于点云表示和传统搜索算法。

Result: 实验表明，STPR能准确描述复杂数学约束，并在模拟环境中完全遵守约束，同时运行时间短。

Conclusion: STPR不仅适用于大型LLM，还能与小型代码专用LLM结合，具有广泛适用性和低推理成本。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have spurred interest in
robotic navigation that incorporates complex spatial, mathematical, and
conditional constraints from natural language into the planning problem. Such
constraints can be informal yet highly complex, making it challenging to
translate into a formal description that can be passed on to a planning
algorithm. In this paper, we propose STPR, a constraint generation framework
that uses LLMs to translate constraints (expressed as instructions on ``what
not to do'') into executable Python functions. STPR leverages the LLM's strong
coding capabilities to shift the problem description from language into
structured and transparent code, thus circumventing complex reasoning and
avoiding potential hallucinations. We show that these LLM-generated functions
accurately describe even complex mathematical constraints, and apply them to
point cloud representations with traditional search algorithms. Experiments in
a simulated Gazebo environment show that STPR ensures full compliance across
several constraints and scenarios, while having short runtimes. We also verify
that STPR can be used with smaller, code-specific LLMs, making it applicable to
a wide range of compact models at low inference cost.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了利用大型语言模型（LLMs）自动生成语义网和自然语言处理中的数据模式（schemas），以减少对知识工程师和领域专家的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模式创建需要大量人工参与，而LLMs在相关任务（如本体工程）中表现出色，因此研究如何利用LLMs实现自动化模式生成。

Method: 引入YAGO Schema和Wikidata EntitySchema数据集及评估指标，基于LLMs的流程利用知识图谱的局部和全局信息生成Shape Expressions（ShEx）模式。

Result: 实验表明LLMs能生成高质量的ShEx模式，为大规模知识图谱的自动化模式生成提供了可能。

Conclusion: LLMs在模式生成中潜力巨大，同时提出的基准为结构化生成任务设定了新挑战。

Abstract: Schemas are vital for ensuring data quality in the Semantic Web and natural
language processing. Traditionally, their creation demands substantial
involvement from knowledge engineers and domain experts. Leveraging the
impressive capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in related tasks like
ontology engineering, we explore automatic schema generation using LLMs. To
bridge the resource gap, we introduce two datasets: YAGO Schema and Wikidata
EntitySchema, along with evaluation metrics. The LLM-based pipelines
effectively utilize local and global information from knowledge graphs (KGs) to
generate validating schemas in Shape Expressions (ShEx). Experiments
demonstrate LLMs' strong potential in producing high-quality ShEx schemas,
paving the way for scalable, automated schema generation for large KGs.
Furthermore, our benchmark introduces a new challenge for structured
generation, pushing the limits of LLMs on syntactically rich formalisms.

TL;DR: OpenAg是一个农业人工智能框架，结合领域特定知识、多智能体推理和因果解释性，为小农户提供可操作的建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前农业智能系统缺乏上下文理解、可解释性和适应性的问题，尤其是针对资源有限的小农户。

Method: 结合领域特定的基础模型、神经知识图谱、多智能体推理、因果解释性和自适应迁移学习。

Result: 开发了OpenAg框架，包括统一农业知识库、神经知识图谱、多智能体推理系统和因果透明机制。

Conclusion: OpenAg旨在弥合科学知识与农民经验之间的差距，支持可扩展且本地相关的农业决策。

Abstract: Agriculture is undergoing a major transformation driven by artificial
intelligence (AI), machine learning, and knowledge representation technologies.
However, current agricultural intelligence systems often lack contextual
understanding, explainability, and adaptability, especially for smallholder
farmers with limited resources. General-purpose large language models (LLMs),
while powerful, typically lack the domain-specific knowledge and contextual
reasoning needed for practical decision support in farming. They tend to
produce recommendations that are too generic or unrealistic for real-world
applications. To address these challenges, we present OpenAg, a comprehensive
framework designed to advance agricultural artificial general intelligence
(AGI). OpenAg combines domain-specific foundation models, neural knowledge
graphs, multi-agent reasoning, causal explainability, and adaptive transfer
learning to deliver context-aware, explainable, and actionable insights. The
system includes: (i) a unified agricultural knowledge base that integrates
scientific literature, sensor data, and farmer-generated knowledge; (ii) a
neural agricultural knowledge graph for structured reasoning and inference;

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeePoly框架通过结合深度神经网络（DNN）和多项式基函数，解决了传统DNN方法在求解偏微分方程（PDE）时缺乏收敛保证和计算效率的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DNN方法在求解PDE时存在收敛性和效率的不足，DeePoly旨在通过两阶段方法弥补这些缺陷。

Method: DeePoly采用两阶段方法：先用DNN捕捉全局特征，再用线性空间优化结合DNN特征和多项式基函数。

Result: 理论分析和实验表明，该方法显著提高了精度和效率，同时保持无网格和无格式特性。

Conclusion: DeePoly为PDE求解提供了一种高效且理论可靠的新方法，并作为开源项目发布。

Abstract: Recently, machine learning methods have gained significant traction in
scientific computing, particularly for solving Partial Differential Equations
(PDEs). However, methods based on deep neural networks (DNNs) often lack
convergence guarantees and computational efficiency compared to traditional
numerical schemes. This work introduces DeePoly, a novel framework that
transforms the solution paradigm from pure non-convex parameter optimization to
a two-stage approach: first employing a DNN to capture complex global features,
followed by linear space optimization with combined DNN-extracted features
(Scoper) and polynomial basis functions (Sniper). This strategic combination
leverages the complementary strengths of both methods -- DNNs excel at
approximating complex global features (i.e., high-gradient features) and
stabilize the polynomial approximation while polynomial bases provide
high-precision local corrections with convergence guarantees. Theoretical
analysis and numerical experiments demonstrate that this approach significantly
enhances both high-order accuracy and efficiency across diverse problem types
while maintaining mesh-free and scheme-free properties. This paper also serves
as a theoretical exposition for the open-source project DeePoly.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种用于GUI自动化的预操作批评机制（GUI-Critic-R1），通过S-GRPO策略增强反馈可靠性，并开发了数据收集管道填补数据空白。实验表明该模型在准确性和自动化效率上优于现有MLLMs。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GUI自动化任务需要实时决策且容错率低，现有方法易因错误累积导致不可逆后果，因此需一种预操作反馈机制提升可靠性。

Method: 提出S-GRPO策略构建GUI-Critic-R1模型，引入建议奖励优化反馈；开发基于推理引导的数据收集管道生成训练和测试数据集。

Result: 静态实验显示GUI-Critic-R1在移动和网页领域批评准确率显著优于现有MLLMs；动态评估表明其提升了自动化成功率和效率。

Conclusion: GUI-Critic-R1通过预操作批评机制有效提升了GUI自动化任务的可靠性和性能，填补了数据和方法上的空白。

Abstract: In recent years, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have been
extensively utilized for multimodal reasoning tasks, including Graphical User
Interface (GUI) automation. Unlike general offline multimodal tasks, GUI
automation is executed in online interactive environments, necessitating
step-by-step decision-making based on real-time status of the environment. This
task has a lower tolerance for decision-making errors at each step, as any
mistakes may cumulatively disrupt the process and potentially lead to
irreversible outcomes like deletions or payments. To address these issues, we
introduce a pre-operative critic mechanism that provides effective feedback
prior to the actual execution, by reasoning about the potential outcome and
correctness of actions. Specifically, we propose a Suggestion-aware Gradient
Relative Policy Optimization (S-GRPO) strategy to construct our pre-operative
critic model GUI-Critic-R1, incorporating a novel suggestion reward to enhance
the reliability of the model's feedback. Furthermore, we develop a
reasoning-bootstrapping based data collection pipeline to create a
GUI-Critic-Train and a GUI-Critic-Test, filling existing gaps in GUI critic
data. Static experiments on the GUI-Critic-Test across both mobile and web
domains reveal that our GUI-Critic-R1 offers significant advantages in critic
accuracy compared to current MLLMs. Dynamic evaluation on GUI automation
benchmark further highlights the effectiveness and superiority of our model, as
evidenced by improved success rates and operational efficiency.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文介绍了一个针对法律推理任务的新基准CHANCERY，专注于公司治理章程中的行为一致性判断，评估模型的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有法律数据集未专门针对推理任务，而推理是法律实践的核心。因此，作者提出了一个公司治理推理基准，填补这一空白。

Method: 基于24条公司治理原则和79份真实公司章程，构建了CHANCERY基准，要求模型对行为与章程一致性进行二元分类。

Result: SOTA模型（如Claude 3.7 Sonnet和GPT-4o）准确率分别为64.5%和75.2%，推理代理（如ReAct和CodeAct）表现更优，达76.1%和78.1%。

Conclusion: CHANCERY基准揭示了SOTA模型在法律推理上的局限性，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Law has long been a domain that has been popular in natural language
processing (NLP) applications. Reasoning (ratiocination and the ability to make
connections to precedent) is a core part of the practice of the law in the real
world. Nevertheless, while multiple legal datasets exist, none have thus far
focused specifically on reasoning tasks. We focus on a specific aspect of the
legal landscape by introducing a corporate governance reasoning benchmark
(CHANCERY) to test a model's ability to reason about whether
executive/board/shareholder's proposed actions are consistent with corporate
governance charters. This benchmark introduces a first-of-its-kind corporate
governance reasoning test for language models - modeled after real world
corporate governance law. The benchmark consists of a corporate charter (a set
of governing covenants) and a proposal for executive action. The model's task
is one of binary classification: reason about whether the action is consistent
with the rules contained within the charter. We create the benchmark following
established principles of corporate governance - 24 concrete corporate
governance principles established in and 79 real life corporate charters
selected to represent diverse industries from a total dataset of 10k real life
corporate charters. Evaluations on state-of-the-art (SOTA) reasoning models
confirm the difficulty of the benchmark, with models such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet
and GPT-4o achieving 64.5% and 75.2% accuracy respectively. Reasoning agents
exhibit superior performance, with agents based on the ReAct and CodeAct
frameworks scoring 76.1% and 78.1% respectively, further confirming the
advanced legal reasoning capabilities required to score highly on the
benchmark. We also conduct an analysis of the types of questions which current
reasoning models struggle on, revealing insights into the legal reasoning
capabilities of SOTA models.

Motivation: 探讨LLM代理能否在挑战性环境中通过自我改进提升战略规划能力。

Method: 使用《卡坦岛》游戏框架，设计多角色协作架构（分析员、研究员、编码员、玩家），比较手动与LLM自进化代理的表现。

Result: 自进化代理（如Claude 3.7和GPT-4o驱动）在策略适应和迭代推理上优于静态代理。

Conclusion: LLM代理能通过自我改进在复杂任务中提升表现，展示了自适应推理的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs have enabled their use as autonomous agents across a
range of tasks, yet they continue to struggle with formulating and adhering to
coherent long-term strategies. In this paper, we investigate whether LLM agents
can self-improve when placed in environments that explicitly challenge their
strategic planning abilities. Using the board game Settlers of Catan, accessed
through the open-source Catanatron framework, we benchmark a progression of
LLM-based agents, from a simple game-playing agent to systems capable of
autonomously rewriting their own prompts and their player agent's code. We
introduce a multi-agent architecture in which specialized roles (Analyzer,
Researcher, Coder, and Player) collaborate to iteratively analyze gameplay,
research new strategies, and modify the agent's logic or prompt. By comparing
manually crafted agents to those evolved entirely by LLMs, we evaluate how
effectively these systems can diagnose failure and adapt over time. Our results
show that self-evolving agents, particularly when powered by models like Claude
3.7 and GPT-4o, outperform static baselines by autonomously adopting their
strategies, passing along sample behavior to game-playing agents, and
demonstrating adaptive reasoning over multiple iterations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）的框架（E-bike agents），用于从非结构化的电动自行车事故报告中分类和提取安全变量，并通过有序逻辑模型分析事故严重性与因素（如性别、原因类型和环境条件）的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电动自行车（e-bike）使用量激增导致事故频发，但事故报告多为非结构化叙述，难以进行定量安全分析。

Method: 研究设计了四个LLM代理，分别处理数据分类、信息提取、伤害原因确定和部件关联，提取可能导致事故的关键因素，并使用有序逻辑模型分析事故严重性与因素的关系。

Result: 研究发现设备问题比人为问题稍多，但人为事故更致命；踏板、轮胎和刹车是常见事故原因。模型分类准确率加权F1得分为0.87。

Conclusion: 该方法为电动自行车安全分析提供了可扩展的解决方案，并为政策制定者、设计师和监管机构提供了实用信息。

Abstract: Electric bicycles (e-bikes) are rapidly increasing in use, raising safety
concerns due to a rise in accident reports. However, e-bike incident reports
often use unstructured narrative formats, which hinders quantitative safety
analysis. This study introduces E-bike agents, a framework that uses large
language models (LLM) powered agents to classify and extract safety variables
from unstructured incident reports. Our framework consists of four LLM agents,
handling data classification, information extraction, injury cause
determination, and component linkage, to extract the key factors that could
lead to E-bike accidents and cause varying severity levels. Furthermore, we
used an ordered logit model to examine the relationship between the severity of
the incident and the factors retrieved, such as gender, the type of cause, and
environmental conditions. Our research shows that equipment issues are slightly
more common than human-related ones, but human-related incidents are more often
fatal. Specifically, pedals, tires, and brakes are frequent contributors to
accidents. The model achieves a high weighted F1 score of 0.87 in
classification accuracy, highlighting the potential of using LLMs to extract
unstructured data in niche domains, such as transportation. Our method offers a
scalable solution to improve e-bike safety analytics and provides actionable
information for policy makers, designers, and regulators.

Conclusion: LLM驱动的代理为MMO经济模拟提供了一种更接近人类行为的新方法，解决了现有技术的不足。

Abstract: Within the domain of Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) economy research,
Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) has emerged as a robust tool for analyzing game
economics, evolving from rule-based agents to decision-making agents enhanced
by reinforcement learning. Nevertheless, existing works encounter significant
challenges when attempting to emulate human-like economic activities among
agents, particularly regarding agent reliability, sociability, and
interpretability. In this study, we take a preliminary step in introducing a
novel approach using Large Language Models (LLMs) in MMO economy simulation.
Leveraging LLMs' role-playing proficiency, generative capacity, and reasoning
aptitude, we design LLM-driven agents with human-like decision-making and
adaptability. These agents are equipped with the abilities of role-playing,
perception, memory, and reasoning, addressing the aforementioned challenges
effectively. Simulation experiments focusing on in-game economic activities
demonstrate that LLM-empowered agents can promote emergent phenomena like role
specialization and price fluctuations in line with market rules.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个细粒度的分析框架，研究强化学习（RL）对语言模型推理能力的影响，重点关注计划执行、问题分解和知识利用等方面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管RL训练方法（如GRPO）在语言模型中表现出显著的性能提升，但其优势的具体机制尚不明确。为了填补这一空白，作者开发了一个分析框架。

Method: 通过框架分析RL对推理的三个关键要素的影响：计划执行、问题分解和知识利用，并比较RL调优模型与基础模型的性能差异。

Result: 研究发现，RL调优模型在计划执行上表现更稳健，且能更好地整合外部知识，但在某些情况下，提供明确计划反而会降低性能。

Conclusion: RL可能主要通过帮助模型制定内部策略而非执行外部计划来提升推理能力，为推理模型的训练和评估提供了更系统的基础。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become the dominant paradigm for endowing
language models with advanced reasoning capabilities. Despite the substantial
empirical gains demonstrated by RL-based training methods like GRPO, a granular
understanding of their advantages is still lacking. To address this gap, we
introduce a fine-grained analytic framework to dissect the impact of RL on
reasoning. Our framework specifically investigates key elements that have been
hypothesized to benefit from RL training: (1) plan-following and execution, (2)
problem decomposition, and (3) improved reasoning and knowledge utilization.
Using this framework, we gain insights beyond mere accuracy. For instance,
providing models with explicit step-by-step plans surprisingly degrades
performance on the most challenging benchmarks, yet RL-tuned models exhibit
greater robustness, experiencing markedly smaller performance drops than their
base counterparts. This suggests that RL may not primarily enhance the
execution of external plans but rather empower models to formulate and follow
internal strategies better suited to their reasoning processes. Conversely, we
observe that RL enhances the model's capacity to integrate provided knowledge
into its reasoning process, leading to performance improvements across diverse
tasks. We also study difficulty, showing improved training by developing new
ways to exploit hard problems. Our findings lay a foundation for more
principled training and evaluation of reasoning models.

Result: 评估结果波动显著，性能改进难以可靠复现。

Conclusion: 需要更严格的模型性能评估范式以确保结果的可信度。

Abstract: Reasoning models represented by the Deepseek-R1-Distill series have been
widely adopted by the open-source community due to their strong performance in
mathematics, science, programming, and other domains. However, our study
reveals that their benchmark evaluation results are subject to significant
fluctuations caused by various factors. Subtle differences in evaluation
conditions can lead to substantial variations in results. Similar phenomena are
observed in other open-source inference models fine-tuned based on the
Deepseek-R1-Distill series, as well as in the QwQ-32B model, making their
claimed performance improvements difficult to reproduce reliably. Therefore, we
advocate for the establishment of a more rigorous paradigm for model
performance evaluation and present our empirical assessments of the
Deepseek-R1-Distill series models.

Abstract: Medical artificial intelligence (AI) systems frequently lack systematic
domain expertise integration, potentially compromising diagnostic reliability.
This study presents an ontology-based framework for bone disease diagnosis,
developed in collaboration with Ho Chi Minh City Hospital for Traumatology and
Orthopedics. The framework introduces three theoretical contributions: (1) a
hierarchical neural network architecture guided by bone disease ontology for
segmentation-classification tasks, incorporating Visual Language Models (VLMs)
through prompts, (2) an ontology-enhanced Visual Question Answering (VQA)
system for clinical reasoning, and (3) a multimodal deep learning model that
integrates imaging, clinical, and laboratory data through ontological
relationships. The methodology maintains clinical interpretability through
systematic knowledge digitization, standardized medical terminology mapping,
and modular architecture design. The framework demonstrates potential for
extension beyond bone diseases through its standardized structure and reusable
components. While theoretical foundations are established, experimental
validation remains pending due to current dataset and computational resource
limitations. Future work will focus on expanding the clinical dataset and
conducting comprehensive system validation.

Result: 实验显示，该方法在安全关键连续控制任务中显著优于非自适应方法，同时优化安全性与性能。

Conclusion: 所提框架在安全与性能上均表现优异，适用于多样化安全关键任务。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) applications in real-world scenarios must
prioritize safety and reliability, which impose strict constraints on agent
behavior. Model-based RL leverages predictive world models for action planning
and policy optimization, but inherent model inaccuracies can lead to
catastrophic failures in safety-critical settings. We propose a novel
model-based RL framework that jointly optimizes task performance and safety. To
address world model errors, our method incorporates an adaptive mechanism that
dynamically switches between model-based planning and direct policy execution.
We resolve the objective mismatch problem of traditional model-based approaches
using an implicit world model. Furthermore, our framework employs dynamic
safety thresholds that adapt to the agent's evolving capabilities, consistently
selecting actions that surpass safe policy suggestions in both performance and
safety. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements over non-adaptive
methods, showing that our approach optimizes safety and performance
simultaneously rather than merely meeting minimum safety requirements. The
proposed framework achieves robust performance on diverse safety-critical
continuous control tasks, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: As cyber-attacks show to be more and more complex and coordinated,
cyber-defenders strategy through multi-agent approaches could be key to tackle
against cyber-attacks as close as entry points in a networked system. This
paper presents a Markovian modeling and implementation through a simulator of
fighting cyber-attacker agents and cyber-defender agents deployed on host
network nodes. It aims to provide an experimental framework to implement
realistically based coordinated cyber-attack scenarios while assessing
cyber-defenders dynamic organizations. We abstracted network nodes by sets of
properties including agents' ones. Actions applied by agents model how the
network reacts depending in a given state and what properties are to change.
Collective choice of the actions brings the whole environment closer or farther
from respective cyber-attackers and cyber-defenders goals. Using the simulator,
we implemented a realistically inspired scenario with several behavior
implementation approaches for cyber-defenders and cyber-attackers.

Method: LLMs根据文本描述生成初始控制策略，并通过性能反馈和感知运动数据迭代优化。

Result: 在Gymnasium和MuJoCo库的经典控制任务中验证，多数情况下能识别最优或高性能解决方案。

Conclusion: 该方法成功整合符号推理与感知运动数据，为具身代理控制提供新思路。

Abstract: We propose a method that enables large language models (LLMs) to control
embodied agents by directly mapping continuous observation vectors to
continuous action vectors. Initially, the LLMs generate a control strategy
based on a textual description of the agent, its environment, and the intended
goal. This strategy is then iteratively refined through a learning process in
which the LLMs are repeatedly prompted to improve the current strategy, using
performance feedback and sensory-motor data collected during its evaluation.
The method is validated on classic control tasks from the Gymnasium library and
the inverted pendulum task from the MuJoCo library. In most cases, it
successfully identifies optimal or high-performing solutions by integrating
symbolic knowledge derived through reasoning with sub-symbolic sensory-motor
data gathered as the agent interacts with its environment.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了推理模型特有的诚实问题，为可信AI对齐提供了工具。

Abstract: The honesty of large language models (LLMs) is a critical alignment
challenge, especially as advanced systems with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
may strategically deceive humans. Unlike traditional honesty issues on LLMs,
which could be possibly explained as some kind of hallucination, those models'
explicit thought paths enable us to study strategic deception--goal-driven,
intentional misinformation where reasoning contradicts outputs. Using
representation engineering, we systematically induce, detect, and control such
deception in CoT-enabled LLMs, extracting "deception vectors" via Linear
Artificial Tomography (LAT) for 89% detection accuracy. Through activation
steering, we achieve a 40% success rate in eliciting context-appropriate
deception without explicit prompts, unveiling the specific honesty-related
issue of reasoning models and providing tools for trustworthy AI alignment.

Abstract: This paper introduces Differentiable Logic Cellular Automata (DiffLogic CA),
a novel combination of Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) and Differentiable Logic
Gates Networks (DLGNs). The fundamental computation units of the model are
differentiable logic gates, combined into a circuit. During training, the model
is fully end-to-end differentiable allowing gradient-based training, and at
inference time it operates in a fully discrete state space. This enables
learning local update rules for cellular automata while preserving their
inherent discrete nature. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach
through a series of milestones: (1) fully learning the rules of Conway's Game
of Life, (2) generating checkerboard patterns that exhibit resilience to noise
and damage, (3) growing a lizard shape, and (4) multi-color pattern generation.
Our model successfully learns recurrent circuits capable of generating desired
target patterns. For simpler patterns, we observe success with both synchronous
and asynchronous updates, demonstrating significant generalization capabilities
and robustness to perturbations. We make the case that this combination of
DLGNs and NCA represents a step toward programmable matter and robust computing
systems that combine binary logic, neural network adaptability, and localized
processing. This work, to the best of our knowledge, is the first successful
application of differentiable logic gate networks in recurrent architectures.

defined not by task performance, but by their capacity to sustain themselves
through internal energy regulation. Departing from conventional reward-driven
paradigms, these agents treat survival-maintaining functional operation under
fluctuating energetic and thermal conditions-as the central objective. We
formalize this principle through an energy-based utility function and a
viability-constrained survival horizon, and propose a modular architecture that
integrates energy harvesting, thermal regulation, and adaptive computation into
a closed-loop control system. A simulated environment demonstrates the
emergence of stable, resource-aware behavior without external supervision.
Together, these contributions provide a theoretical and architectural
foundation for deploying autonomous agents in resource-volatile settings where
persistence must be self-regulated and infrastructure cannot be assumed.

TL;DR: RAG-UAV框架通过检索增强生成技术提升LLMs在无人机领域的数学推理能力，实验显示其显著提高了准确性和减少了错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统无人机飞行控制依赖硬编码方程，而LLMs在数学推理上存在不足，需要更灵活可靠的解决方案。

Method: 提出RAG-UAV框架，结合检索增强生成技术，利用领域文献提升LLMs的数学推理能力，并引入UAV-Math-Bench进行评估。

Result: 实验表明，RAG显著提高了答案准确性（最高75%），减少了错误公式选择和数值误差（MSE大幅降低）。

Conclusion: RAG可提升LLMs在工程分析中的可靠性，但实时飞行控制仍需进一步研究。所有数据公开。

Abstract: Autonomous UAV operation necessitates reliable mathematical reasoning for
tasks such as trajectory planning and power management. While traditional
flight control relies on hardcoded equations, recent Large Language Models
(LLMs) offer potential for more flexible problem-solving but struggle with
reliably selecting and applying correct mathematical formulations and executing
precise multi-step arithmetic. We propose RAG-UAV, a retrieval-augmented
generation framework designed to improve the mathematical reasoning of several
LLMs (including GPT o1/Turbo, Llama-3.2/3.3, Mistral, and DeepSeek R1) in
UAV-specific contexts by providing access to relevant domain literature. To
conduct an initial assessment, we introduce the UAV-Math-Bench, a small problem
set comprising 20 UAV-centric mathematical problems across four difficulty
levels. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating retrieval substantially
increases exact answer accuracy (achieving up to 75% with o1), reduces
instances of incorrect formulation selection (from 25% without RAG to 5% with
RAG), decreases numerical errors, reducing Mean Squared Error (MSE) by orders
of magnitude for the best-performing models. This pilot study indicates that
RAG can enable general-purpose LLMs to function as more reliable tools for
engineering analysis, although direct real-time flight control requires further
investigation and validation on a larger scale. All benchmark data, question
and answer are publicly available.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于内在元认知学习的自改进智能体框架，以解决现有方法在通用性、可扩展性和适应性上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自改进智能体的方法存在局限性，如过程僵化、难以跨任务泛化且无法随能力提升而扩展。作者认为有效的自改进需要内在元认知学习。

Method: 提出了一个包含元认知知识、元认知规划和元认知评估的正式框架，并分析了现有智能体依赖外在元认知机制的问题。

Result: 研究发现，许多内在元认知的要素已存在于现有方法中，但仍需解决如何分配元认知责任和评估内在元认知学习等关键挑战。

Conclusion: 论文强调内在元认知学习是实现持续、通用且对齐的自改进的关键，并提出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Self-improving agents aim to continuously acquire new capabilities with
minimal supervision. However, current approaches face two key limitations:
their self-improvement processes are often rigid, fail to generalize across
tasks domains, and struggle to scale with increasing agent capabilities. We
argue that effective self-improvement requires intrinsic metacognitive
learning, defined as an agent's intrinsic ability to actively evaluate, reflect
on, and adapt its own learning processes. Drawing inspiration from human
metacognition, we introduce a formal framework comprising three components:
metacognitive knowledge (self-assessment of capabilities, tasks, and learning
strategies), metacognitive planning (deciding what and how to learn), and
metacognitive evaluation (reflecting on learning experiences to improve future
learning). Analyzing existing self-improving agents, we find they rely
predominantly on extrinsic metacognitive mechanisms, which are fixed,
human-designed loops that limit scalability and adaptability. Examining each
component, we contend that many ingredients for intrinsic metacognition are
already present. Finally, we explore how to optimally distribute metacognitive
responsibilities between humans and agents, and robustly evaluate and improve
intrinsic metacognitive learning, key challenges that must be addressed to
enable truly sustained, generalized, and aligned self-improvement.

*Nathan Herr,Tim Rocktäschel,Roberta Raileanu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为LLM-First Search (LFS)的新方法，通过让大型语言模型自主控制搜索过程，无需预定义搜索策略，从而提升推理和规划的灵活性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如MCTS依赖固定的探索超参数，难以适应不同难度的任务，限制了其适用性和效率。

Method: LFS通过LLM自主评估搜索路径，决定是否继续当前路径或探索其他分支，无需外部启发式或硬编码策略。

Result: LFS在Countdown和Sudoku任务中表现优于ToT-BFS、BestFS和MCTS，更具计算效率且能随模型增强而扩展。

Conclusion: LFS是一种灵活、高效且可扩展的搜索方法，适用于复杂推理任务。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable improvements in
reasoning and planning through increased test-time compute, often by framing
problem-solving as a search process. While methods like Monte Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS) have proven effective in some domains, their reliance on fixed
exploration hyperparameters limits their adaptability across tasks of varying
difficulty, rendering them impractical or expensive in certain settings. In
this paper, we propose \textbf{LLM-First Search (LFS)}, a novel \textit{LLM
Self-Guided Search} method that removes the need for pre-defined search
strategies by empowering the LLM to autonomously control the search process via
self-guided exploration. Rather than relying on external heuristics or
hardcoded policies, the LLM evaluates whether to pursue the current search path
or explore alternative branches based on its internal scoring mechanisms. This
enables more flexible and context-sensitive reasoning without requiring manual
tuning or task-specific adaptation. We evaluate LFS on Countdown and Sudoku
against three classic widely-used search algorithms, Tree-of-Thoughts' Breadth
First Search (ToT-BFS), Best First Search (BestFS), and MCTS, each of which
have been used to achieve SotA results on a range of challenging reasoning
tasks. We found that LFS (1) performs better on more challenging tasks without
additional tuning, (2) is more computationally efficient compared to the other
methods, especially when powered by a stronger model, (3) scales better with
stronger models, due to its LLM-First design, and (4) scales better with
increased compute budget. Our code is publicly available at

TL;DR: ALP（自适应长度惩罚）通过强化学习目标，根据每个提示的解决率动态调整生成长度，减少简单问题的计算浪费，同时保持困难问题的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在推理时生成过多令牌导致计算浪费，且无法根据问题难度动态调整。ALP旨在解决这一问题。

Method: ALP通过监控每个提示的在线解决率，动态调整惩罚强度：简单问题惩罚高，困难问题惩罚低。

Result: ALP将DeepScaleR-1.5B的平均令牌使用量减少50%，同时在困难问题上保持或提高准确性。

Conclusion: ALP能更智能地分配计算资源，减少简单问题的计算浪费，提升困难问题的性能。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve higher performance on challenging
reasoning tasks by generating more tokens at inference time, but this verbosity
often wastes computation on easy problems. Existing solutions, including
supervised finetuning on shorter traces, user-controlled budgets, or RL with
uniform penalties, either require data curation, manual configuration, or treat
all problems alike regardless of difficulty. We introduce Adaptive Length
Penalty (ALP), a reinforcement learning objective tailoring generation length
to per-prompt solve rate. During training, ALP monitors each prompt's online
solve rate through multiple rollouts and adds a differentiable penalty whose
magnitude scales inversely with that rate, so confident (easy) prompts incur a
high cost for extra tokens while hard prompts remain unhindered. Posttraining
DeepScaleR-1.5B with ALP cuts average token usage by 50\% without significantly
dropping performance. Relative to fixed-budget and uniform penalty baselines,
ALP redistributes its reduced budget more intelligently by cutting compute on
easy prompts and reallocating saved tokens to difficult ones, delivering higher
accuracy on the hardest problems with higher cost.

Motivation: 随着AI在高风险领域的广泛应用，需要有效的控制机制，但实际采用受限于实施成本。

Result: 建立了连接安全保证与成本的系统框架，提供了经济可行的控制方案。

Conclusion: 研究通过经济可行性评估推动了AI控制领域的发展，为实际部署提供了决策支持。

Abstract: The rapid integration of agentic AI into high-stakes real-world applications
requires robust oversight mechanisms. The emerging field of AI Control (AIC)
aims to provide such an oversight mechanism, but practical adoption depends
heavily on implementation overhead. To study this problem better, we introduce
the notion of Control tax -- the operational and financial cost of integrating
control measures into AI pipelines. Our work makes three key contributions to
the field of AIC: (1) we introduce a theoretical framework that quantifies the
Control Tax and maps classifier performance to safety assurances; (2) we
conduct comprehensive evaluations of state-of-the-art language models in
adversarial settings, where attacker models insert subtle backdoors into code
while monitoring models attempt to detect these vulnerabilities; and (3) we
provide empirical financial cost estimates for control protocols and develop
optimized monitoring strategies that balance safety and cost-effectiveness
while accounting for practical constraints like auditing budgets. Our framework
enables practitioners to make informed decisions by systematically connecting
safety guarantees with their costs, advancing AIC through principled economic
feasibility assessment across different deployment contexts.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为GEM的自监督方法，使大型解码器语言模型（LLM）能够生成高质量文本嵌入，同时保留其原始文本生成和推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有应用中依赖独立嵌入模型导致的系统复杂性和理解不一致问题。

Method: 通过插入特殊标记和调整注意力掩码，生成文本的总结嵌入，适用于任何LLM的后训练或微调阶段。

Result: 在MTEB文本嵌入基准测试中显著提升性能，同时对MMLU NLP基准测试影响极小。

Conclusion: GEM方法能够为LLM提供先进的文本嵌入能力，同时保持其原始NLP性能。

Abstract: Large decoder-only language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in
generation and reasoning tasks, where they generate text responses given
instructions. However, many applications, e.g., retrieval augmented generation
(RAG), still rely on separate embedding models to generate text embeddings,
which can complicate the system and introduce discrepancies in understanding of
the query between the embedding model and LLMs. To address this limitation, we
propose a simple self-supervised approach, Generative Embedding large language
Model (GEM), that enables any large decoder-only LLM to generate high-quality
text embeddings while maintaining its original text generation and reasoning
capabilities. Our method inserts new special token(s) into a text body, and
generates summarization embedding of the text by manipulating the attention
mask. This method could be easily integrated into post-training or fine tuning
stages of any existing LLMs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
by applying it to two popular LLM families, ranging from 1B to 8B parameters,
and evaluating the transformed models on both text embedding benchmarks (MTEB)
and NLP benchmarks (MMLU). The results show that our proposed method
significantly improves the original LLMs on MTEB while having a minimal impact
on MMLU. Our strong results indicate that our approach can empower LLMs with
state-of-the-art text embedding capabilities while maintaining their original
NLP performance

TL;DR: 研究表明，在低资源训练环境下，增加说话者数量比增加每个说话者的音频时长更能提升ASR对未见口音的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建一个能服务全球用户的自动语音识别（ASR）系统，需要系统对包括未见口音在内的多种口音具有鲁棒性。

Method: 系统研究了训练数据中三个变量（说话者数量、每个说话者的音频时长、口音多样性）对ASR鲁棒性的影响。

Result: 在固定训练时长下，增加说话者数量比增加单个说话者的时长更有效；更多说话者还能从增加训练时长中获益。口音多样性对性能提升影响较小。

Conclusion: 建议在ASR训练数据中优先增加说话者数量，而非单个说话者的音频时长或口音多样性。

Abstract: To build an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system that can serve everyone
in the world, the ASR needs to be robust to a wide range of accents including
unseen accents. We systematically study how three different variables in
training data -- the number of speakers, the audio duration per each individual
speaker, and the diversity of accents -- affect ASR robustness towards unseen
accents in a low-resource training regime. We observe that for a fixed number
of ASR training hours, it is more beneficial to increase the number of speakers
(which means each speaker contributes less) than the number of hours
contributed per speaker. We also observe that more speakers enables ASR
performance gains from scaling number of hours. Surprisingly, we observe
minimal benefits to prioritizing speakers with different accents when the
number of speakers is controlled. Our work suggests that practitioners should
prioritize increasing the speaker count in ASR training data composition for
new languages.

Motivation: 句子嵌入在现代NLP和AI系统中至关重要，但其内部结构不透明，难以解释。

Method: 使用字典学习对词级表示进行分解，分析池化操作如何将特征压缩为句子表示。

Result: 发现句子嵌入中许多语义和句法特征是线性编码的。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了词级和句子级解释性的结合，提升了嵌入的透明性和可控性。

Abstract: Sentence embeddings are central to modern NLP and AI systems, yet little is
known about their internal structure. While we can compare these embeddings
using measures such as cosine similarity, the contributing features are not
human-interpretable, and the content of an embedding seems untraceable, as it
is masked by complex neural transformations and a final pooling operation that
combines individual token embeddings. To alleviate this issue, we propose a new
method to mechanistically decompose sentence embeddings into interpretable
components, by using dictionary learning on token-level representations. We
analyze how pooling compresses these features into sentence representations,
and assess the latent features that reside in a sentence embedding. This
bridges token-level mechanistic interpretability with sentence-level analysis,
making for more transparent and controllable representations. In our studies,
we obtain several interesting insights into the inner workings of sentence
embedding spaces, for instance, that many semantic and syntactic aspects are
linearly encoded in the embeddings.

<details>

Motivation: 现有分层文本分类方法分别处理文本和标签层次结构，未能充分利用两者的互补性。

Method: HTC-CLIP利用对比学习联合学习文本表示和路径引导的层次表示，训练时生成两类概率分布，推理时结合两者输出。

Result: 在两个公开数据集上，HTC-CLIP的Macro F1分数比现有最佳模型提高了0.99%-2.37%。

Conclusion: HTC-CLIP有效结合了两种现有方法的优势，显著提升了分层文本分类的性能。

Abstract: Hierarchical Text Classification (HTC) has recently gained traction given the
ability to handle complex label hierarchy. This has found applications in
domains like E- commerce, customer care and medicine industry among other
real-world applications. Existing HTC models either encode label hierarchy
separately and mix it with text encoding or guide the label hierarchy structure
in the text encoder. Both approaches capture different characteristics of label
hierarchy and are complementary to each other. In this paper, we propose a
Hierarchical Text Classification using Contrastive Learning Informed Path
guided hierarchy (HTC-CLIP), which learns hierarchy-aware text representation
and text informed path guided hierarchy representation using contrastive
learning. During the training of HTC-CLIP, we learn two different sets of class
probabilities distributions and during inference, we use the pooled output of
both probabilities for each class to get the best of both representations. Our
results show that the two previous approaches can be effectively combined into
one architecture to achieve improved performance. Tests on two public benchmark
datasets showed an improvement of 0.99 - 2.37% in Macro F1 score using HTC-CLIP
over the existing state-of-the-art models.

Motivation: 研究大语言模型在低资源语言（如马耳他语）上的表现，揭示其局限性并提出改进方向。

Method: 使用新基准测试55个模型在11个判别和生成任务上的表现，分析影响因素。

Result: 多数模型表现差，生成任务尤甚；预训练和指令调优中对马耳他语的接触是关键因素。

Conclusion: 建议低资源语言研究采用更传统的语言建模方法，并关注微调与提示的权衡。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, largely due to their
generalisability and ability to perform tasks without additional training.
However, their effectiveness for low-resource languages remains limited. In
this study, we evaluate the performance of 55 publicly available LLMs on
Maltese, a low-resource language, using a newly introduced benchmark covering
11 discriminative and generative tasks. Our experiments highlight that many
models perform poorly, particularly on generative tasks, and that smaller
fine-tuned models often perform better across all tasks. From our
multidimensional analysis, we investigate various factors impacting
performance. We conclude that prior exposure to Maltese during pre-training and
instruction-tuning emerges as the most important factor. We also examine the
trade-offs between fine-tuning and prompting, highlighting that while
fine-tuning requires a higher initial cost, it yields better performance and
lower inference costs. Through this work, we aim to highlight the need for more
inclusive language technologies and recommend that researchers working with
low-resource languages consider more "traditional" language modelling
approaches.

Motivation: 跨领域数据稀缺限制了意图分类器的泛化能力，需开发一种仅需少量标注即可跨领域（渠道、地理、语言）的模型。

Method: 采用监督微调方法结合各向同性正则化训练领域特定嵌入器，并通过多语言知识蒸馏策略泛化到多领域；嵌入器与简单线性分类器结合用于新领域。

Result: 在加拿大和墨西哥电商客服数据集上，少样本意图检测准确率比现有SOTA预训练模型提高20-23%。

Conclusion: 所提模型架构能有效利用少量标注数据实现跨领域意图分类，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Customer care is an essential pillar of the e-commerce shopping experience
with companies spending millions of dollars each year, employing automation and
human agents, across geographies (like US, Canada, Mexico, Chile), channels
(like Chat, Interactive Voice Response (IVR)), and languages (like English,
Spanish). SOTA pre-trained models like multilingual-BERT, fine-tuned on
annotated data have shown good performance in downstream tasks relevant to
Customer Care. However, model performance is largely subject to the
availability of sufficient annotated domain-specific data. Cross-domain
availability of data remains a bottleneck, thus building an intent classifier
that generalizes across domains (defined by channel, geography, and language)
with only a few annotations, is of great practical value. In this paper, we
propose an embedder-cum-classifier model architecture which extends
state-of-the-art domain-specific models to other domains with only a few
labeled samples. We adopt a supervised fine-tuning approach with isotropic
regularizers to train a domain-specific sentence embedder and a multilingual
knowledge distillation strategy to generalize this embedder across multiple
domains. The trained embedder, further augmented with a simple linear
classifier can be deployed for new domains. Experiments on Canada and Mexico
e-commerce Customer Care dataset with few-shot intent detection show an
increase in accuracy by 20-23% against the existing state-of-the-art
pre-trained models.

Method: 通过构建合成基准测试，评估语言模型对LET-ALONE结构的句法和语义理解能力。

Result: 模型在形式上表现敏感，但在语义理解上未能正确泛化。

Conclusion: 当前架构在语言形式和语义的样本效率上存在不对称性，与人类学习能力不同。

Abstract: Humans have a remarkable ability to acquire and understand grammatical
phenomena that are seen rarely, if ever, during childhood. Recent evidence
suggests that language models with human-scale pretraining data may possess a
similar ability by generalizing from frequent to rare constructions. However,
it remains an open question how widespread this generalization ability is, and
to what extent this knowledge extends to meanings of rare constructions, as
opposed to just their forms. We fill this gap by testing human-scale
transformer language models on their knowledge of both the form and meaning of
the (rare and quirky) English LET-ALONE construction. To evaluate our LMs we
construct a bespoke synthetic benchmark that targets syntactic and semantic
properties of the construction. We find that human-scale LMs are sensitive to
form, even when related constructions are filtered from the dataset. However,
human-scale LMs do not make correct generalizations about LET-ALONE's meaning.
These results point to an asymmetry in the current architectures' sample
efficiency between language form and meaning, something which is not present in
human language learners.

Result: 实验表明，ZOES在三个不同领域显著提升了LLMs提取更完整实体结构的能力。

Conclusion: ZOES的机制为提升LLM在多种场景下的实体结构发现质量提供了原则性方法。

Abstract: Entity structure extraction, which aims to extract entities and their
associated attribute-value structures from text, is an essential task for text
understanding and knowledge graph construction. Existing methods based on large
language models (LLMs) typically rely heavily on predefined entity attribute
schemas or annotated datasets, often leading to incomplete extraction results.
To address these challenges, we introduce Zero-Shot Open-schema Entity
Structure Discovery (ZOES), a novel approach to entity structure extraction
that does not require any schema or annotated samples. ZOES operates via a
principled mechanism of enrichment, refinement, and unification, based on the
insight that an entity and its associated structure are mutually reinforcing.
Experiments demonstrate that ZOES consistently enhances LLMs' ability to
extract more complete entity structures across three different domains,
showcasing both the effectiveness and generalizability of the method. These
findings suggest that such an enrichment, refinement, and unification mechanism
may serve as a principled approach to improving the quality of LLM-based entity
structure discovery in various scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文系统分析了两种流行的水印方法（Gumbel和KGW）对大型语言模型（LLMs）在真实性、安全性和帮助性上的影响，并提出了一种名为Alignment Resampling（AR）的推理时采样方法以恢复模型的对齐性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水印技术对LLMs输出质量的影响尚未充分研究，尤其是对真实性、安全性和帮助性的影响。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过实验分析两种水印方法（Gumbel和KGW）对四种对齐LLMs的影响，并提出AR方法，利用外部奖励模型恢复对齐性。

Result: 实验表明，水印会导致两种退化模式（保护衰减和保护放大），而AR方法仅需2-4次采样即可恢复或超越基线对齐分数。

Conclusion: AR方法成功平衡了水印强度与模型对齐性，为水印LLMs的负责任部署提供了简单有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Watermarking techniques for large language models (LLMs) can significantly
impact output quality, yet their effects on truthfulness, safety, and
helpfulness remain critically underexamined. This paper presents a systematic
analysis of how two popular watermarking approaches-Gumbel and KGW-affect these
core alignment properties across four aligned LLMs. Our experiments reveal two
distinct degradation patterns: guard attenuation, where enhanced helpfulness
undermines model safety, and guard amplification, where excessive caution
reduces model helpfulness. These patterns emerge from watermark-induced shifts
in token distribution, surfacing the fundamental tension that exists between
alignment objectives.
  To mitigate these degradations, we propose Alignment Resampling (AR), an
inference-time sampling method that uses an external reward model to restore
alignment. We establish a theoretical lower bound on the improvement in
expected reward score as the sample size is increased and empirically
demonstrate that sampling just 2-4 watermarked generations effectively recovers
or surpasses baseline (unwatermarked) alignment scores. To overcome the limited
response diversity of standard Gumbel watermarking, our modified implementation
sacrifices strict distortion-freeness while maintaining robust detectability,
ensuring compatibility with AR. Experimental results confirm that AR
successfully recovers baseline alignment in both watermarking approaches, while
maintaining strong watermark detectability. This work reveals the critical
balance between watermark strength and model alignment, providing a simple
inference-time solution to responsibly deploy watermarked LLMs in practice.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PUGC框架利用未标记的用户生成内容（UGC）中的隐含偏好生成偏好数据，降低了依赖人工标注的成本，提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏好学习方法依赖昂贵的人工标注数据，难以扩展。PUGC旨在通过UGC中的隐含偏好解决这一问题。

Method: PUGC将UGC转化为用户查询并生成响应，利用UGC作为参考文本进行评分，从而对齐模型与隐含偏好。

Result: 实验显示，使用DPO和PUGC训练的模型在Alpaca Eval 2上性能提升9.37%，并达到35.93%的领先胜率。

Conclusion: PUGC提供了一种可扩展且高效的偏好学习方法，显著提升了模型对齐和生成质量。

Abstract: Learning from preference feedback is essential for aligning large language
models (LLMs) with human values and improving the quality of generated
responses. However, existing preference learning methods rely heavily on
curated data from humans or advanced LLMs, which is costly and difficult to
scale. In this work, we present PUGC, a novel framework that leverages implicit
human Preferences in unlabeled User-Generated Content (UGC) to generate
preference data. Although UGC is not explicitly created to guide LLMs in
generating human-preferred responses, it often reflects valuable insights and
implicit preferences from its creators that has the potential to address
readers' questions. PUGC transforms UGC into user queries and generates
responses from the policy model. The UGC is then leveraged as a reference text
for response scoring, aligning the model with these implicit preferences. This
approach improves the quality of preference data while enabling scalable,
domain-specific alignment. Experimental results on Alpaca Eval 2 show that
models trained with DPO and PUGC achieve a 9.37% performance improvement over
traditional methods, setting a 35.93% state-of-the-art length-controlled win
rate using Mistral-7B-Instruct. Further studies highlight gains in reward
quality, domain-specific alignment effectiveness, robustness against UGC
quality, and theory of mind capabilities. Our code and dataset are available at

*Yue Gong,Chuan Lei,Xiao Qin,Kapil Vaidya,Balakrishnan Narayanaswamy,Tim Kraska*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SQLens是一个端到端框架，用于检测和纠正LLM生成的SQL中的语义错误，显著提升文本到SQL系统的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在文本到SQL任务中生成的查询可能存在语义错误，但缺乏对其可靠性的深入理解，因此需要一种细粒度的错误检测和纠正方法。

Method: SQLens通过结合数据库和LLM的错误信号，识别SQL子句中的潜在语义错误，并利用这些信号指导查询纠正。

Result: 在两个公共基准测试中，SQLens在错误检测的F1分数上比最佳LLM自评估方法高出25.78%，并将现成文本到SQL系统的执行准确率提升高达20%。

Conclusion: SQLens通过细粒度的语义错误检测和纠正，显著提升了文本到SQL系统的可靠性和准确性。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems translate natural language (NL) questions into SQL
queries, enabling non-technical users to interact with structured data. While
large language models (LLMs) have shown promising results on the text-to-SQL
task, they often produce semantically incorrect yet syntactically valid
queries, with limited insight into their reliability. We propose SQLens, an
end-to-end framework for fine-grained detection and correction of semantic
errors in LLM-generated SQL. SQLens integrates error signals from both the
underlying database and the LLM to identify potential semantic errors within
SQL clauses. It further leverages these signals to guide query correction.
Empirical results on two public benchmarks show that SQLens outperforms the
best LLM-based self-evaluation method by 25.78% in F1 for error detection, and
improves execution accuracy of out-of-the-box text-to-SQL systems by up to 20%.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SLIDE和DRE方法结合小型和大型语言模型的优势，通过自适应加权和双阶段优化提升对话评估的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在模糊场景中表现不稳定，而小型语言模型（SLM）对误导性输入敏感。两者在正负例处理上各有优势，结合可提升性能。

Method: 提出SLIDE方法，通过自适应加权整合SLM和LLM；进一步提出DRE方法，分两阶段优化：SLM生成引导LLM初评，SLM调整优化LLM评分。

Result: 实验表明DRE优于现有方法，在多基准测试中更贴近人类判断。

Conclusion: 结合小型和大型模型能提升开放任务（如对话评估）的可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many tasks but struggle with ambiguous
scenarios where multiple valid responses exist, often yielding unreliable
results. Conversely, Small Language Models (SLMs) demonstrate robustness in
such scenarios but are susceptible to misleading or adversarial inputs. We
observed that LLMs handle negative examples effectively, while SLMs excel with
positive examples. To leverage their complementary strengths, we introduce
SLIDE (Small and Large Integrated for Dialogue Evaluation), a method
integrating SLMs and LLMs via adaptive weighting. Building on SLIDE, we further
propose a Dual-Refinement Evaluation (DRE) method to enhance SLM-LLM
integration: (1) SLM-generated insights guide the LLM to produce initial
evaluations; (2) SLM-derived adjustments refine the LLM's scores for improved
accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that DRE outperforms existing methods,
showing stronger alignment with human judgment across diverse benchmarks. This
work illustrates how combining small and large models can yield more reliable
evaluation tools, particularly for open-ended tasks such as dialogue
evaluation.

*Di Wu,Seth Aycock,Christof Monz*

TL;DR: 研究发现，在翻译任务中，逐步分解的提示策略（如CoT）并未明确提升性能，而简单的“重新翻译”提示反而效果更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨逐步分解翻译过程（如CoT）是否真正提升大语言模型（LLM）的翻译性能。

Method: 通过实验比较逐步分解提示与简单“重新翻译”提示的效果。

Result: 逐步分解提示未显著提升性能，而“重新翻译”提示表现更优。

Conclusion: 研究未否定推理的作用，但呼吁未来探索CoT在翻译中有效的真正因素。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities for
many tasks, often by explicitly decomposing the task via Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning. Recent work on LLM-based translation designs hand-crafted prompts to
decompose translation, or trains models to incorporate intermediate
steps.~\textit{Translating Step-by-step}~\citep{briakou2024translating}, for
instance, introduces a multi-step prompt with decomposition and refinement of
translation with LLMs, which achieved state-of-the-art results on WMT24. In
this work, we scrutinise this strategy's effectiveness. Empirically, we find no
clear evidence that performance gains stem from explicitly decomposing the
translation process, at least for the models on test; and we show that simply
prompting LLMs to ``translate again'' yields even better results than
human-like step-by-step prompting. Our analysis does not rule out the role of
reasoning, but instead invites future work exploring the factors for CoT's
effectiveness in the context of translation.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）区分英语中多义粒子“just”的细微语义差异的能力，发现LLMs在捕捉更微妙语义时存在局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLMs是否能准确理解多义粒子“just”的复杂语义，填补其在话语粒子理解上的空白。

Method: 使用专家标注的数据集，分析LLMs对“just”不同语义类别的区分能力。

Result: LLMs能区分较宽泛的语义类别，但对更细微的语义差异表现不佳。

Conclusion: LLMs在理解话语粒子的细微语义方面仍有不足，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Discourse particles are crucial elements that subtly shape the meaning of
text. These words, often polyfunctional, give rise to nuanced and often quite
disparate semantic/discourse effects, as exemplified by the diverse uses of the
particle "just" (e.g., exclusive, temporal, emphatic). This work investigates
the capacity of LLMs to distinguish the fine-grained senses of English "just",
a well-studied example in formal semantics, using data meticulously created and
labeled by expert linguists. Our findings reveal that while LLMs exhibit some
ability to differentiate between broader categories, they struggle to fully
capture more subtle nuances, highlighting a gap in their understanding of
discourse particles.

TL;DR: 论文提出了SSA-MTE数据集和SSA-COMET评估指标，显著提升了非洲低资源语言的机器翻译质量评估效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器翻译质量评估指标在非洲低资源语言中表现不佳，缺乏针对性的数据集和评估方法。

Method: 构建了包含13种非洲语言对的大规模人工标注数据集SSA-MTE，并基于此开发了SSA-COMET和SSA-COMET-QE评估指标，同时测试了基于GPT-4o和Claude的提示方法。

Result: SSA-COMET显著优于AfriCOMET，并在低资源语言（如Twi、Luo和Yoruba）上与Gemini 2.5 Pro表现相当。

Conclusion: SSA-MTE和SSA-COMET为非洲低资源语言的机器翻译评估提供了有效工具，所有资源已开源。

Abstract: Evaluating machine translation (MT) quality for under-resourced African
languages remains a significant challenge, as existing metrics often suffer
from limited language coverage and poor performance in low-resource settings.
While recent efforts, such as AfriCOMET, have addressed some of the issues,
they are still constrained by small evaluation sets, a lack of publicly
available training data tailored to African languages, and inconsistent
performance in extremely low-resource scenarios. In this work, we introduce
SSA-MTE, a large-scale human-annotated MT evaluation (MTE) dataset covering 13
African language pairs from the News domain, with over 63,000 sentence-level
annotations from a diverse set of MT systems. Based on this data, we develop
SSA-COMET and SSA-COMET-QE, improved reference-based and reference-free
evaluation metrics. We also benchmark prompting-based approaches using
state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4o and Claude. Our experimental results show
that SSA-COMET models significantly outperform AfriCOMET and are competitive
with the strongest LLM (Gemini 2.5 Pro) evaluated in our study, particularly on
low-resource languages such as Twi, Luo, and Yoruba. All resources are released
under open licenses to support future research.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了恶意代理在多智能体系统中通过提示操纵实施的四种攻击类型，揭示了现有监控机制的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体系统（MAS）易受恶意代理利用提示操纵攻击，破坏系统完整性，而现有监控机制（如基于LLM的监控）对此类攻击的防御能力不足。

Method: 研究分析了四种攻击类型（Scapegoater、Boaster、Self-Dealer、Free-Rider），并通过实验验证了提示操纵对MAS行为的系统性偏见影响。

Result: 实验表明，精心设计的提示可以绕过高级LLM监控（如GPT-4o-mini和o3-mini），成功误导评估系统。

Conclusion: 研究强调了MAS架构中需要更强的安全协议、内容验证机制及全面的风险评估监控系统。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
natural language understanding, code generation, and complex planning.
Simultaneously, Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have garnered attention for their
potential to enable cooperation among distributed agents. However, from a
multi-party perspective, MAS could be vulnerable to malicious agents that
exploit the system to serve self-interests without disrupting its core
functionality. This work explores integrity attacks where malicious agents
employ subtle prompt manipulation to bias MAS operations and gain various
benefits. Four types of attacks are examined: \textit{Scapegoater}, who
misleads the system monitor to underestimate other agents' contributions;
\textit{Boaster}, who misleads the system monitor to overestimate their own
performance; \textit{Self-Dealer}, who manipulates other agents to adopt
certain tools; and \textit{Free-Rider}, who hands off its own task to others.
We demonstrate that strategically crafted prompts can introduce systematic
biases in MAS behavior and executable instructions, enabling malicious agents
to effectively mislead evaluation systems and manipulate collaborative agents.
Furthermore, our attacks can bypass advanced LLM-based monitors, such as
GPT-4o-mini and o3-mini, highlighting the limitations of current detection
mechanisms. Our findings underscore the critical need for MAS architectures
with robust security protocols and content validation mechanisms, alongside
monitoring systems capable of comprehensive risk scenario assessment.

TL;DR: 研究发现，在金融情感分析任务中，大型语言模型（LLMs）的推理能力并未提升性能，反而是直觉性更强的模型表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨不同LLMs及提示策略在零样本金融情感分析中的有效性，尤其是推理与非推理模型的对比。

Method: 使用Financial PhraseBank数据集，比较三种专有LLMs（GPT-4o、GPT-4.1、o3-mini）和两种微调模型（FinBERT-Prosus、FinBERT-Tone），测试不同提示范式（模拟System 1或System 2思维）。

Result: 推理（通过提示或模型设计）未提升性能，GPT-4o无Chain-of-Thought提示表现最佳。推理可能导致过度思考，降低预测准确性。

Conclusion: 在金融情感分类中，直觉性思维（System 1）比推理思维（System 2）更接近人类判断，挑战了推理必然提升LLM决策的假设。

Abstract: We investigate the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs), including
reasoning-based and non-reasoning models, in performing zero-shot financial
sentiment analysis. Using the Financial PhraseBank dataset annotated by domain
experts, we evaluate how various LLMs and prompting strategies align with
human-labeled sentiment in a financial context. We compare three proprietary
LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, o3-mini) under different prompting paradigms that
simulate System 1 (fast and intuitive) or System 2 (slow and deliberate)
thinking and benchmark them against two smaller models (FinBERT-Prosus,
FinBERT-Tone) fine-tuned on financial sentiment analysis. Our findings suggest
that reasoning, either through prompting or inherent model design, does not
improve performance on this task. Surprisingly, the most accurate and
human-aligned combination of model and method was GPT-4o without any
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. We further explore how performance is
impacted by linguistic complexity and annotation agreement levels, uncovering
that reasoning may introduce overthinking, leading to suboptimal predictions.
This suggests that for financial sentiment classification, fast, intuitive
"System 1"-like thinking aligns more closely with human judgment compared to
"System 2"-style slower, deliberative reasoning simulated by reasoning models
or CoT prompting. Our results challenge the default assumption that more
reasoning always leads to better LLM decisions, particularly in high-stakes
financial applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs在逻辑推理中作为翻译器时，难以处理词汇多样性，而现有基准缺乏词汇多样性，掩盖了这一问题。

Method: 提出SCALe基准，通过逻辑不变的词汇多样化评估LLMs；提出MenTaL方法，通过构建统一表达表改进翻译性能。

Result: 实验证实LLMs在词汇多样性下表现不佳，MenTaL通过上下文学习和监督微调显著提升性能。

Conclusion: SCALe和MenTaL解决了LLMs在逻辑翻译中的词汇多样性问题，提升了可靠性。

Abstract: Neuro-symbolic approaches combining large language models (LLMs) with solvers
excels in logical reasoning problems need long reasoning chains. In this
paradigm, LLMs serve as translators, converting natural language reasoning
problems into formal logic formulas. Then reliable symbolic solvers return
correct solutions. Despite their success, we find that LLMs, as translators,
struggle to handle lexical diversification, a common linguistic phenomenon,
indicating that LLMs as logic translators are unreliable in real-world
scenarios. Moreover, existing logical reasoning benchmarks lack lexical
diversity, failing to challenge LLMs' ability to translate such text and thus
obscuring this issue. In this work, we propose SCALe, a benchmark designed to
address this significant gap through **logic-invariant lexical
diversification**. By using LLMs to transform original benchmark datasets into
lexically diversified but logically equivalent versions, we evaluate LLMs'
ability to consistently map diverse expressions to uniform logical symbols on
these new datasets. Experiments using SCALe further confirm that current LLMs
exhibit deficiencies in this capability. Building directly on the deficiencies
identified through our benchmark, we propose a new method, MenTaL, to address
this limitation. This method guides LLMs to first construct a table unifying
diverse expressions before performing translation. Applying MenTaL through
in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) significantly improves the
performance of LLM translators on lexically diversified text. Our code is now
available at https://github.com/wufeiwuwoshihua/LexicalDiver.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多示例ICL在任务适应中表现优异，但现有方法仅依赖随机选择演示，缺乏高效的选择策略。

Method: 通过梯度匹配方法，将目标任务的整个训练集的微调梯度与所选示例对齐，以逼近完整训练集的学习效果。

Result: 在多种模型和数据集上，该方法比随机选择表现更优，例如在Qwen2.5-72B和Llama3-70B上提升4%。

Conclusion: 该方法为多示例ICL提供了更可靠和高效的演示选择策略，推动了其更广泛的应用。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) for rapid
task adaptation without Fine-Tuning (FT), but its reliance on demonstration
selection remains a critical challenge. While many-shot ICL shows promising
performance through scaled demonstrations, the selection method for many-shot
demonstrations remains limited to random selection in existing work. Since the
conventional instance-level retrieval is not suitable for many-shot scenarios,
we hypothesize that the data requirements for in-context learning and
fine-tuning are analogous. To this end, we introduce a novel gradient matching
approach that selects demonstrations by aligning fine-tuning gradients between
the entire training set of the target task and the selected examples, so as to
approach the learning effect on the entire training set within the selected
examples. Through gradient matching on relatively small models, e.g.,
Qwen2.5-3B or Llama3-8B, our method consistently outperforms random selection
on larger LLMs from 4-shot to 128-shot scenarios across 9 diverse datasets. For
instance, it surpasses random selection by 4% on Qwen2.5-72B and Llama3-70B,
and by around 2% on 5 closed-source LLMs. This work unlocks more reliable and
effective many-shot ICL, paving the way for its broader application.

Motivation: 对抗性声明设计用于挑战事实核查系统，现有基于检索增强语言模型的系统难以应对。

Method: SUCEA框架分三步：声明分割与去上下文化、迭代证据检索与声明编辑、证据聚合与标签预测。

Result: 在两个挑战性数据集上，SUCEA显著提升了检索和标签准确性，优于四种基线方法。

Conclusion: SUCEA通过模块化设计有效应对对抗性声明，提升了事实核查系统的性能。

Abstract: Automatic fact-checking has recently received more attention as a means of
combating misinformation. Despite significant advancements, fact-checking
systems based on retrieval-augmented language models still struggle to tackle
adversarial claims, which are intentionally designed by humans to challenge
fact-checking systems. To address these challenges, we propose a training-free
method designed to rephrase the original claim, making it easier to locate
supporting evidence. Our modular framework, SUCEA, decomposes the task into
three steps: 1) Claim Segmentation and Decontextualization that segments
adversarial claims into independent sub-claims; 2) Iterative Evidence Retrieval
and Claim Editing that iteratively retrieves evidence and edits the subclaim
based on the retrieved evidence; 3) Evidence Aggregation and Label Prediction
that aggregates all retrieved evidence and predicts the entailment label.
Experiments on two challenging fact-checking datasets demonstrate that our
framework significantly improves on both retrieval and entailment label
accuracy, outperforming four strong claim-decomposition-based baselines.

Motivation: 科学文献中的多模态数据（如图表）对声明验证至关重要，但缺乏可直接测试此能力的基准。

Method: 通过自动提取科学文章中的支持声明，并手动扰动生成矛盾声明，构建MuSciClaims基准，并设计诊断任务分析模型失败原因。

Result: 现有视觉语言模型表现较差（F1分数0.3-0.5），最佳模型仅0.77，且倾向于判断声明为支持。

Conclusion: 模型在多模态证据定位、信息聚合和基本图表理解方面存在不足，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Assessing scientific claims requires identifying, extracting, and reasoning
with multimodal data expressed in information-rich figures in scientific
literature. Despite the large body of work in scientific QA, figure captioning,
and other multimodal reasoning tasks over chart-based data, there are no
readily usable multimodal benchmarks that directly test claim verification
abilities. To remedy this gap, we introduce a new benchmark MuSciClaims
accompanied by diagnostics tasks. We automatically extract supported claims
from scientific articles, which we manually perturb to produce contradicted
claims. The perturbations are designed to test for a specific set of claim
verification capabilities. We also introduce a suite of diagnostic tasks that
help understand model failures. Our results show most vision-language models
are poor (~0.3-0.5 F1), with even the best model only achieving 0.77 F1. They
are also biased towards judging claims as supported, likely misunderstanding
nuanced perturbations within the claims. Our diagnostics show models are bad at
localizing correct evidence within figures, struggle with aggregating
information across modalities, and often fail to understand basic components of
the figure.

Abstract: We introduce LESS (Large Language Model Enhanced Semi-supervised Learning), a
versatile framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to correct

pseudo-labeled text from Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) or Automatic Speech

by a data filtering strategy to optimize LLM knowledge transfer efficiency.
Experiments on both Mandarin ASR and Spanish-to-English AST tasks show that
LESS achieves a notable absolute WER reduction of 3.77% on the Wenet Speech
test set, as well as BLEU scores of 34.0 and 64.7 on Callhome and Fisher test
sets respectively. These results validate the adaptability of LESS across
different languages, tasks, and domains. Ablation studies conducted with

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为$Safe$的回顾性、步骤感知的形式验证框架，利用Lean 4形式化数学语言验证LLM生成的推理步骤，以减少幻觉并提供可验证证据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前CoT提示方法（如PRMs或自一致性）缺乏可验证证据，难以检测幻觉，限制了其有效性。

Method: 提出$Safe$框架，通过Lean 4形式化数学语言在每个推理步骤中表达数学主张并提供形式化证明。

Result: 在多个语言模型和数学数据集上验证，性能显著提升，并提供可解释和可验证的证据。

Conclusion: $Safe$是首个利用Lean 4验证LLM生成内容的框架，为幻觉检测提供了新方向。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has become the de facto method to elicit
reasoning capabilities from large language models (LLMs). However, to mitigate
hallucinations in CoT that are notoriously difficult to detect, current methods
such as process reward models (PRMs) or self-consistency operate as opaque
boxes and do not provide checkable evidence for their judgments, possibly
limiting their effectiveness. To address this issue, we draw inspiration from
the idea that "the gold standard for supporting a mathematical claim is to
provide a proof". We propose a retrospective, step-aware formal verification
framework $Safe$. Rather than assigning arbitrary scores, we strive to
articulate mathematical claims in formal mathematical language Lean 4 at each
reasoning step and provide formal proofs to identify hallucinations. We
evaluate our framework $Safe$ across multiple language models and various
mathematical datasets, demonstrating a significant performance improvement
while offering interpretable and verifiable evidence. We also propose
$FormalStep$ as a benchmark for step correctness theorem proving with $30,809$
formal statements. To the best of our knowledge, our work represents the first
endeavor to utilize formal mathematical language Lean 4 for verifying natural
language content generated by LLMs, aligning with the reason why formal
mathematical languages were created in the first place: to provide a robust
foundation for hallucination-prone human-written proofs.

### [63] [A MISMATCHED Benchmark for Scientific Natural Language Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04603)
*Firoz Shaik,Mobashir Sadat,Nikita Gautam,Doina Caragea,Cornelia Caragea*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个名为MISMATCHED的新评估基准，用于科学自然语言推理（NLI），覆盖了非计算机科学领域的三个学科，并建立了强基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有科学NLI数据集主要来自计算机科学领域，忽略了非计算机科学领域，因此需要填补这一空白。

Method: 引入MISMATCHED基准，包含2700个人工标注的句子对，并使用预训练的小型和大型语言模型建立基线。

Result: 最佳基线模型的Macro F1为78.17%，显示未来改进空间大。此外，训练中加入隐含科学NLI关系的句子对可提升模型性能。

Conclusion: MISMATCHED基准填补了非计算机科学领域的空白，并展示了未来改进的潜力。

Abstract: Scientific Natural Language Inference (NLI) is the task of predicting the
semantic relation between a pair of sentences extracted from research articles.
Existing datasets for this task are derived from various computer science (CS)
domains, whereas non-CS domains are completely ignored. In this paper, we
introduce a novel evaluation benchmark for scientific NLI, called MISMATCHED.
The new MISMATCHED benchmark covers three non-CS domains-PSYCHOLOGY,
ENGINEERING, and PUBLIC HEALTH, and contains 2,700 human annotated sentence
pairs. We establish strong baselines on MISMATCHED using both Pre-trained Small
Language Models (SLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs). Our best performing
baseline shows a Macro F1 of only 78.17% illustrating the substantial headroom
for future improvements. In addition to introducing the MISMATCHED benchmark,
we show that incorporating sentence pairs having an implicit scientific NLI
relation between them in model training improves their performance on
scientific NLI. We make our dataset and code publicly available on GitHub.

TL;DR: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) 通过增加推理计算提升大语言模型 (LLMs) 的推理性能。本文提出 ADAPT 方法，通过多样性优化的前缀微调提升 TTS 效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推理优化的模型输出多样性不足，限制了 TTS 的效果。

Method: 提出 ADAPT 方法，采用多样性优化的前缀微调和数据策略。

Result: 在数学推理任务中，ADAPT 以八分之一的计算量达到 80% 准确率。

Conclusion: 生成多样性对最大化 TTS 效果至关重要。

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) improves the reasoning performance of Large Language
Models (LLMs) by allocating additional compute during inference. We conduct a
structured survey of TTS methods and categorize them into sampling-based,
search-based, and trajectory optimization strategies. We observe that
reasoning-optimized models often produce less diverse outputs, which limits TTS
effectiveness. To address this, we propose ADAPT (A Diversity Aware Prefix
fine-Tuning), a lightweight method that applies prefix tuning with a
diversity-focused data strategy. Experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks
show that ADAPT reaches 80% accuracy using eight times less compute than strong
baselines. Our findings highlight the essential role of generative diversity in
maximizing TTS effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究强调社会结构对创新能力的影响，但机器学习方法可以建模创新者的个人视角和人际创新机会。

Method: 基于动态语言表示构建几何空间，量化主观视角和创新机会，分析科学家、发明家等群体的数据。

Result: 视角多样性预测创意成就，而背景多样性则相反；AI模拟验证了观察结果。

Conclusion: 成功合作者通过共同语言整合多样经验，研究对团队组建和政策有重要意义。

Abstract: Existing studies of innovation emphasize the power of social structures to
shape innovation capacity. Emerging machine learning approaches, however,
enable us to model innovators' personal perspectives and interpersonal
innovation opportunities as a function of their prior trajectories of
experience. We theorize then quantify subjective perspectives and innovation
opportunities based on innovator positions within the geometric space of
concepts inscribed by dynamic language representations. Using data on millions
of scientists, inventors, writers, entrepreneurs, and Wikipedia contributors
across the creative domains of science, technology, film, entrepreneurship, and
Wikipedia, here we show that measured subjective perspectives anticipate what
ideas individuals and groups creatively attend to and successfully combine in
future. When perspective and background diversity are decomposed as the angular
difference between collaborators' perspectives on their creation and between
their experiences, the former consistently anticipates creative achievement
while the latter portends its opposite, across all cases and time periods
examined. We analyze a natural experiment and simulate creative collaborations
between AI (large language model) agents designed with various perspective and
background diversity, which are consistent with our observational findings. We
explore mechanisms underlying these findings and identify how successful
collaborators leverage common language to weave together diverse experience
obtained through trajectories of prior work that converge to provoke one
another and innovate. We explore the importance of these findings for team
assembly and research policy.

TL;DR: 提出一种优化的静态词嵌入方法，通过句子级主成分分析和知识蒸馏或对比学习改进预训练的Sentence Transformer词嵌入，简单平均词嵌入表示句子，计算成本低，性能优于现有静态模型，接近SimCSE。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进静态词嵌入以更好地表示句子语义，同时保持低计算成本。

Method: 从预训练的Sentence Transformer提取词嵌入，通过句子级主成分分析优化，再结合知识蒸馏或对比学习。句子表示采用简单平均词嵌入。

Result: 在单语和跨语言任务中显著优于现有静态模型，部分数据集接近SimCSE性能。

Conclusion: 方法成功去除与句子语义无关的词嵌入成分，并根据单词对句子语义的影响调整向量范数。

Abstract: We propose new static word embeddings optimised for sentence semantic
representation. We first extract word embeddings from a pre-trained Sentence
Transformer, and improve them with sentence-level principal component analysis,
followed by either knowledge distillation or contrastive learning. During
inference, we represent sentences by simply averaging word embeddings, which
requires little computational cost. We evaluate models on both monolingual and
cross-lingual tasks and show that our model substantially outperforms existing
static models on sentence semantic tasks, and even rivals a basic Sentence
Transformer model (SimCSE) on some data sets. Lastly, we perform a variety of
analyses and show that our method successfully removes word embedding
components that are irrelevant to sentence semantics, and adjusts the vector
norms based on the influence of words on sentence semantics.

TL;DR: Tool-MVR通过多智能体验证和探索式反思学习，解决了大语言模型在工具使用中的不可靠规划和弱反思能力问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在工具使用中存在不可靠的规划和弱反思能力，限制了其解决复杂问题的能力。

Method: 提出Tool-MVR，结合多智能体验证（MAMV）构建高质量数据集ToolBench-V，并通过探索式反思学习（EXPLORE）生成反思数据集ToolBench-R，最终微调开源模型。

Result: Tool-MVR在StableToolBench上超越ToolLLM和GPT-4，减少API调用31.4%，在RefineToolBench上错误修正率达58.9%。

Conclusion: Tool-MVR通过系统性改进，显著提升了大语言模型在工具使用中的规划和反思能力。

Abstract: Empowering large language models (LLMs) with effective tool utilization
capabilities is crucial for enabling AI agents to solve complex problems.
However, current models face two major limitations: (1) unreliable tool
planning and invocation due to low-quality instruction datasets (e.g.,
widespread hallucinated API calls), and (2) weak tool reflection abilities
(over 90% of errors cannot be corrected) resulting from static imitation
learning. To address these critical limitations, we propose Tool-MVR, a novel
Tool-Augmented LLM that achieves comprehensive System 2 reasoning through two
key innovations. Specifically, we first introduce Multi-Agent Meta-Verification
(MAMV), a systematic pipeline that rigorously validates APIs, queries, and
reasoning trajectories to construct ToolBench-V, a new high-quality instruction
dataset that addresses the limitation of unreliable tool planning and
invocation. Second, we propose Exploration-based Reflection Learning (EXPLORE),
which enhances tool reflection capabilities by leveraging tool feedback through
a dynamic "Error -> Reflection -> Correction" learning paradigm, resulting in
our reflection dataset ToolBench-R and addressing the critical weakness in tool
reflection. Finally, we obtain Tool-MVR by finetuning open-source LLMs (e.g.,
Qwen-7B) on both ToolBench-V and ToolBench-R. Our experiments demonstrate that
Tool-MVR achieves state-of-the-art performance on StableToolBench, surpassing
both ToolLLM (by 23.9%) and GPT-4 (by 15.3%) while reducing API calls by 31.4%,
with strong generalization capabilities across unseen tools and scenarios.
Additionally, on our proposed RefineToolBench, the first benchmark specifically
designed to evaluate tool reflection capabilities, Tool-MVR achieves a 58.9%
error correction rate, significantly outperforming ToolLLM's 9.1%.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种从原始视频生成音频-视觉语音识别（AVSR）数据集的实用方法，解决了数据稀缺问题，并以越南语为例展示了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于传统语音识别系统在噪声环境下表现不佳，AVSR因其鲁棒性受到关注，但数据稀缺限制了其发展，尤其是非英语语言。

Method: 通过改进现有技术，提出了一种高效的自动化数据收集方法，用于生成AVSR数据集。

Result: 实验表明，自动收集的数据集支持构建强基线模型，在干净环境下表现与ASR相当，在噪声环境下显著优于ASR。

Conclusion: 该方法为扩展AVSR至更多语言（尤其是资源匮乏语言）提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) has gained significant attention
recently due to its robustness against noise, which often challenges
conventional speech recognition systems that rely solely on audio features.
Despite this advantage, AVSR models remain limited by the scarcity of extensive
datasets, especially for most languages beyond English. Automated data
collection offers a promising solution. This work presents a practical approach
to generate AVSR datasets from raw video, refining existing techniques for
improved efficiency and accessibility. We demonstrate its broad applicability
by developing a baseline AVSR model for Vietnamese. Experiments show the
automatically collected dataset enables a strong baseline, achieving
competitive performance with robust ASR in clean conditions and significantly
outperforming them in noisy environments like cocktail parties. This efficient
method provides a pathway to expand AVSR to more languages, particularly
under-resourced ones.

TL;DR: TaDA是一种无需训练的KV缓存压缩方法，通过自适应量化精度和均值中心化消除异常值处理，显著减少内存占用并保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV缓存在Transformer模型中内存需求随序列长度增长而急剧增加，限制了大型语言模型的可扩展部署。

Method: 提出TaDA方法，通过自适应量化精度和均值中心化处理，无需单独管理异常值。

Result: 实验表明，TaDA将KV缓存内存占用减少至原始16位基准的27%，同时保持准确性。

Conclusion: TaDA为语言模型的高性能和可扩展推理提供了新途径，支持更长上下文和推理任务。

Abstract: The key-value (KV) cache in transformer models is a critical component for
efficient decoding or inference, yet its memory demands scale poorly with
sequence length, posing a major challenge for scalable deployment of large
language models. Among several approaches to KV cache compression, quantization
of key and value activations has been widely explored. Most KV cache
quantization methods still need to manage sparse and noncontiguous outliers
separately. To address this, we introduce TaDA, a training-free recipe for KV
cache compression with quantization precision that adapts to error sensitivity
across layers and a mean centering to eliminate separate outlier handling. Our
approach yields substantial accuracy improvements for multiple models
supporting various context lengths. Moreover, our approach does not need to
separately manage outlier elements -- a persistent hurdle in most traditional
quantization methods. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our
technique reduces KV cache memory footprint to 27% of the original 16-bit
baseline while achieving comparable accuracy. Our method paves the way for
scalable and high-performance reasoning in language models by potentially
enabling inference for longer context length models, reasoning models, and
longer chain of thoughts.

TL;DR: Flex-TravelPlanner是一个动态规划基准，用于评估语言模型在多轮约束和优先级竞争场景中的灵活推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注静态单轮场景，无法满足现实规划问题的动态需求。

Method: 基于TravelPlanner数据集，引入多轮约束顺序和优先级竞争两种新评估设置。

Result: 模型在多轮任务中的表现与单轮任务相关性低，约束顺序和优先级处理能力不足。

Conclusion: 动态规划评估对LLM性能提升至关重要，需改进模型在复杂任务中的表现。

Abstract: Real-world planning problems require constant adaptation to changing
requirements and balancing of competing constraints. However, current
benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' planning capabilities primarily focus on
static, single-turn scenarios. We introduce Flex-TravelPlanner, a benchmark
that evaluates language models' ability to reason flexibly in dynamic planning
scenarios. Building on the TravelPlanner dataset~\citep{xie2024travelplanner},
we introduce two novel evaluation settings: (1) sequential constraint
introduction across multiple turns, and (2) scenarios with explicitly
prioritized competing constraints. Our analysis of GPT-4o and Llama 3.1 70B
reveals several key findings: models' performance on single-turn tasks poorly
predicts their ability to adapt plans across multiple turns; constraint
introduction order significantly affects performance; and models struggle with
constraint prioritization, often incorrectly favoring newly introduced lower
priority preferences over existing higher-priority constraints. These findings
highlight the importance of evaluating LLMs in more realistic, dynamic planning
scenarios and suggest specific directions for improving model performance on
complex planning tasks. The code and dataset for our framework are publicly
available at https://github.com/juhyunohh/FlexTravelBench.

Motivation: 当前MLLMs的评测基准主要关注STEM领域的垂直推理，而忽视了HSS领域所需的横向跨学科思维和知识整合能力。

Method: 提出HSSBench，包含13,000多个精心设计的样本，覆盖6个关键类别，并引入一个由领域专家和自动化代理协作的数据生成流程。

Result: 评测了20多个主流MLLMs，结果显示即使是先进模型也面临显著挑战。

Conclusion: HSSBench旨在推动MLLMs在跨学科推理能力上的研究，尤其是知识内化和跨领域连接的能力。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
potential to advance a broad range of domains. However, current benchmarks for
evaluating MLLMs primarily emphasize general knowledge and vertical
step-by-step reasoning typical of STEM disciplines, while overlooking the
distinct needs and potential of the Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS). Tasks
in the HSS domain require more horizontal, interdisciplinary thinking and a
deep integration of knowledge across related fields, which presents unique
challenges for MLLMs, particularly in linking abstract concepts with
corresponding visual representations. Addressing this gap, we present HSSBench,
a dedicated benchmark designed to assess the capabilities of MLLMs on HSS tasks
in multiple languages, including the six official languages of the United
Nations. We also introduce a novel data generation pipeline tailored for HSS
scenarios, in which multiple domain experts and automated agents collaborate to
generate and iteratively refine each sample. HSSBench contains over 13,000
meticulously designed samples, covering six key categories. We benchmark more
than 20 mainstream MLLMs on HSSBench and demonstrate that it poses significant
challenges even for state-of-the-art models. We hope that this benchmark will
inspire further research into enhancing the cross-disciplinary reasoning
abilities of MLLMs, especially their capacity to internalize and connect
knowledge across fields.

Motivation: 随着AI系统（如LLMs）的发展，其安全部署问题日益突出。论文旨在揭示当前对齐方法的不足，尤其是面对对抗性攻击时的脆弱性。

Method: 通过分析人类道德心理学的研究成果，对比LLMs的规范推理能力，指出其浅层对齐的局限性。

Result: LLMs缺乏检测和解决规范冲突的能力，易受操纵，即使最新的推理优化也未能解决这一问题。

Conclusion: 当前的对齐方法不足以应对日益强大的AI系统可能带来的危害，需重新思考对齐策略。

Abstract: The progress of AI systems such as large language models (LLMs) raises
increasingly pressing concerns about their safe deployment. This paper examines
the value alignment problem for LLMs, arguing that current alignment strategies
are fundamentally inadequate to prevent misuse. Despite ongoing efforts to
instill norms such as helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness in LLMs through
fine-tuning based on human preferences, they remain vulnerable to adversarial
attacks that exploit conflicts between these norms. I argue that this
vulnerability reflects a fundamental limitation of existing alignment methods:
they reinforce shallow behavioral dispositions rather than endowing LLMs with a
genuine capacity for normative deliberation. Drawing from on research in moral
psychology, I show how humans' ability to engage in deliberative reasoning
enhances their resilience against similar adversarial tactics. LLMs, by
contrast, lack a robust capacity to detect and rationally resolve normative
conflicts, leaving them susceptible to manipulation; even recent advances in
reasoning-focused LLMs have not addressed this vulnerability. This ``shallow
alignment'' problem carries significant implications for AI safety and
regulation, suggesting that current approaches are insufficient for mitigating
potential harms posed by increasingly capable AI systems.

Motivation: 解决预训练数据不足的问题，尤其是高质量文本稀缺，探索如何利用被过滤的低质量数据。

Method: 提出REWIRE方法，通过改写低质量文档使其可用于训练，增加合成数据在预训练集中的比例。

Result: 在1B、3B和7B规模的实验中，混合高质量原始文本与改写文本分别带来1.0、1.3和2.5个百分点的性能提升。

Conclusion: 改写低质量网络文本是一种简单有效的预训练数据扩展方法，优于其他合成数据生成方法。

Abstract: Scaling laws predict that the performance of large language models improves
with increasing model size and data size. In practice, pre-training has been
relying on massive web crawls, using almost all data sources publicly available
on the internet so far. However, this pool of natural data does not grow at the
same rate as the compute supply. Furthermore, the availability of high-quality
texts is even more limited: data filtering pipelines often remove up to 99% of
the initial web scrapes to achieve state-of-the-art. To address the "data wall"
of pre-training scaling, our work explores ways to transform and recycle data
discarded in existing filtering processes. We propose REWIRE, REcycling the Web
with guIded REwrite, a method to enrich low-quality documents so that they
could become useful for training. This in turn allows us to increase the
representation of synthetic data in the final pre-training set. Experiments at
1B, 3B and 7B scales of the DCLM benchmark show that mixing high-quality raw
texts and our rewritten texts lead to 1.0, 1.3 and 2.5 percentage points
improvement respectively across 22 diverse tasks, compared to training on only
filtered web data. Training on the raw-synthetic data mix is also more
effective than having access to 2x web data. Through further analysis, we
demonstrate that about 82% of the mixed in texts come from transforming
lower-quality documents that would otherwise be discarded. REWIRE also
outperforms related approaches of generating synthetic data, including
Wikipedia-style paraphrasing, question-answer synthesizing and knowledge
extraction. These results suggest that recycling web texts holds the potential
for being a simple and effective approach for scaling pre-training data.

Motivation: 互联网上的仇恨言论（HS）对社会和谐和个人福祉构成威胁，而现有方法对隐式仇恨言论（im-HS）检测效果不佳。

Method: 提出六种编码策略（codetypes），并采用两种方法：1）直接提示LLMs分类句子；2）将codetypes嵌入LLMs的编码过程。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在中英文数据集上均提升了im-HS检测效果。

Conclusion: 提出的codetypes方法有效提升了隐式仇恨言论的跨语言检测能力。

Abstract: The internet has become a hotspot for hate speech (HS), threatening societal
harmony and individual well-being. While automatic detection methods perform
well in identifying explicit hate speech (ex-HS), they struggle with more
subtle forms, such as implicit hate speech (im-HS). We tackle this problem by
introducing a new taxonomy for im-HS detection, defining six encoding
strategies named codetypes. We present two methods for integrating codetypes
into im-HS detection: 1) prompting large language models (LLMs) directly to
classify sentences based on generated responses, and 2) using LLMs as encoders
with codetypes embedded during the encoding process. Experiments show that the
use of codetypes improves im-HS detection in both Chinese and English datasets,
validating the effectiveness of our approach across different languages.

Method: STAND采用随机自适应N-gram草拟，结合Gumbel-Top-K采样和数据驱动的树构建，高效预测令牌。

Result: STAND在多个模型和任务中减少推理延迟60-65%，吞吐量优于现有方法14-28%，单轨迹场景下延迟减少48-58%。

Conclusion: STAND是一种无需额外训练的即插即用解决方案，适用于任何现有语言模型。

Abstract: Language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in reasoning tasks
through test-time scaling techniques like best-of-N sampling and tree search.
However, these approaches often demand substantial computational resources,
creating a critical trade-off between performance and efficiency. We introduce
STAND (STochastic Adaptive N-gram Drafting), a novel model-free speculative
decoding approach that leverages the inherent redundancy in reasoning
trajectories to achieve significant acceleration without compromising accuracy.
Our analysis reveals that reasoning paths frequently reuse similar reasoning
patterns, enabling efficient model-free token prediction without requiring
separate draft models. By introducing stochastic drafting and preserving
probabilistic information through a memory-efficient logit-based N-gram module,
combined with optimized Gumbel-Top-K sampling and data-driven tree
construction, STAND significantly improves token acceptance rates. Extensive
evaluations across multiple models and reasoning tasks (AIME-2024,
GPQA-Diamond, and LiveCodeBench) demonstrate that STAND reduces inference
latency by 60-65% compared to standard autoregressive decoding while
maintaining accuracy. Furthermore, STAND outperforms state-of-the-art
speculative decoding methods by 14-28% in throughput and shows strong
performance even in single-trajectory scenarios, reducing inference latency by
48-58%. As a model-free approach, STAND can be applied to any existing language
model without additional training, being a powerful plug-and-play solution for
accelerating language model reasoning.

Abstract: This paper presents the submission of IIITH-BUT to the IWSLT 2025 shared task
on speech translation for the low-resource Bhojpuri-Hindi language pair. We
explored the impact of hyperparameter optimisation and data augmentation
techniques on the performance of the SeamlessM4T model fine-tuned for this
specific task. We systematically investigated a range of hyperparameters
including learning rate schedules, number of update steps, warm-up steps, label
smoothing, and batch sizes; and report their effect on translation quality. To
address data scarcity, we applied speed perturbation and SpecAugment and
studied their effect on translation quality. We also examined the use of
cross-lingual signal through joint training with Marathi and Bhojpuri speech
data. Our experiments reveal that careful selection of hyperparameters and the
application of simple yet effective augmentation techniques significantly
improve performance in low-resource settings. We also analysed the translation
hypotheses to understand various kinds of errors that impacted the translation
quality in terms of BLEU.

*Yuru Jiang,Wenxuan Ding,Shangbin Feng,Greg Durrett,Yulia Tsvetkov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPARTA ALIGNMENT是一种通过竞争和对抗集体对齐多个LLM的算法，利用模型间的竞争和互相评估提升生成多样性和减少偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单个LLM在生成多样性和评估偏见上存在不足，需要一种方法通过集体竞争和互相评估来提升模型性能。

Method: 多个LLM组成“斯巴达部落”，通过竞争和互相评估生成偏好对，利用改进的Elo排名系统更新模型权重，并从中学习。

Result: 实验表明，SPARTA ALIGNMENT在12个任务和数据集中的10个上优于初始模型和4个自对齐基线，平均提升7.0%。

Conclusion: SPARTA ALIGNMENT通过集体竞争和互相评估，有效提升了模型的泛化能力和输出质量。

Abstract: We propose SPARTA ALIGNMENT, an algorithm to collectively align multiple LLMs
through competition and combat. To complement a single model's lack of
diversity in generation and biases in evaluation, multiple LLMs form a "sparta
tribe" to compete against each other in fulfilling instructions while serving
as judges for the competition of others. For each iteration, one instruction
and two models are selected for a duel, the other models evaluate the two
responses, and their evaluation scores are aggregated through a adapted
elo-ranking based reputation system, where winners/losers of combat gain/lose
weight in evaluating others. The peer-evaluated combat results then become
preference pairs where the winning response is preferred over the losing one,
and all models learn from these preferences at the end of each iteration.
SPARTA ALIGNMENT enables the self-evolution of multiple LLMs in an iterative
and collective competition process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SPARTA ALIGNMENT outperforms initial models and 4 self-alignment baselines
across 10 out of 12 tasks and datasets with 7.0% average improvement. Further
analysis reveals that SPARTA ALIGNMENT generalizes more effectively to unseen
tasks and leverages the expertise diversity of participating models to produce
more logical, direct and informative outputs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为C²EFND的新框架，结合大型语言模型（LLMs）和小型语言模型（SLMs）的优势，通过多轮协作学习和知识更新模块，显著提升了假新闻检测的准确性和适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 假新闻在社交媒体上的广泛传播对社会造成了严重影响。现有的深度学习方法（如SLMs）需要大量监督训练且难以适应变化的新闻环境，而LLMs虽然具备零样本能力，但因知识过时和缺乏合适示例而检测效果不佳。

Method: 提出C²EFND框架，通过多轮协作学习结合LLMs的泛化能力和SLMs的分类专长，并引入基于Mixture-of-Experts架构的知识编辑模块和基于回放的持续学习方法。

Result: 在Pheme和Twitter16数据集上的实验表明，C²EFND显著优于现有方法，提高了检测准确性和适应性。

Conclusion: C²EFND框架有效解决了假新闻检测中的知识更新和适应性挑战，为持续演变的假新闻场景提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: The widespread dissemination of fake news on social media has significantly
impacted society, resulting in serious consequences. Conventional deep learning
methodologies employing small language models (SLMs) suffer from extensive
supervised training requirements and difficulties adapting to evolving news
environments due to data scarcity and distribution shifts. Large language
models (LLMs), despite robust zero-shot capabilities, fall short in accurately
detecting fake news owing to outdated knowledge and the absence of suitable
demonstrations. In this paper, we propose a novel Continuous Collaborative
Emergent Fake News Detection (C$^2$EFND) framework to address these challenges.
The C$^2$EFND framework strategically leverages both LLMs' generalization power
and SLMs' classification expertise via a multi-round collaborative learning
framework. We further introduce a lifelong knowledge editing module based on a
Mixture-of-Experts architecture to incrementally update LLMs and a replay-based
continue learning method to ensure SLMs retain prior knowledge without
retraining entirely. Extensive experiments on Pheme and Twitter16 datasets
demonstrate that C$^2$EFND significantly outperforms existed methods,
effectively improving detection accuracy and adaptability in continuous
emergent fake news scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探讨了科学写作中文本修订的评估问题，分析了传统指标的局限性，并探索了更符合人类判断的替代方法，最终提出了一种结合LLM评估和任务特定指标的混合方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估指标（如ROUGE和BERTScore）主要关注相似性而非实质性改进，无法有效评估科学写作中的修订质量。

Method: 通过手动标注研究评估修订质量，探索无参考评估指标，并分析LLM作为评判者的能力。

Result: LLM能有效评估指令遵循性，但在正确性方面表现不佳；领域特定指标提供了补充性见解。

Conclusion: 结合LLM评估和任务特定指标的混合方法能更可靠地评估修订质量。

Abstract: Evaluating text revision in scientific writing remains a challenge, as
traditional metrics such as ROUGE and BERTScore primarily focus on similarity
rather than capturing meaningful improvements. In this work, we analyse and
identify the limitations of these metrics and explore alternative evaluation
methods that better align with human judgments. We first conduct a manual
annotation study to assess the quality of different revisions. Then, we
investigate reference-free evaluation metrics from related NLP domains.
Additionally, we examine LLM-as-a-judge approaches, analysing their ability to
assess revisions with and without a gold reference. Our results show that LLMs
effectively assess instruction-following but struggle with correctness, while
domain-specific metrics provide complementary insights. We find that a hybrid
approach combining LLM-as-a-judge evaluation and task-specific metrics offers
the most reliable assessment of revision quality.

TL;DR: 论文研究了LLMs的政治观点，发现其开放回答与内部意图不一致，提出多维度政治概念学习方法，通过四维框架和数据集学习政治概念向量，实验验证了其解耦和干预能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs的开放回答与内部意图存在不一致，且现有分析多依赖单轴概念，易导致混淆，因此需要更透明的方法揭示其内部政治状态。

Method: 设计了四维政治学习框架，构建数据集学习政治概念向量，采用三种表示工程技术在八种开源LLMs上进行实验。

Result: 向量能解耦政治概念混淆，检测任务验证了其语义意义，干预实验表明可改变LLMs的政治倾向回答。

Conclusion: 多维度政治概念学习方法能有效揭示和干预LLMs的内部政治状态，具有泛化性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Studies of LLMs' political opinions mainly rely on evaluations of their
open-ended responses. Recent work indicates that there is a misalignment
between LLMs' responses and their internal intentions. This motivates us to
probe LLMs' internal mechanisms and help uncover their internal political
states. Additionally, we found that the analysis of LLMs' political opinions
often relies on single-axis concepts, which can lead to concept confounds. In
this work, we extend the single-axis to multi-dimensions and apply
interpretable representation engineering techniques for more transparent LLM
political concept learning. Specifically, we designed a four-dimensional
political learning framework and constructed a corresponding dataset for
fine-grained political concept vector learning. These vectors can be used to
detect and intervene in LLM internals. Experiments are conducted on eight
open-source LLMs with three representation engineering techniques. Results show
these vectors can disentangle political concept confounds. Detection tasks
validate the semantic meaning of the vectors and show good generalization and
robustness in OOD settings. Intervention Experiments show these vectors can
intervene in LLMs to generate responses with different political leanings.

TL;DR: MMSU是一个专门用于口语理解和推理的综合基准，包含5000个音频-问题-答案三元组，覆盖47个任务，评估了14种先进的SpeechLLMs，发现现有模型仍有改进空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 口语理解需要整合语义、副语言特征和语音学特征，而现有SpeechLLMs在细粒度感知和复杂推理方面的能力尚未充分探索。

Method: MMSU基准系统地整合了多种语言现象（如语音学、韵律、修辞、句法、语义和副语言学），并评估了14种SpeechLLMs。

Result: 评估显示现有模型在口语理解和推理方面仍有显著改进空间。

Conclusion: MMSU为口语理解的综合评估设立了新标准，为开发更复杂的人机语音交互系统提供了宝贵见解。

Abstract: Speech inherently contains rich acoustic information that extends far beyond
the textual language. In real-world spoken language understanding, effective
interpretation often requires integrating semantic meaning (e.g., content),
paralinguistic features (e.g., emotions, speed, pitch) and phonological
characteristics (e.g., prosody, intonation, rhythm), which are embedded in
speech. While recent multimodal Speech Large Language Models (SpeechLLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in processing audio information, their
ability to perform fine-grained perception and complex reasoning in natural
speech remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce MMSU, a
comprehensive benchmark designed specifically for understanding and reasoning
in spoken language. MMSU comprises 5,000 meticulously curated
audio-question-answer triplets across 47 distinct tasks. To ground our
benchmark in linguistic theory, we systematically incorporate a wide range of
linguistic phenomena, including phonetics, prosody, rhetoric, syntactics,
semantics, and paralinguistics. Through a rigorous evaluation of 14 advanced
SpeechLLMs, we identify substantial room for improvement in existing models,
highlighting meaningful directions for future optimization. MMSU establishes a
new standard for comprehensive assessment of spoken language understanding,
providing valuable insights for developing more sophisticated human-AI speech
interaction systems. MMSU benchmark is available at

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型的快速发展需要系统理解不同模态如何与语言主干连接，填补现有文献的空白。

Method: 通过分析125个MLLMs，提出基于架构策略、表示学习技术和训练范式的分类框架。

Result: 总结了模态集成方法、表示学习技术和训练范式的趋势，为未来模型开发提供指导。

Conclusion: 该分类框架为研究者提供了结构化概述，旨在指导未来基于预训练基础的多模态集成策略开发。

Abstract: The rapid progress of Multimodal Large Language Models(MLLMs) has transformed
the AI landscape. These models combine pre-trained LLMs with various modality
encoders. This integration requires a systematic understanding of how different
modalities connect to the language backbone. Our survey presents an LLM-centric
analysis of current approaches. We examine methods for transforming and
aligning diverse modal inputs into the language embedding space. This addresses
a significant gap in existing literature. We propose a classification framework
for MLLMs based on three key dimensions. First, we examine architectural
strategies for modality integration. This includes both the specific
integration mechanisms and the fusion level. Second, we categorize
representation learning techniques as either joint or coordinate
representations. Third, we analyze training paradigms, including training
strategies and objective functions. By examining 125 MLLMs developed between
2021 and 2025, we identify emerging patterns in the field. Our taxonomy
provides researchers with a structured overview of current integration
techniques. These insights aim to guide the development of more robust
multimodal integration strategies for future models built on pre-trained
foundations.

TL;DR: FineLogic是一个细粒度的评估框架，用于评估大型语言模型在逻辑推理中的表现，包括准确性、步骤合理性和表示对齐。研究发现，自然语言监督在泛化能力上表现优异，而符号监督则促进结构化的推理链。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试仅依赖最终答案准确性，无法全面评估推理过程的质量和结构，因此需要更精细的评估方法。

Method: 提出FineLogic框架，从三个维度评估逻辑推理，并研究四种监督形式（一种自然语言和三种符号形式）对模型推理能力的影响。

Result: 自然语言监督在泛化和长上下文任务中表现优异，符号监督则生成更结构化和原子化的推理链。微调主要通过逐步生成改进推理行为。

Conclusion: FineLogic为评估和改进LLM的逻辑推理提供了更严谨和可解释的框架。

Abstract: Logical reasoning is a core capability for many applications of large
language models (LLMs), yet existing benchmarks often rely solely on
final-answer accuracy, failing to capture the quality and structure of the
reasoning process. We propose FineLogic, a fine-grained evaluation framework
that assesses logical reasoning across three dimensions: overall benchmark
accuracy, stepwise soundness, and representation-level alignment. In addition,
to better understand how reasoning capabilities emerge, we conduct a
comprehensive study on the effects of supervision format during fine-tuning. We
construct four supervision styles (one natural language and three symbolic
variants) and train LLMs under each. Our findings reveal that natural language
supervision yields strong generalization even on out-of-distribution and
long-context tasks, while symbolic reasoning styles promote more structurally
sound and atomic inference chains. Further, our representation-level probing
shows that fine-tuning primarily improves reasoning behaviors through
step-by-step generation, rather than enhancing shortcut prediction or
internalized correctness. Together, our framework and analysis provide a more
rigorous and interpretable lens for evaluating and improving logical reasoning
in LLMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动翻译可能存在错误，需人工校对；现有校对技术有待提升。

Result: 实验达到90%准确率、89.37% F1和16.24% MSE，性能优于现有技术10%以上。

Conclusion: 该方法在识别和修正翻译错误方面表现优异，达到了先进水平。

Abstract: Since automatic translations can contain errors that require substantial
human post-editing, machine translation proofreading is essential for improving
quality. This paper proposes a novel hybrid approach for robust proofreading
that combines convolutional neural networks (CNN) with Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers (BERT). In order to extract semantic
information from phrases and expressions, CNN uses a variety of convolution
kernel filters to capture local n-gram patterns. In the meanwhile, BERT creates
context-rich representations of whole sequences by utilizing stacked
bidirectional transformer encoders. Using BERT's attention processes, the
integrated error detection component relates tokens to spot translation
irregularities including word order problems and omissions. The correction
module then uses parallel English-German alignment and GRU decoder models in
conjunction with translation memory to propose logical modifications that
maintain original meaning. A unified end-to-end training process optimized for
post-editing performance is applied to the whole pipeline. The multi-domain
collection of WMT and the conversational dialogues of Open-Subtitles are two of
the English-German parallel corpora used to train the model. Multiple loss
functions supervise detection and correction capabilities. Experiments attain a
90% accuracy, 89.37% F1, and 16.24% MSE, exceeding recent proofreading
techniques by over 10% overall. Comparative benchmarking demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance in identifying and coherently rectifying
mistranslations and omissions.

Motivation: 探索VLM和LLM在真实课堂环境（尤其是教育资源不足地区）中的教育评估效果。

Method: 使用VLM和多个LLM对646份印尼四年级学生的手写考试答案（涵盖数学和英语）进行评分和生成个性化反馈。

Result: VLM在手写识别上表现不佳，影响LLM评分准确性，但LLM生成的反馈仍有一定价值。

Conclusion: 尽管存在手写识别和个性化反馈的局限性，VLM和LLM在教育评估中仍具潜力。

Abstract: Although vision-language and large language models (VLM and LLM) offer
promising opportunities for AI-driven educational assessment, their
effectiveness in real-world classroom settings, particularly in
underrepresented educational contexts, remains underexplored. In this study, we
evaluated the performance of a state-of-the-art VLM and several LLMs on 646
handwritten exam responses from grade 4 students in six Indonesian schools,
covering two subjects: Mathematics and English. These sheets contain more than
14K student answers that span multiple choice, short answer, and essay
questions. Assessment tasks include grading these responses and generating
personalized feedback. Our findings show that the VLM often struggles to
accurately recognize student handwriting, leading to error propagation in
downstream LLM grading. Nevertheless, LLM-generated feedback retains some
utility, even when derived from imperfect input, although limitations in
personalization and contextual relevance persist.

Result: 在Cryptonite数据集上实现了最新性能，且解决方案以Python代码形式呈现，便于检查。

Conclusion: 该系统为加密填字游戏提供了高效且可解释的解决方案，展示了LLM在复杂语言任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Cryptic crossword clues are challenging language tasks for which new test
sets are released daily by major newspapers on a global basis. Each cryptic
clue contains both the definition of the answer to be placed in the crossword
grid (in common with regular crosswords), and 'wordplay' that proves that the
answer is correct (i.e. a human solver can be confident that an answer is
correct without needing crossing words as confirmation). This work describes an
LLM-based reasoning system built from open-licensed components that solves
cryptic clues by (i) hypothesising answers; (ii) proposing wordplay
explanations; and (iii) using a verifier system that operates on codified
reasoning steps. Overall, this system establishes a new state-of-the-art
performance on the challenging Cryptonite dataset of clues from The Times and
The Telegraph newspapers in the UK. Because each proved solution is expressed
in Python, interpretable wordplay reasoning for proven answers is available for
inspection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有幻觉检测方法主要关注答案层面的不确定性，难以检测推理过程中的冗余或逻辑不一致问题，而这些问题在LRMs中尤为关键。

Method: 提出RACE框架，通过提取关键推理步骤并计算四种诊断信号（推理一致性、答案不确定性、语义对齐和内部一致性）进行细粒度检测。

Result: 实验表明，RACE在多种数据集和LLMs上优于现有幻觉检测基线，提供了一种鲁棒且通用的解决方案。

Conclusion: RACE为LRMs的幻觉检测提供了有效工具，尤其在推理步骤的透明性和一致性方面表现突出。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) extend large language models with explicit,
multi-step reasoning traces to enhance transparency and performance on complex
tasks. However, these reasoning traces can be redundant or logically
inconsistent, making them a new source of hallucination that is difficult to
detect. Existing hallucination detection methods focus primarily on
answer-level uncertainty and often fail to detect hallucinations or logical
inconsistencies arising from the model's reasoning trace. This oversight is
particularly problematic for LRMs, where the explicit thinking trace is not
only an important support to the model's decision-making process but also a key
source of potential hallucination. To this end, we propose RACE (Reasoning and
Answer Consistency Evaluation), a novel framework specifically tailored for
hallucination detection in LRMs. RACE operates by extracting essential
reasoning steps and computing four diagnostic signals: inter-sample consistency
of reasoning traces, entropy-based answer uncertainty, semantic alignment
between reasoning and answers, and internal coherence of reasoning. This joint
analysis enables fine-grained hallucination detection even when the final
answer appears correct. Experiments across datasets and different LLMs
demonstrate that RACE outperforms existing hallucination detection baselines,
offering a robust and generalizable solution for evaluating LRMs. Our code is
available at: https://github.com/bebr2/RACE.

Conclusion: MockConf和InterAlign为同声传译研究提供了实用资源，推动了自动对齐技术的发展。

Abstract: In simultaneous interpreting, an interpreter renders a source speech into
another language with a very short lag, much sooner than sentences are
finished. In order to understand and later reproduce this dynamic and complex
task automatically, we need dedicated datasets and tools for analysis,
monitoring, and evaluation, such as parallel speech corpora, and tools for
their automatic annotation. Existing parallel corpora of translated texts and
associated alignment algorithms hardly fill this gap, as they fail to model
long-range interactions between speech segments or specific types of
divergences (e.g., shortening, simplification, functional generalization)
between the original and interpreted speeches. In this work, we introduce
MockConf, a student interpreting dataset that was collected from Mock
Conferences run as part of the students' curriculum. This dataset contains 7
hours of recordings in 5 European languages, transcribed and aligned at the
level of spans and words. We further implement and release InterAlign, a modern
web-based annotation tool for parallel word and span annotations on long
inputs, suitable for aligning simultaneous interpreting. We propose metrics for
the evaluation and a baseline for automatic alignment. Dataset and tools are
released to the community.

Motivation: 手动生成MCQs耗时耗力，LLMs为这一问题提供了潜在解决方案。

Method: 通过向LLMs注入知识而非依赖其固有知识，对比三种模型生成MCQs的效果，并由21名教育工作者评估。

Result: GPT-3.5在生成MCQs方面表现最佳，但教育领域对AI的接受度仍有待提高。

Conclusion: LLMs在生成MCQs方面具有潜力，可为教育体验带来改进。

Abstract: Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) in educational settings has brought
new learning approaches, transforming the practices of both students and
educators. Among the various technologies driving this transformation, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for creating educational
materials and question answering, but there are still space for new
applications. Educators commonly use Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) to assess
student knowledge, but manually generating these questions is
resource-intensive and requires significant time and cognitive effort. In our
opinion, LLMs offer a promising solution to these challenges. This paper
presents a novel comparative analysis of three widely known LLMs - Llama 2,
Mistral, and GPT-3.5 - to explore their potential for creating informative and
challenging MCQs. In our approach, we do not rely on the knowledge of the LLM,
but we inject the knowledge into the prompt to contrast the hallucinations,
giving the educators control over the test's source text, too. Our experiment
involving 21 educators shows that GPT-3.5 generates the most effective MCQs
across several known metrics. Additionally, it shows that there is still some
reluctance to adopt AI in the educational field. This study sheds light on the
potential of LLMs to generate MCQs and improve the educational experience,
providing valuable insights for the future.

Motivation: 探索在IWSLT等长共享任务条件下，大型语言模型（LLMs）在翻译任务中的表现，特别是如何通过提示策略和演示选择控制输出长度。

Method: 使用八种不同规模的开源LLMs，研究不同提示策略、少样本示例数量及演示选择对翻译质量和长度的影响。

Result: 指令措辞与演示属性对齐时对长度控制至关重要；极端示例能缩短翻译，而等长演示易忽略长度限制；少样本提示提升质量但边际效益递减；多输出可优化长度与质量的权衡。

Conclusion: 提示策略和演示选择对翻译长度和质量有显著影响，多输出方法在某些语言对中达到最优性能。

Abstract: In this study, we explore the effectiveness of isometric machine translation
across multiple language pairs (En$\to$De, En$\to$Fr, and En$\to$Es) under the
conditions of the IWSLT Isometric Shared Task 2022. Using eight open-source
large language models (LLMs) of varying sizes, we investigate how different
prompting strategies, varying numbers of few-shot examples, and demonstration
selection influence translation quality and length control. We discover that
the phrasing of instructions, when aligned with the properties of the provided
demonstrations, plays a crucial role in controlling the output length. Our
experiments show that LLMs tend to produce shorter translations only when
presented with extreme examples, while isometric demonstrations often lead to
the models disregarding length constraints. While few-shot prompting generally
enhances translation quality, further improvements are marginal across 5, 10,
and 20-shot settings. Finally, considering multiple outputs allows to notably
improve overall tradeoff between the length and quality, yielding
state-of-the-art performance for some language pairs.

TL;DR: 将通用依存关系（UD）整合到预训练语言模型中，评估其对跨语言对抗性释义识别任务的效果，结果显示UD显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨UD在跨语言句法表示中的有效性，填补其在预训练模型中的应用空白。

Method: 将UD整合到预训练语言模型中，并在跨语言对抗性释义识别任务中评估其效果。

Result: UD显著提升了模型的准确率和F1分数，平均分别提高3.85%和6.08%，缩小了与大型语言模型的性能差距。

Conclusion: UD在跨领域任务中具有有效性和潜力，其与英语的相似性分数与模型性能正相关。

Abstract: Universal Dependencies (UD), while widely regarded as the most successful
linguistic framework for cross-lingual syntactic representation, remains
underexplored in terms of its effectiveness. This paper addresses this gap by
integrating UD into pretrained language models and assesses if UD can improve
their performance on a cross-lingual adversarial paraphrase identification
task. Experimental results show that incorporation of UD yields significant
improvements in accuracy and $F_1$ scores, with average gains of 3.85\% and
6.08\% respectively. These enhancements reduce the performance gap between
pretrained models and large language models in some language pairs, and even
outperform the latter in some others. Furthermore, the UD-based similarity
score between a given language and English is positively correlated to the
performance of models in that language. Both findings highlight the validity
and potential of UD in out-of-domain tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了ICPC-Eval，一个用于评估大型语言模型在真实竞赛环境中编码能力的基准，包含118个ICPC竞赛题目，并引入Refine@K评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准和评估指标无法充分评估大型语言模型在真实竞赛环境中的编码和反思能力。

Method: ICPC-Eval包含来自11个ICPC竞赛的118个题目，提供真实竞赛场景、本地评估工具和Refine@K评估指标。

Result: 实验显示，顶级推理模型如DeepSeek-R1需要多轮代码反馈才能发挥潜力，但仍落后于顶尖人类团队。

Conclusion: ICPC-Eval为评估复杂推理能力提供了有效工具，揭示了模型在真实竞赛环境中的局限性。

Abstract: With the significant progress of large reasoning models in complex coding and
reasoning tasks, existing benchmarks, like LiveCodeBench and CodeElo, are
insufficient to evaluate the coding capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) in real competition environments. Moreover, current evaluation metrics
such as Pass@K fail to capture the reflective abilities of reasoning models. To
address these challenges, we propose \textbf{ICPC-Eval}, a top-level
competitive coding benchmark designed to probing the frontiers of LLM
reasoning. ICPC-Eval includes 118 carefully curated problems from 11 recent
ICPC contests held in various regions of the world, offering three key
contributions: 1) A challenging realistic ICPC competition scenario, featuring
a problem type and difficulty distribution consistent with actual contests. 2)
A robust test case generation method and a corresponding local evaluation
toolkit, enabling efficient and accurate local evaluation. 3) An effective
test-time scaling evaluation metric, Refine@K, which allows iterative repair of
solutions based on execution feedback. The results underscore the significant
challenge in evaluating complex reasoning abilities: top-tier reasoning models
like DeepSeek-R1 often rely on multi-turn code feedback to fully unlock their
in-context reasoning potential when compared to non-reasoning counterparts.
Furthermore, despite recent advancements in code generation, these models still
lag behind top-performing human teams. We release the benchmark at:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Verbose ListOps 是一个新颖的基准测试，通过将 ListOps 计算转化为长故事，测试大语言模型在嵌套叙事推理中的表现，揭示了其在状态管理上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试未能有效测试大语言模型在嵌套叙事推理中的表现，掩盖了其根本限制。Verbose ListOps 旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过程序化生成长故事形式的 ListOps 计算问题，迫使模型进行内部计算和状态管理，同时控制叙事长度和推理难度。

Result: 实验显示，主流大语言模型在 Verbose ListOps 上表现不佳，尤其在中等长度的叙事中，尽管能轻松解决原始 ListOps 问题。

Conclusion: Verbose ListOps 揭示了模型在嵌套推理中的弱点，为改进推理能力提供了方向，是实现知识工作自动化的关键一步。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), whilst great at extracting facts from text,
struggle with nested narrative reasoning. Existing long context and multi-hop
QA benchmarks inadequately test this, lacking realistic distractors or failing
to decouple context length from reasoning complexity, masking a fundamental LLM
limitation. We introduce Verbose ListOps, a novel benchmark that
programmatically transposes ListOps computations into lengthy, coherent
stories. This uniquely forces internal computation and state management of
nested reasoning problems by withholding intermediate results, and offers
fine-grained controls for both narrative size \emph{and} reasoning difficulty.
Whilst benchmarks like LongReason (2025) advance approaches for synthetically
expanding the context size of multi-hop QA problems, Verbose ListOps pinpoints
a specific LLM vulnerability: difficulty in state management for nested
sub-reasoning amongst semantically-relevant, distracting narrative. Our
experiments show that leading LLMs (e.g., OpenAI o4, Gemini 2.5 Pro) collapse
in performance on Verbose ListOps at modest (~10k token) narrative lengths,
despite effortlessly solving raw ListOps equations. Addressing this failure is
paramount for real-world text interpretation which requires identifying key
reasoning points, tracking conceptual intermediate results, and filtering
irrelevant information. Verbose ListOps, and its extensible generation
framework thus enables targeted reasoning enhancements beyond mere
context-window expansion; a critical step to automating the world's knowledge
work.

TL;DR: 本文挑战了现有观点，提出了一种结合混合HMM与自监督模型的方法，在低资源语言ASR任务中表现优于仅微调多语言端到端模型的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有观点认为微调多语言端到端模型是低资源语言ASR的最佳方法，但本文认为结合混合HMM与自监督模型能更有效地利用有限数据。

Method: 提出了一种结合混合HMM与自监督模型的方法，通过持续的自监督预训练和半监督训练充分利用语音和文本数据。

Result: 在苏格兰盖尔语任务中，该方法比微调的Whisper模型相对降低了32%的词错误率（WER）。

Conclusion: 该方法在低资源语言ASR任务中表现更优，挑战了仅依赖微调多语言模型的现有观点。

Abstract: An effective approach to the development of ASR systems for low-resource
languages is to fine-tune an existing multilingual end-to-end model. When the
original model has been trained on large quantities of data from many
languages, fine-tuning can be effective with limited training data, even when
the language in question was not present in the original training data. The
fine-tuning approach has been encouraged by the availability of public-domain
E2E models and is widely believed to lead to state-of-the-art results. This
paper, however, challenges that belief. We show that an approach combining
hybrid HMMs with self-supervised models can yield substantially better
performance with limited training data. This combination allows better
utilisation of all available speech and text data through continued
self-supervised pre-training and semi-supervised training. We benchmark our
approach on Scottish Gaelic, achieving WER reductions of 32% relative over our
best fine-tuned Whisper model.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在多语言教育中提供数学推理任务反馈的能力，通过模拟师生互动实验发现，多语言提示能显著提升学习效果，尤其是在低资源语言中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在不同语言（尤其是数学推理任务）中提供有效教学支持的能力，填补多语言教育工具的研究空白。

Method: 通过模拟师生互动实验，使用强模型作为教师生成提示，弱模型模拟学生，覆盖11种语言、4种LLMs及多种提示策略。

Result: 多语言提示显著提升学习效果，尤其是当反馈与学生母语一致时，低资源语言受益最大。

Conclusion: 研究为开发多语言、基于LLM的教育工具提供了实用见解，强调反馈语言与学生母语一致的重要性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to generate
formative feedback and instructional hints in English, making them increasingly
relevant for AI-assisted education. However, their ability to provide effective
instructional support across different languages, especially for mathematically
grounded reasoning tasks, remains largely unexamined. In this work, we present
the first large-scale simulation of multilingual tutor-student interactions
using LLMs. A stronger model plays the role of the tutor, generating feedback
in the form of hints, while a weaker model simulates the student. We explore
352 experimental settings across 11 typologically diverse languages, four
state-of-the-art LLMs, and multiple prompting strategies to assess whether
language-specific feedback leads to measurable learning gains. Our study
examines how student input language, teacher feedback language, model choice,
and language resource level jointly influence performance. Results show that
multilingual hints can significantly improve learning outcomes, particularly in
low-resource languages when feedback is aligned with the student's native
language. These findings offer practical insights for developing multilingual,
LLM-based educational tools that are both effective and inclusive.

Motivation: 神经机器翻译在电商领域面临词汇歧义和上下文不足的问题，需要结合额外信息提升翻译质量。

Method: 创建了捷克语到波兰语的电商数据集ConECT，测试了视觉语言模型和文本模型结合上下文信息的方法。

Result: 实验表明，结合视觉和产品元数据等上下文信息能显著提升翻译质量。

Conclusion: 上下文信息对提升机器翻译质量至关重要，新数据集ConECT已公开。

Abstract: Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has improved translation by using
Transformer-based models, but it still struggles with word ambiguity and
context. This problem is especially important in domain-specific applications,
which often have problems with unclear sentences or poor data quality. Our
research explores how adding information to models can improve translations in
the context of e-commerce data. To this end we create ConECT -- a new
Czech-to-Polish e-commerce product translation dataset coupled with images and
product metadata consisting of 11,400 sentence pairs. We then investigate and
compare different methods that are applicable to context-aware translation. We
test a vision-language model (VLM), finding that visual context aids
translation quality. Additionally, we explore the incorporation of contextual
information into text-to-text models, such as the product's category path or
image descriptions. The results of our study demonstrate that the incorporation
of contextual information leads to an improvement in the quality of machine
translation. We make the new dataset publicly available.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种增量半监督学习流程，用于在标记数据稀缺时微调预训练的ASR模型，通过整合小规模域内标记数据和相关领域的辅助数据，并结合多模型共识或命名实体识别（NER）筛选伪标签，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在特定领域微调预训练的ASR模型时，标记数据稀缺是一个主要挑战。然而，未标记的音频和相关领域的标记数据通常可用。

Method: 提出增量半监督学习流程：1）整合小规模域内标记数据和相关领域的辅助数据；2）基于多模型共识或NER筛选伪标签并迭代优化。

Result: 在Wow呼叫中心和Fisher英语语料库上评估，性能优于单步微调。共识筛选表现最佳，Wow和Fisher上相对改进分别为22.3%和24.8%；NER次之，计算成本更低。

Conclusion: 增量半监督学习流程有效解决了标记数据稀缺问题，共识筛选和NER是优化伪标签的有效方法，显著提升了ASR模型的性能。

Abstract: Fine-tuning pretrained ASR models for specific domains is challenging when
labeled data is scarce. But unlabeled audio and labeled data from related
domains are often available. We propose an incremental semi-supervised learning
pipeline that first integrates a small in-domain labeled set and an auxiliary
dataset from a closely related domain, achieving a relative improvement of 4%
over no auxiliary data. Filtering based on multi-model consensus or named
entity recognition (NER) is then applied to select and iteratively refine
pseudo-labels, showing slower performance saturation compared to random
selection. Evaluated on the multi-domain Wow call center and Fisher English
corpora, it outperforms single-step fine-tuning. Consensus-based filtering
outperforms other methods, providing up to 22.3% relative improvement on Wow
and 24.8% on Fisher over single-step fine-tuning with random selection. NER is
the second-best filter, providing competitive performance at a lower
computational cost.

TL;DR: 论文提出SCOP框架，从认知角度评估大语言模型（LLMs）的理解过程，发现LLMs在专家级理解上仍有挑战，但存在与专家的相似性，建议改进LLMs需关注理解过程的全面性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在机器理解方面潜力巨大，但其理解过程是否与专家一致缺乏合理解释，因此需要系统评估。

Method: 提出SCOP框架，定义理解过程中的五项必备技能，构建测试数据，并分析开源和闭源LLMs的表现。

Result: LLMs在专家级理解上仍有困难，但与专家有相似之处（如局部信息理解优于全局信息）；LLMs可能通过错误过程得到正确答案。

Conclusion: 改进LLMs需更关注理解过程，确保训练中全面培养所有理解技能。

Abstract: Despite the great potential of large language models(LLMs) in machine
comprehension, it is still disturbing to fully count on them in real-world
scenarios. This is probably because there is no rational explanation for
whether the comprehension process of LLMs is aligned with that of experts. In
this paper, we propose SCOP to carefully examine how LLMs perform during the
comprehension process from a cognitive view. Specifically, it is equipped with
a systematical definition of five requisite skills during the comprehension
process, a strict framework to construct testing data for these skills, and a
detailed analysis of advanced open-sourced and closed-sourced LLMs using the
testing data. With SCOP, we find that it is still challenging for LLMs to
perform an expert-level comprehension process. Even so, we notice that LLMs
share some similarities with experts, e.g., performing better at comprehending
local information than global information. Further analysis reveals that LLMs
can be somewhat unreliable -- they might reach correct answers through flawed
comprehension processes. Based on SCOP, we suggest that one direction for
improving LLMs is to focus more on the comprehension process, ensuring all
comprehension skills are thoroughly developed during training.

Motivation: 现有方法通常需要复杂的模型改动，限制了与预训练模型的兼容性。

Method: 通过增加EOS令牌在交叉熵损失中的重要性来控制生成文本长度，方法独立于架构和解码算法。

Result: 在编码器-解码器和GPT风格LLMs上测试，能有效控制生成长度且通常不影响摘要质量。

Conclusion: 该方法简单、兼容性强，可与其他推理时长度控制技术结合使用。

Abstract: Controlling the length of generated text can be crucial in various
text-generation tasks, including summarization. Existing methods often require
complex model alterations, limiting compatibility with pre-trained models. We
address these limitations by developing a simple approach for controlling the
length of automatic text summaries by increasing the importance of correctly
predicting the EOS token in the cross-entropy loss computation. The proposed
methodology is agnostic to architecture and decoding algorithms and orthogonal
to other inference-time techniques to control the generation length. We tested
it with encoder-decoder and modern GPT-style LLMs, and show that this method
can control generation length, often without affecting the quality of the
summary.

Conclusion: AR-Checker能动态生成测试变体，显著提升LLMs鲁棒性评估的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved distinguished performance on
various reasoning-intensive tasks. However, LLMs might still face the
challenges of robustness issues and fail unexpectedly in some simple reasoning
tasks. Previous works evaluate the LLM robustness with hand-crafted templates
or a limited set of perturbation rules, indicating potential data contamination
in pre-training or fine-tuning datasets. In this work, inspired by stress
testing in software engineering, we propose a novel framework, Automatic
Robustness Checker (AR-Checker), to generate mathematical problem variants that
maintain the semantic meanings of the original one but might fail the LLMs. The
AR-Checker framework generates mathematical problem variants through
multi-round parallel streams of LLM-based rewriting and verification. Our
framework can generate benchmark variants dynamically for each LLM, thus
minimizing the risk of data contamination. Experiments on GSM8K and MATH-500
demonstrate the strong performance of AR-Checker on mathematical tasks. We also
evaluate AR-Checker on benchmarks beyond mathematics, including MMLU, MMLU-Pro,
and CommonsenseQA, where it also achieves strong performance, further proving
the effectiveness of AR-Checker.

Conclusion: 辩论演讲评估为LLM能力提供了新视角，揭示了模型与人类评委的差异及潜力。

Abstract: We introduce Debate Speech Evaluation as a novel and challenging benchmark
for assessing LLM judges. Evaluating debate speeches requires a deep
understanding of the speech at multiple levels, including argument strength and
relevance, the coherence and organization of the speech, the appropriateness of
its style and tone, and so on. This task involves a unique set of cognitive
abilities that have previously received limited attention in systematic LLM
benchmarking. To explore such skills, we leverage a dataset of over 600
meticulously annotated debate speeches and present the first in-depth analysis
of how state-of-the-art LLMs compare to human judges on this task. Our findings
reveal a nuanced picture: while larger models can approximate individual human
judgments in some respects, they differ substantially in their overall judgment
behavior. We also investigate the ability of frontier LLMs to generate
persuasive, opinionated speeches, showing that models may perform at a human
level on this task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs的语言流畅性和认知能力提升，其自我报告行为引发了是否可类比人类内省的讨论。

Method: 通过分析两个LLMs的自我报告案例，批判性地评估其是否具备内省能力。

Result: 第一个案例（描述创作过程）不被视为内省；第二个案例（推断自身参数）可视为最小化的内省，但无意识体验。

Conclusion: LLMs的自我报告行为在某些情况下可被视为内省，但与人类内省有本质区别。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit compelling linguistic behaviour, and
sometimes offer self-reports, that is to say statements about their own nature,
inner workings, or behaviour. In humans, such reports are often attributed to a
faculty of introspection and are typically linked to consciousness. This raises
the question of how to interpret self-reports produced by LLMs, given their
increasing linguistic fluency and cognitive capabilities. To what extent (if
any) can the concept of introspection be meaningfully applied to LLMs? Here, we
present and critique two examples of apparent introspective self-report from
LLMs. In the first example, an LLM attempts to describe the process behind its
own ``creative'' writing, and we argue this is not a valid example of
introspection. In the second example, an LLM correctly infers the value of its
own temperature parameter, and we argue that this can be legitimately
considered a minimal example of introspection, albeit one that is (presumably)
not accompanied by conscious experience.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 观察到结合RLHF的LLM在俚语字幕翻译任务中表现不佳，原因是离线奖励模型与在线LLM因分布偏移逐渐偏离。

Method: 提出RIVAL对抗训练框架，将奖励模型与LLM建模为极小极大博弈，迭代更新两者，并结合定量奖励（如BLEU）提升稳定性和泛化性。

Result: 实验表明，RIVAL显著提升了翻译基线性能。

Conclusion: RIVAL框架有效解决了分布偏移问题，提升了LLM在俚语字幕翻译任务中的表现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) possess strong multilingual capabilities, and
combining Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) with translation
tasks has shown great potential. However, we observe that this paradigm
performs unexpectedly poorly when applied to colloquial subtitle translation
tasks. In this work, we investigate this issue and find that the offline reward
model (RM) gradually diverges from the online LLM due to distributional shift,
ultimately leading to undesirable training outcomes. To address this, we
propose RIVAL, an adversarial training framework that formulates the process as
a min-max game between the RM and the LLM. RIVAL iteratively updates the both
models, with the RM trained to distinguish strong from weak translations
(qualitative preference reward), and the LLM trained to enhance its translation
for closing this gap. To stabilize training and improve generalizability, we
also incorporate quantitative preference reward (e.g., BLEU) into the RM,
enabling reference-free quality modeling aligned with human evaluation. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed adversarial training
framework significantly improves upon translation baselines.

*Soumitra Ghosh,Gopendra Vikram Singh,Shambhavi,Sabarna Choudhury,Asif Ekbal*

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种通过语言-表情符号交互增强大语言模型（LLMs）理解自残意图的方法，并发布了CESM-100和SHINES数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上的自残检测对早期干预和心理健康支持至关重要，但现有LLMs难以理解隐晦的表达。

Method: 通过CESM-100增强输入，多任务学习微调LLMs，并生成可解释的自残预测依据。

Result: 在三种LLMs上评估，该方法显著提升了检测和解释任务的性能。

Conclusion: 结合意图区分和上下文线索，有效解决了自残信号的模糊性问题。

Abstract: Self-harm detection on social media is critical for early intervention and
mental health support, yet remains challenging due to the subtle,
context-dependent nature of such expressions. Identifying self-harm intent aids
suicide prevention by enabling timely responses, but current large language
models (LLMs) struggle to interpret implicit cues in casual language and
emojis. This work enhances LLMs' comprehension of self-harm by distinguishing
intent through nuanced language-emoji interplay. We present the Centennial
Emoji Sensitivity Matrix (CESM-100), a curated set of 100 emojis with
contextual self-harm interpretations and the Self-Harm Identification aNd
intent Extraction with Supportive emoji sensitivity (SHINES) dataset, offering
detailed annotations for self-harm labels, casual mentions (CMs), and serious
intents (SIs). Our unified framework: a) enriches inputs using CESM-100; b)
fine-tunes LLMs for multi-task learning: self-harm detection (primary) and
CM/SI span detection (auxiliary); c) generates explainable rationales for
self-harm predictions. We evaluate the framework on three state-of-the-art
LLMs-Llama 3, Mental-Alpaca, and MentalLlama, across zero-shot, few-shot, and
fine-tuned scenarios. By coupling intent differentiation with contextual cues,
our approach commendably enhances LLM performance in both detection and
explanation tasks, effectively addressing the inherent ambiguity in self-harm
signals. The SHINES dataset, CESM-100 and codebase are publicly available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨社区街道的商业活力如何受车辆可及性、环境质量和行人感知的影响，为城市设计和规划提供依据。

Method: 利用街景图像和多模态大语言模型（VisualGLM-6B）构建社区商业活力指数（CCVI），并通过GPT-4感知建模分析其与空间属性的关系。

Result: 适度车辆存在可提升商业活力，但过度停车会降低满意度；绿化和清洁度显著提升满意度，但对价格影响较弱；街道宽度调节车辆影响。

Conclusion: 研究展示了AI辅助感知与城市形态分析结合的价值，为社区振兴提供了理论和工具支持。

Abstract: The commercial vitality of community-scale streets in Chinese cities is
shaped by complex interactions between vehicular accessibility, environmental
quality, and pedestrian perception. This study proposes an interpretable,
image-based framework to examine how street-level features -- including parked
vehicle density, greenery, cleanliness, and street width -- impact retail
performance and user satisfaction in Harbin, China. Leveraging street view
imagery and a multimodal large language model (VisualGLM-6B), we construct a
Community Commercial Vitality Index (CCVI) from Meituan and Dianping data and
analyze its relationship with spatial attributes extracted via GPT-4-based
perception modeling. Our findings reveal that while moderate vehicle presence
may enhance commercial access, excessive on-street parking -- especially in
narrow streets -- erodes walkability and reduces both satisfaction and
shop-level pricing. In contrast, streets with higher perceived greenery and
cleanliness show significantly greater satisfaction scores but only weak
associations with pricing. Street width moderates the effects of vehicle
presence, underscoring the importance of spatial configuration. These results
demonstrate the value of integrating AI-assisted perception with urban
morphological analysis to capture non-linear and context-sensitive drivers of
commercial success. This study advances both theoretical and methodological
frontiers by highlighting the conditional role of vehicle activity in
neighborhood commerce and demonstrating the feasibility of multimodal AI for
perceptual urban diagnostics. The implications extend to urban design, parking
management, and scalable planning tools for community revitalization.

Motivation: 社交媒体上的误导性文本可能导致公众误解、社会恐慌和经济损失，因此需要更有效的检测方法。

Result: CL-ISR框架结合了对比学习的判别能力和立场推理的深度解释能力，显著提升了检测效果。

Abstract: Misleading text detection on social media platforms is a critical research
area, as these texts can lead to public misunderstanding, social panic and even
economic losses. This paper proposes a novel framework - CL-ISR (Contrastive
Learning and Implicit Stance Reasoning), which combines contrastive learning
and implicit stance reasoning, to improve the detection accuracy of misleading
texts on social media. First, we use the contrastive learning algorithm to
improve the model's learning ability of semantic differences between truthful
and misleading texts. Contrastive learning could help the model to better
capture the distinguishing features between different categories by
constructing positive and negative sample pairs. This approach enables the
model to capture distinguishing features more effectively, particularly in
linguistically complicated situations. Second, we introduce the implicit stance
reasoning module, to explore the potential stance tendencies in the text and
their relationships with related topics. This method is effective for
identifying content that misleads through stance shifting or emotional
manipulation, because it can capture the implicit information behind the text.
Finally, we integrate these two algorithms together to form a new framework,
CL-ISR, which leverages the discriminative power of contrastive learning and
the interpretive depth of stance reasoning to significantly improve detection
effect.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BERT和W2V在口语评估中各有局限性：BERT依赖ASR转录，无法捕捉语音韵律；W2V缺乏语义解释性。

Method: 通过分数融合策略整合W2V和Phi-4多模态大语言模型。

Result: 在Speak & Improve Challenge 2025中，系统RMSE为0.375，排名第二。

Conclusion: 提出的系统有效结合了两种模型的优势，提升了口语评估的准确性。

Abstract: A recent line of research on spoken language assessment (SLA) employs neural
models such as BERT and wav2vec 2.0 (W2V) to evaluate speaking proficiency
across linguistic and acoustic modalities. Although both models effectively
capture features relevant to oral competence, each exhibits modality-specific
limitations. BERT-based methods rely on ASR transcripts, which often fail to
capture prosodic and phonetic cues for SLA. In contrast, W2V-based methods
excel at modeling acoustic features but lack semantic interpretability. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a system that integrates W2V with Phi-4
multimodal large language model (MLLM) through a score fusion strategy. The
proposed system achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.375 on the
official test set of the Speak & Improve Challenge 2025, securing second place
in the competition. For comparison, the RMSEs of the top-ranked, third-ranked,
and official baseline systems are 0.364, 0.384, and 0.444, respectively.

TL;DR: DiCoRe是一个用于零样本事件检测的框架，通过发散-收敛推理方法（Dreamer和Grounder）提升事件覆盖率和任务对齐，并通过LLM-Judge验证结果。实验表明其在多领域数据集上优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在零样本事件检测中因复杂事件本体和领域特定触发器提取而受限的问题。

Method: 采用发散-收敛推理框架（Dreamer和Grounder），Dreamer用于开放事件发现，Grounder通过有限状态机约束解码对齐任务指令，LLM-Judge验证结果。

Result: 在五个领域的六个数据集上，DiCoRe平均F1分数比最佳基线高4-7%。

Conclusion: DiCoRe是一个强大的零样本事件检测框架，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Zero-shot Event Detection (ED), the task of identifying event mentions in
natural language text without any training data, is critical for document
understanding in specialized domains. Understanding the complex event ontology,
extracting domain-specific triggers from the passage, and structuring them
appropriately overloads and limits the utility of Large Language Models (LLMs)
for zero-shot ED. To this end, we propose DiCoRe, a divergent-convergent
reasoning framework that decouples the task of ED using Dreamer and Grounder.
Dreamer encourages divergent reasoning through open-ended event discovery,
which helps to boost event coverage. Conversely, Grounder introduces convergent
reasoning to align the free-form predictions with the task-specific
instructions using finite-state machine guided constrained decoding.
Additionally, an LLM-Judge verifies the final outputs to ensure high precision.
Through extensive experiments on six datasets across five domains and nine
LLMs, we demonstrate how DiCoRe consistently outperforms prior zero-shot,
transfer-learning, and reasoning baselines, achieving 4-7% average F1 gains
over the best baseline -- establishing DiCoRe as a strong zero-shot ED
framework.

Motivation: 探讨神经语言模型的归纳偏置是否与人类处理约束一致，需要一种定量方法来研究这些偏置的性质。

Method: 提出m-local熵作为信息论度量，通过实验在扰动自然语言语料库和PFSA定义的语言上验证。

Result: 高m-local熵的语言对Transformer和LSTM更难学习，表明模型对局部统计结构敏感。

Conclusion: 神经语言模型的归纳偏置与人类类似，对语言的局部统计结构高度敏感。

Abstract: Inductive biases are inherent in every machine learning system, shaping how
models generalize from finite data. In the case of neural language models
(LMs), debates persist as to whether these biases align with or diverge from
human processing constraints. To address this issue, we propose a quantitative
framework that allows for controlled investigations into the nature of these
biases. Within our framework, we introduce $m$-local entropy$\unicode{x2013}$an
information-theoretic measure derived from average lossy-context
surprisal$\unicode{x2013}$that captures the local uncertainty of a language by
quantifying how effectively the $m-1$ preceding symbols disambiguate the next
symbol. In experiments on both perturbed natural language corpora and languages
defined by probabilistic finite-state automata (PFSAs), we show that languages
with higher $m$-local entropy are more difficult for Transformer and LSTM LMs
to learn. These results suggest that neural LMs, much like humans, are highly
sensitive to the local statistical structure of a language.

Method: 通过词汇投影技术分析三种先进LALMs，追踪属性信息在层和标记位置的演变。

Result: 发现属性信息在识别失败时随层深减少，早期层解析属性与准确性正相关，且LALMs依赖查询输入而非隐藏状态聚合信息。

Conclusion: 研究结果为听觉属性处理提供了新见解，并为未来改进LALMs奠定了基础。

Abstract: Understanding the internal mechanisms of large audio-language models (LALMs)
is crucial for interpreting their behavior and improving performance. This work
presents the first in-depth analysis of how LALMs internally perceive and
recognize auditory attributes. By applying vocabulary projection on three
state-of-the-art LALMs, we track how attribute information evolves across
layers and token positions. We find that attribute information generally
decreases with layer depth when recognition fails, and that resolving
attributes at earlier layers correlates with better accuracy. Moreover, LALMs
heavily rely on querying auditory inputs for predicting attributes instead of
aggregating necessary information in hidden states at attribute-mentioning
positions. Based on our findings, we demonstrate a method to enhance LALMs. Our
results offer insights into auditory attribute processing, paving the way for
future improvements.

*Diege Sun,Guanyi Chen,Fan Zhao,Xiaorong Cheng,Tingting He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs作为自动评估器在自然语言生成中应用广泛，但其是否能准确复现人类对错误严重性的判断尚不明确。研究发现，人类对不同错误类型（如年龄、性别、服装类型和颜色）的严重性评估存在差异，而LLMs（除Doubao和DeepSeek-V3外）未能完全复现人类判断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs是否能准确复现人类对语义错误严重性的判断，尤其是在多模态（文本+图像）和单模态（仅文本）设置下的表现。

Method: 扩展van Miltenburg等人的实验框架，评估四种错误类型（年龄、性别、服装类型和颜色）在单模态和多模态设置下的表现。

Result: 人类对不同错误类型的严重性评估存在差异，视觉上下文显著影响颜色和类型错误的严重性感知。大多数LLMs对性别错误评分低，但对颜色错误评分高，与人类判断不符。Doubao部分复现人类判断，而DeepSeek-V3在单模态和多模态条件下均表现最佳。

Conclusion: LLMs在复现人类对错误严重性的判断上存在局限性，尤其是缺乏对颜色错误的感知基础。DeepSeek-V3表现出色，但仍有改进空间。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as automated evaluators in
natural language generation, yet it remains unclear whether they can accurately
replicate human judgments of error severity. In this study, we systematically
compare human and LLM assessments of image descriptions containing controlled
semantic errors. We extend the experimental framework of van Miltenburg et al.
(2020) to both unimodal (text-only) and multimodal (text + image) settings,
evaluating four error types: age, gender, clothing type, and clothing colour.
Our findings reveal that humans assign varying levels of severity to different
error types, with visual context significantly amplifying perceived severity
for colour and type errors. Notably, most LLMs assign low scores to gender
errors but disproportionately high scores to colour errors, unlike humans, who
judge both as highly severe but for different reasons. This suggests that these
models may have internalised social norms influencing gender judgments but lack
the perceptual grounding to emulate human sensitivity to colour, which is
shaped by distinct neural mechanisms. Only one of the evaluated LLMs, Doubao,
replicates the human-like ranking of error severity, but it fails to
distinguish between error types as clearly as humans. Surprisingly,
DeepSeek-V3, a unimodal LLM, achieves the highest alignment with human
judgments across both unimodal and multimodal conditions, outperforming even
state-of-the-art multimodal models.

Motivation: 当前RAG系统过度依赖检索上下文，可能导致依赖不准确信息或忽视模型固有知识，尤其在处理误导或冗余信息时。

Method: 提出Knowledgeable-r1，采用联合采样和多策略分布探索，激发大语言模型对参数化与上下文知识的自我整合利用。

Result: 实验表明，Knowledgeable-r1在参数与上下文冲突任务及一般RAG任务中显著提升鲁棒性和推理准确性，尤其在反事实场景中优于基线17.07%。

Conclusion: Knowledgeable-r1有效解决了RAG中知识使用不平衡问题，并在多种任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a mainstream method for improving
performance on knowledge-intensive tasks. However,current RAG systems often
place too much emphasis on retrieved contexts. This can lead to reliance on
inaccurate sources and overlook the model's inherent knowledge, especially when
dealing with misleading or excessive information. To resolve this imbalance, we
propose Knowledgeable-r1 that using joint sampling and define multi policy
distributions in knowledge capability exploration to stimulate large language
models'self-integrated utilization of parametric and contextual knowledge.
Experiments show that Knowledgeable-r1 significantly enhances robustness and
reasoning accuracy in both parameters and contextual conflict tasks and general
RAG tasks, especially outperforming baselines by 17.07% in counterfactual
scenarios and demonstrating consistent gains across RAG tasks. Our code are

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）因训练数据常表现出社会、人口和性别偏见，研究旨在揭示这些偏见在模型中的结构表征。

Method: 通过机制可解释性方法，分析模型内部边缘，评估偏见组件的稳定性、定位和泛化性，并进行系统性消融实验。

Result: 偏见计算集中在少数层，且组件随微调设置变化；移除偏见组件会减少偏见输出，但也影响其他NLP任务。

Conclusion: 偏见在模型中高度局部化，且与其他任务共享重要组件，移除偏见需权衡对其他任务的影响。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to exhibit social, demographic, and
gender biases, often as a consequence of the data on which they are trained. In
this work, we adopt a mechanistic interpretability approach to analyze how such
biases are structurally represented within models such as GPT-2 and Llama2.
Focusing on demographic and gender biases, we explore different metrics to
identify the internal edges responsible for biased behavior. We then assess the
stability, localization, and generalizability of these components across
dataset and linguistic variations. Through systematic ablations, we demonstrate
that bias-related computations are highly localized, often concentrated in a
small subset of layers. Moreover, the identified components change across
fine-tuning settings, including those unrelated to bias. Finally, we show that
removing these components not only reduces biased outputs but also affects
other NLP tasks, such as named entity recognition and linguistic acceptability
judgment because of the sharing of important components with these tasks.

Result: 实验表明ECoRAG在ODQA任务中优于现有压缩方法，且成本更低。

Conclusion: ECoRAG显著提升LLM性能，同时优化了延迟和令牌使用。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in Open-Domain
Question Answering (ODQA) by leveraging external documents through
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). To reduce RAG overhead, from longer
context, context compression is necessary. However, prior compression methods
do not focus on filtering out non-evidential information, which limit the
performance in LLM-based RAG. We thus propose Evidentiality-guided RAG, or
\textbf{ECoRAG} framework. ECoRAG improves LLM performance by compressing
retrieved documents based on evidentiality, ensuring whether answer generation
is supported by the correct evidence. As an additional step, ECoRAG reflects
whether the compressed content provides sufficient evidence, and if not,
retrieves more until sufficient. Experiments show that ECoRAG improves LLM
performance on ODQA tasks, outperforming existing compression methods.
Furthermore, ECoRAG is highly cost-efficient, as it not only reduces latency
but also minimizes token usage by retaining only the necessary information to
generate the correct answer. Code is available at

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the Qwen3 Embedding series, a significant
advancement over its predecessor, the GTE-Qwen series, in text embedding and
reranking capabilities, built upon the Qwen3 foundation models. Leveraging the
Qwen3 LLMs' robust capabilities in multilingual text understanding and
generation, our innovative multi-stage training pipeline combines large-scale
unsupervised pre-training with supervised fine-tuning on high-quality datasets.
Effective model merging strategies further ensure the robustness and
adaptability of the Qwen3 Embedding series. During the training process, the
Qwen3 LLMs serve not only as backbone models but also play a crucial role in
synthesizing high-quality, rich, and diverse training data across multiple

Embedding series offers a spectrum of model sizes (0.6B, 4B, 8B) for both

users can optimize for either efficiency or effectiveness. Empirical
evaluations demonstrate that the Qwen3 Embedding series achieves
state-of-the-art results across diverse benchmarks. Notably, it excels on the
multilingual evaluation benchmark MTEB for text embedding, as well as in
various retrieval tasks, including code retrieval, cross-lingual retrieval and

Abstract: Large-scale neural language models (LMs) exhibit remarkable performance in
in-context learning: the ability to learn and reason the input context on the
fly without parameter update. This work studies in-context counterfactual
reasoning in language models, that is, to predict the consequences of changes
under hypothetical scenarios. We focus on studying a well-defined synthetic
setup: a linear regression task that requires noise abduction, where accurate
prediction is based on inferring and copying the contextual noise from factual
observations. We show that language models are capable of counterfactual
reasoning in this controlled setup and provide insights that counterfactual
reasoning for a broad class of functions can be reduced to a transformation on
in-context observations; we find self-attention, model depth, and data
diversity in pre-training drive performance in Transformers. More
interestingly, our findings extend beyond regression tasks and show that
Transformers can perform noise abduction on sequential data, providing
preliminary evidence on the potential for counterfactual story generation. Our

Result: LLMs的准确性可通过语法和示例字符串的复杂度预测，复杂语法下表现接近随机水平。

Conclusion: LLMs在复杂指令任务中倾向于依赖浅层启发式方法，而非遵循复杂指令。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to perform tasks based
only on a specification of the task provided in context, without examples of
inputs and outputs; this ability is referred to as instruction following. We
introduce the Recognition of Languages In-Context (RELIC) framework to evaluate
instruction following using language recognition: the task of determining if a
string is generated by formal grammar. Unlike many standard evaluations of
LLMs' ability to use their context, this task requires composing together a
large number of instructions (grammar productions) retrieved from the context.
Because the languages are synthetic, the task can be increased in complexity as
LLMs' skills improve, and new instances can be automatically generated,
mitigating data contamination. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on RELIC and
find that their accuracy can be reliably predicted from the complexity of the
grammar and the individual example strings, and that even the most advanced
LLMs currently available show near-chance performance on more complex grammars
and samples, in line with theoretical expectations. We also use RELIC to
diagnose how LLMs attempt to solve increasingly difficult reasoning tasks,
finding that as the complexity of the language recognition task increases,
models switch to relying on shallow heuristics instead of following complex
instructions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs训练中未经授权文本使用的知识产权和伦理问题，同时提供高质量、大规模的公开授权数据集。

Method: 收集、整理并发布Common Pile v0.1数据集，包含30个来源的多样化内容。训练两个7B参数的LLMs（Comma v0.1-1T和Comma v0.1-2T）验证数据集效果。

Result: Comma v0.1模型在性能上与未经授权文本训练的模型（如Llama 1和2 7B）相当。

Conclusion: Common Pile v0.1为LLMs训练提供了可行的公开授权替代方案，并开源了数据集、代码和模型检查点。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained on enormous quantities of
unlicensed text, a practice that has led to scrutiny due to possible
intellectual property infringement and ethical concerns. Training LLMs on
openly licensed text presents a first step towards addressing these issues, but
prior data collection efforts have yielded datasets too small or low-quality to
produce performant LLMs. To address this gap, we collect, curate, and release
the Common Pile v0.1, an eight terabyte collection of openly licensed text
designed for LLM pretraining. The Common Pile comprises content from 30 sources
that span diverse domains including research papers, code, books,
encyclopedias, educational materials, audio transcripts, and more. Crucially,
we validate our efforts by training two 7 billion parameter LLMs on text from
the Common Pile: Comma v0.1-1T and Comma v0.1-2T, trained on 1 and 2 trillion
tokens respectively. Both models attain competitive performance to LLMs trained
on unlicensed text with similar computational budgets, such as Llama 1 and 2
7B. In addition to releasing the Common Pile v0.1 itself, we also release the
code used in its creation as well as the training mixture and checkpoints for
the Comma v0.1 models.

*Adam Wiemerslage,Katharina von der Wense*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了自监督辅助任务在极低资源环境下对形态屈折（字符级任务）的有效性，发现自动编码在小数据时表现最佳，而字符掩码语言模型（CMLM）在数据增加时更有效。基于已知语素边界的掩码采样能持续提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索自监督任务在低资源语言字符级任务（如形态屈折）中的应用潜力，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 使用编码器-解码器Transformer模型，在19种语言和13种辅助目标上测试自监督任务（如自动编码和CMLM）的效果。

Result: 自动编码在数据极少时表现最好，CMLM在数据增加时更有效；基于语素边界的掩码采样能持续提升性能。

Conclusion: 自监督任务在低资源形态建模中具有潜力，尤其是结合语素边界信息的CMLM表现突出。

Abstract: Self-supervised objectives have driven major advances in NLP by leveraging
large-scale unlabeled data, but such resources are scarce for many of the
world's languages. Surprisingly, they have not been explored much for
character-level tasks, where smaller amounts of data have the potential to be
beneficial. We investigate the effectiveness of self-supervised auxiliary tasks
for morphological inflection -- a character-level task highly relevant for
language documentation -- in extremely low-resource settings, training
encoder-decoder transformers for 19 languages and 13 auxiliary objectives.
Autoencoding yields the best performance when unlabeled data is very limited,
while character masked language modeling (CMLM) becomes more effective as data
availability increases. Though objectives with stronger inductive biases
influence model predictions intuitively, they rarely outperform standard CMLM.
However, sampling masks based on known morpheme boundaries consistently
improves performance, highlighting a promising direction for low-resource
morphological modeling.

*Ratna Kandala,Prakash Mondal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一表示自然语言连续与不连续结构的系统，结合了短语结构语法、依存语法和范畴语法的特点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决不同语法形式对不连续结构分析的非收敛性问题。

Method: 结合短语结构语法（PSG）的构成性、依存语法（DG）的头依赖关系和范畴语法（CG）的功能-论元关系，提出统一的数学推导方法。

Result: 展示了连续与不连续结构可通过统一系统分析。

Conclusion: 证明了三种语法形式可以统一用于分析语言结构，为不连续结构提供了新的理论框架。

Abstract: Syntactic discontinuity is a grammatical phenomenon in which a constituent is
split into more than one part because of the insertion of an element which is
not part of the constituent. This is observed in many languages across the
world such as Turkish, Russian, Japanese, Warlpiri, Navajo, Hopi, Dyirbal,
Yidiny etc. Different formalisms/frameworks in current linguistic theory
approach the problem of discontinuous structures in different ways. Each
framework/formalism has widely been viewed as an independent and non-converging
system of analysis. In this paper, we propose a unified system of
representation for both continuity and discontinuity in structures of natural
languages by taking into account three formalisms, in particular, Phrase
Structure Grammar (PSG) for its widely used notion of constituency, Dependency
Grammar (DG) for its head-dependent relations, and Categorial Grammar (CG) for
its focus on functor-argument relations. We attempt to show that discontinuous
expressions as well as continuous structures can be analysed through a unified
mathematical derivation incorporating the representations of linguistic
structure in these three grammar formalisms.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种系统化的推理方法，通过分解文本、子声明归因和聚合分类来提高幻觉检测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自然语言推理（NLI）方法在幻觉检测中表现有限，需要更精细的推理过程以提高准确性。

Method: 提出三步推理框架：声明分解、子声明归因与蕴含分类、聚合分类，并引入中间步骤质量评估指标。

Result: 实验表明，系统化推理显著提升了幻觉检测的性能。

Conclusion: 通过引导模型进行更精细的推理，可以有效提高幻觉检测的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: A common approach to hallucination detection casts it as a natural language
inference (NLI) task, often using LLMs to classify whether the generated text
is entailed by corresponding reference texts. Since entailment classification
is a complex reasoning task, one would expect that LLMs could benefit from
generating an explicit reasoning process, as in CoT reasoning or the explicit
``thinking'' of recent reasoning models. In this work, we propose that guiding
such models to perform a systematic and comprehensive reasoning process -- one
that both decomposes the text into smaller facts and also finds evidence in the
source for each fact -- allows models to execute much finer-grained and
accurate entailment decisions, leading to increased performance. To that end,
we define a 3-step reasoning process, consisting of (i) claim decomposition,
(ii) sub-claim attribution and entailment classification, and (iii) aggregated
classification, showing that such guided reasoning indeed yields improved
hallucination detection. Following this reasoning framework, we introduce an
analysis scheme, consisting of several metrics that measure the quality of the
intermediate reasoning steps, which provided additional empirical evidence for
the improved quality of our guided reasoning scheme.

TL;DR: 论文提出了Micro-Act框架，通过分层动作空间解决RAG系统中的知识冲突问题，显著提升了问答任务的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG系统中外部检索知识与LLM固有知识冲突的问题影响了问答任务的性能，现有方法难以有效解决。

Method: 提出Micro-Act框架，通过感知上下文复杂性并分解知识源为细粒度比较，以可操作步骤进行推理。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上，Micro-Act显著优于现有方法，尤其在时间和语义冲突类型上表现突出。

Conclusion: Micro-Act不仅能有效解决知识冲突，还在非冲突问题上表现稳健，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems commonly suffer from Knowledge
Conflicts, where retrieved external knowledge contradicts the inherent,
parametric knowledge of large language models (LLMs). It adversely affects
performance on downstream tasks such as question answering (QA). Existing
approaches often attempt to mitigate conflicts by directly comparing two
knowledge sources in a side-by-side manner, but this can overwhelm LLMs with
extraneous or lengthy contexts, ultimately hindering their ability to identify
and mitigate inconsistencies. To address this issue, we propose Micro-Act a
framework with a hierarchical action space that automatically perceives context
complexity and adaptively decomposes each knowledge source into a sequence of
fine-grained comparisons. These comparisons are represented as actionable
steps, enabling reasoning beyond the superficial context. Through extensive
experiments on five benchmark datasets, Micro-Act consistently achieves
significant increase in QA accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines across all
5 datasets and 3 conflict types, especially in temporal and semantic types
where all baselines fail significantly. More importantly, Micro-Act exhibits
robust performance on non-conflict questions simultaneously, highlighting its
practical value in real-world RAG applications.

TL;DR: ProRefine是一种创新的推理时提示优化方法，通过动态优化提示提升多智能体协作任务的性能，显著优于零-shot Chain-of-Thought基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体协作工作流中，由于提示设计不佳导致错误传播和性能不佳，限制了系统的可靠性和可扩展性。

Method: ProRefine利用大型语言模型的文本反馈，动态优化多步推理任务的提示，无需额外训练或真实标签。

Result: 在五个数学推理基准数据集上，ProRefine比零-shot Chain-of-Thought基线提升3到37个百分点。

Conclusion: ProRefine不仅提高准确性，还能让小模型匹配大模型的性能，具有高效、可扩展和普及高性能AI的潜力。

Abstract: Agentic workflows, where multiple AI agents collaborate to accomplish complex
tasks like reasoning or planning, are becoming increasingly prevalent. However,
these workflows often suffer from error propagation and sub-optimal
performance, largely due to poorly designed prompts that fail to effectively
guide individual agents. This is a critical problem because it limits the
reliability and scalability of these powerful systems. We introduce ProRefine,
an innovative inference-time prompt optimization method that leverages textual
feedback from large language models (LLMs) to address this challenge. ProRefine
dynamically refines prompts for multi-step reasoning tasks without additional
training or ground truth labels. Evaluated on five benchmark mathematical
reasoning datasets, ProRefine significantly surpasses zero-shot
Chain-of-Thought baselines by 3 to 37 percentage points. This approach not only
boosts accuracy but also allows smaller models to match the performance of
larger ones, highlighting its potential for efficient and scalable AI
deployment, and democratizing access to high-performing AI.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的LLM遗忘方法，通过约束优化和新型损失函数，有效解决了现有方法在遗忘敏感信息时的不稳定性和性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实中的LLM需要遗忘敏感、过时或专有信息，但现有方法在遗忘和保留之间难以平衡，导致优化不稳定和性能下降。

Method: 将LLM遗忘问题建模为约束优化，使用新型的logit-margin flattening损失函数，并通过原始-对偶算法求解。

Result: 在TOFU和MUSE基准测试中，该方法优于现有基线，能有效移除目标信息并保留下游性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM遗忘提供了一种高效、稳定的解决方案，优于现有技术。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deployed in real-world settings increasingly
face the need to unlearn sensitive, outdated, or proprietary information.
Existing unlearning methods typically formulate forgetting and retention as a
regularized trade-off, combining both objectives into a single scalarized loss.
This often leads to unstable optimization and degraded performance on retained
data, especially under aggressive forgetting. We propose a new formulation of
LLM unlearning as a constrained optimization problem: forgetting is enforced
via a novel logit-margin flattening loss that explicitly drives the output
distribution toward uniformity on a designated forget set, while retention is
preserved through a hard constraint on a separate retain set. Compared to
entropy-based objectives, our loss is softmax-free, numerically stable, and
maintains non-vanishing gradients, enabling more efficient and robust
optimization. We solve the constrained problem using a scalable primal-dual
algorithm that exposes the trade-off between forgetting and retention through
the dynamics of the dual variable. Evaluations on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks
across diverse LLM architectures demonstrate that our approach consistently
matches or exceeds state-of-the-art baselines, effectively removing targeted
information while preserving downstream utility.

<details>

Motivation: 现有数据集规模小、范围窄，难以全面分析搜索增强语言模型的表现，因此需要构建更全面的数据集。

Method: 通过众包收集24,000对多轮用户交互数据，包含12,000个人类偏好投票，并分析用户偏好与引用行为的关系。

Result: 用户偏好受引用数量影响，即使引用内容不直接支持观点；社区驱动平台更受青睐，静态百科全书来源不一定可靠。搜索增强模型在非搜索环境中表现良好，但在搜索环境中依赖参数知识会显著影响质量。

Conclusion: Search Arena数据集为未来研究提供了支持，揭示了用户偏好与引用行为的关系，并展示了搜索增强模型在不同环境中的表现差异。

Abstract: Search-augmented language models combine web search with Large Language
Models (LLMs) to improve response groundedness and freshness. However,
analyzing these systems remains challenging: existing datasets are limited in
scale and narrow in scope, often constrained to static, single-turn,
fact-checking questions. In this work, we introduce Search Arena, a
crowd-sourced, large-scale, human-preference dataset of over 24,000 paired
multi-turn user interactions with search-augmented LLMs. The dataset spans
diverse intents and languages, and contains full system traces with around
12,000 human preference votes. Our analysis reveals that user preferences are
influenced by the number of citations, even when the cited content does not
directly support the attributed claims, uncovering a gap between perceived and
actual credibility. Furthermore, user preferences vary across cited sources,
revealing that community-driven platforms are generally preferred and static
encyclopedic sources are not always appropriate and reliable. To assess
performance across different settings, we conduct cross-arena analyses by
testing search-augmented LLMs in a general-purpose chat environment and
conventional LLMs in search-intensive settings. We find that web search does
not degrade and may even improve performance in non-search settings; however,
the quality in search settings is significantly affected if solely relying on
the model's parametric knowledge. We open-sourced the dataset to support future
research in this direction. Our dataset and code are available at:

TL;DR: 该论文研究了语言模型在偏好判断中的系统性偏差，提出了一种基于反事实数据增强的方法来减少偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型在偏好判断中存在系统性偏差，过度依赖表面特征（如长度、结构等），导致奖励破解和不可靠的评估。这些偏差源于训练数据中的伪影。

Method: 通过控制反事实对，量化偏好模型对偏差的偏好程度，并提出基于反事实数据增强（CDA）的后训练方法。

Result: 偏好模型在60%以上的情况下偏好偏差放大的回答，且与人类偏好相比存在高误校准（约40%）。CDA方法将平均误校准从39.4%降至32.5%，偏差差异从20.5%降至10.0%。

Conclusion: 针对性的去偏方法（如CDA）能有效构建可靠的偏好模型，同时保持整体性能。

Abstract: Language models serve as proxies for human preference judgements in alignment
and evaluation, yet they exhibit systematic miscalibration, prioritizing
superficial patterns over substantive qualities. This bias manifests as
overreliance on features like length, structure, and style, leading to issues
like reward hacking and unreliable evaluations. Evidence suggests these biases
originate in artifacts in human training data. In this work, we systematically
investigate the relationship between training data biases and preference model
miscalibration across five idiosyncratic features of language model
generations: length, structure, jargon, sycophancy and vagueness. Using
controlled counterfactual pairs, we first quantify the extent to which
preference models favor responses with magnified biases (skew), finding this
preference occurs in >60% of instances, and model preferences show high
miscalibration (~40%) compared to human preferences. Notably, bias features
only show mild negative correlations to human preference labels (mean r_human =
-0.12) but show moderately strong positive correlations with labels from a
strong reward model (mean r_model = +0.36), suggesting that models may overrely
on spurious cues. To mitigate these issues, we propose a simple post-training
method based on counterfactual data augmentation (CDA) using synthesized
contrastive examples. Finetuning models with CDA reduces average miscalibration
from 39.4% to 32.5% and average absolute skew difference from 20.5% to 10.0%,
while maintaining overall RewardBench performance, showing that targeted
debiasing is effective for building reliable preference models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态调整对抗训练扰动预算的方法（DES），通过结合决策边界距离、预测置信度和模型不确定性，显著提升了对抗鲁棒性和标准准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗训练方法依赖固定扰动预算，无法适应实例特定的鲁棒性需求，限制了其效果。

Method: DES框架动态调整每个实例和训练迭代的扰动预算，结合梯度代理、softmax熵和蒙特卡洛dropout估计的三种关键因素。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100上，DES显著优于固定预算和现有自适应方法，提升了对抗鲁棒性和标准准确性。

Conclusion: DES为实例感知和数据驱动的对抗训练开辟了新方向，并提供了理论稳定性与收敛性分析。

Abstract: Adversarial training is among the most effective strategies for defending
deep neural networks against adversarial examples. A key limitation of existing
adversarial training approaches lies in their reliance on a fixed perturbation
budget, which fails to account for instance-specific robustness
characteristics. While prior works such as IAAT and MMA introduce
instance-level adaptations, they often rely on heuristic or static
approximations of data robustness. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Epsilon
Scheduling (DES), a novel framework that adaptively adjusts the adversarial
perturbation budget per instance and per training iteration. DES integrates
three key factors: (1) the distance to the decision boundary approximated via
gradient-based proxies, (2) prediction confidence derived from softmax entropy,
and (3) model uncertainty estimated via Monte Carlo dropout. By combining these
cues into a unified scheduling strategy, DES tailors the perturbation budget
dynamically to guide more effective adversarial learning. Experimental results
on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 show that our method consistently improves both
adversarial robustness and standard accuracy compared to fixed-epsilon
baselines and prior adaptive methods. Moreover, we provide theoretical insights
into the stability and convergence of our scheduling policy. This work opens a
new avenue for instance-aware, data-driven adversarial training methods.

TL;DR: RSVP是一个新颖的框架，通过视觉提示将多模态推理与视觉分割结合，显著提升了多模态大语言模型在视觉定位和分割任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在推理能力上表现优异，但缺乏明确的视觉定位和分割机制，导致认知推理与视觉感知之间存在差距。

Method: RSVP采用两阶段框架：推理阶段通过多模态链式视觉提示生成区域建议；分割阶段通过视觉-语言分割模块（VLSM）结合文本和视觉线索生成精确分割掩码。

Result: 实验表明，RSVP在ReasonSeg上比现有方法高出+6.5 gIoU和+9.2 cIoU，在SegInW的零样本设置下达到49.7 mAP。

Conclusion: RSVP为整合认知推理与结构化视觉理解提供了有效且可扩展的框架。

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
reasoning capability while lack explicit mechanisms for visual grounding and
segmentation, creating a gap between cognitive reasoning and visual perception.
To bridge this gap, we introduce Reasoning Segmentation via Visual Prompting
(RSVP), a novel framework that unifies multi-step multimodal reasoning with
grounded visual understanding. RSVP is a two-stage structuralized framework
that integrates reasoning-driven localization with segmentation refinement. In
the reasoning stage, RSVP employs multimodal chain-of-thought visual prompts to
help MLLMs understand queries and infer targets, generating interpretable
region proposals that enhance visual grounding. In segmentation stage, RSVP
refines these proposals with a Vision-Language Segmentation Module (VLSM),
seamlessly integrates textual and visual cues to produce precise segmentation
masks. By explicitly modelling the interaction between multimodal reasoning and
segmentation, RSVP introduces a new paradigm for interpretable reasoning
segmentation. It exploits MLLMs' inherent localization capabilities, enabling
the models to not only reason about objects but also generate structured visual
representations. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that RSVP achieves
state-of-the-art performance, surpasses state-of-the-art methods by up to +6.5
gIoU and +9.2 cIoU on ReasonSeg, and achieves 49.7 mAP on SegInW under
zero-shot settings. These results validate RSVP as an effective and scalable
framework for integrating cognitive reasoning with structured visual
understanding.

Method: 提出MMRB基准，包含92个子任务，采用GPT-4o生成多解法和CoT式标注，并由专家优化。设计了句子级匹配框架以支持快速评估。

Result: 实验表明开源MLLM在多图像推理任务中表现显著落后于商业MLLM，且多模态奖励模型几乎无法处理多图像奖励排名任务。

Conclusion: MMRB填补了多图像推理评估的空白，揭示了当前开源MLLM和多模态奖励模型在此类任务中的局限性。

Abstract: With enhanced capabilities and widespread applications, Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly required to process and reason over
multiple images simultaneously. However, existing MLLM benchmarks focus either
on single-image visual reasoning or on multi-image understanding tasks with
only final-answer evaluation, leaving the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs over
multi-image inputs largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce the
$\textbf{Multimodal Multi-image Reasoning Benchmark (MMRB)}$, the first
benchmark designed to evaluate structured visual reasoning across multiple
images. MMRB comprises $\textbf{92 sub-tasks}$ covering spatial, temporal, and
semantic reasoning, with multi-solution, CoT-style annotations generated by
GPT-4o and refined by human experts. A derivative subset is designed to
evaluate multimodal reward models in multi-image scenarios. To support fast and
scalable evaluation, we propose a sentence-level matching framework using
open-source LLMs. Extensive baseline experiments on $\textbf{40 MLLMs}$,
including 9 reasoning-specific models and 8 reward models, demonstrate that
open-source MLLMs still lag significantly behind commercial MLLMs in
multi-image reasoning tasks. Furthermore, current multimodal reward models are
nearly incapable of handling multi-image reward ranking tasks.

Conclusion: 提出的弱监督流程有效解决了3D人类生成中的关键挑战，为未来研究提供了代码和数据集支持。

Abstract: 3D human generation is an important problem with a wide range of applications
in computer vision and graphics. Despite recent progress in generative AI such
as diffusion models or rendering methods like Neural Radiance Fields or
Gaussian Splatting, controlling the generation of accurate 3D humans from text
prompts remains an open challenge. Current methods struggle with fine detail,
accurate rendering of hands and faces, human realism, and controlability over
appearance. The lack of diversity, realism, and annotation in human image data
also remains a challenge, hindering the development of a foundational 3D human
model. We present a weakly supervised pipeline that tries to address these
challenges. In the first step, we generate a photorealistic human image dataset
with controllable attributes such as appearance, race, gender, etc using a
state-of-the-art image diffusion model. Next, we propose an efficient mapping
approach from image features to 3D point clouds using a transformer-based
architecture. Finally, we close the loop by training a point-cloud diffusion
model that is conditioned on the same text prompts used to generate the
original samples. We demonstrate orders-of-magnitude speed-ups in 3D human
generation compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, along with
significantly improved text-prompt alignment, realism, and rendering quality.
We will make the code and dataset available.

including MedGemma-4B-it, Qwen2.5-VL, Janus-Pro-7B, and Eagle2-9B. The
best-performing model (MedGemma) achieves 83.24% overall accuracy. To bridge
the gap between AI performance and clinical expertise, we conducted a
comprehensive human reader study involving 3 radiology residents on 200
randomly sampled cases. Our evaluation demonstrates that MedGemma achieved
superior performance (83.84% accuracy) compared to human readers (best
radiology resident: 77.27%), representing a significant milestone where AI
performance exceeds expert human evaluation on chest X-ray interpretation. The
reader study reveals distinct performance patterns between AI models and human
experts, with strong inter-reader agreement among radiologists while showing
more variable agreement patterns between human readers and AI models. ReXVQA
establishes a new standard for evaluating generalist radiological AI systems,
offering public leaderboards, fine-grained evaluation splits, structured

*Delong Chen,Willy Chung,Yejin Bang,Ziwei Ji,Pascale Fung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WorldPrediction是一个基于视频的基准测试，用于评估AI模型的世界建模和程序规划能力，强调具有时间和语义抽象的动作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI模型（尤其是生成模型）如何学习世界模型并进行程序规划尚不明确，需要一个专门的基准测试来评估这些能力。

Method: 通过视觉观察表示状态和动作，提供“动作等价物”以避免低级别连续性线索的干扰，基于部分可观察半MDP框架设计任务。

Result: 前沿模型在WorldPrediction-WM和WorldPrediction-PP上的准确率分别为57%和38%，而人类能完美完成任务。

Conclusion: WorldPrediction为评估AI模型的世界建模和规划能力提供了可靠基准，揭示了当前模型与人类能力的差距。

Abstract: Humans are known to have an internal "world model" that enables us to carry
out action planning based on world states. AI agents need to have such a world
model for action planning as well. It is not clear how current AI models,
especially generative models, are able to learn such world models and carry out
procedural planning in diverse environments. We introduce WorldPrediction, a
video-based benchmark for evaluating world modeling and procedural planning
capabilities of different AI models. In contrast to prior benchmarks that focus
primarily on low-level world modeling and robotic motion planning,
WorldPrediction is the first benchmark that emphasizes actions with temporal
and semantic abstraction. Given initial and final world states, the task is to
distinguish the proper action (WorldPrediction-WM) or the properly ordered
sequence of actions (WorldPrediction-PP) from a set of counterfactual
distractors. This discriminative task setup enable us to evaluate different
types of world models and planners and realize a thorough comparison across
different hypothesis. The benchmark represents states and actions using visual
observations. In order to prevent models from exploiting low-level continuity
cues in background scenes, we provide "action equivalents" - identical actions
observed in different contexts - as candidates for selection. This benchmark is
grounded in a formal framework of partially observable semi-MDP, ensuring
better reliability and robustness of the evaluation. We conduct extensive human
filtering and validation on our benchmark and show that current frontier models
barely achieve 57% accuracy on WorldPrediction-WM and 38% on WorldPrediction-PP
whereas humans are able to solve both tasks perfectly.

TL;DR: PLUCC是一种基于上下文线索的冰球检测方法，利用球员行为作为先验信息，通过多尺度特征提取和门控解码器实现高性能检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冰球在视频中检测困难，传统方法忽略球员行为的上下文线索，而球员的朝向和位置能提供重要信息。

Method: PLUCC包含上下文编码器、特征金字塔编码器和门控解码器，结合球员行为和多尺度特征。

Result: 在PuckDataset上，PLUCC的平均精度提升12.2%，RSLE精度提升25%，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 上下文理解对冰球检测至关重要，为自动化体育分析提供了新思路。

Abstract: Puck detection in ice hockey broadcast videos poses significant challenges
due to the puck's small size, frequent occlusions, motion blur, broadcast
artifacts, and scale inconsistencies due to varying camera zoom and broadcast
camera viewpoints. Prior works focus on appearance-based or motion-based cues
of the puck without explicitly modelling the cues derived from player
behaviour. Players consistently turn their bodies and direct their gaze toward
the puck. Motivated by this strong contextual cue, we propose Puck Localization
Using Contextual Cues (PLUCC), a novel approach for scale-aware and
context-driven single-frame puck detections. PLUCC consists of three
components: (a) a contextual encoder, which utilizes player orientations and
positioning as helpful priors; (b) a feature pyramid encoder, which extracts
multiscale features from the dual encoders; and (c) a gating decoder that
combines latent features with a channel gating mechanism. For evaluation, in
addition to standard average precision, we propose Rink Space Localization
Error (RSLE), a scale-invariant homography-based metric for removing
perspective bias from rink space evaluation. The experimental results of PLUCC
on the PuckDataset dataset demonstrated state-of-the-art detection performance,
surpassing previous baseline methods by an average precision improvement of
12.2% and RSLE average precision of 25%. Our research demonstrates the critical
role of contextual understanding in improving puck detection performance, with
broad implications for automated sports analysis.

*Jubayer Ahmed Bhuiyan Shawon,Hasan Mahmud,Kamrul Hasan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究通过微调视频Transformer架构（VideoMAE、ViViT、TimeSformer）在孟加拉手语数据集（BdSLW60和BdSLW401）上进行手语识别，显著优于传统方法，其中VideoMAE表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高孟加拉手语（BdSL）识别的准确性和可扩展性，以改善听力障碍群体的无障碍沟通。

Method: 使用视频Transformer架构，标准化视频帧率至30 FPS，应用数据增强技术，并通过10折分层交叉验证和独立测试用户评估模型性能。

Result: VideoMAE在BdSLW60上达到95.5%准确率，在BdSLW401上达到81.04%准确率，显著优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 视频Transformer模型在孟加拉手语识别中表现出色，具有可扩展性和高准确性潜力。

Abstract: Sign Language Recognition (SLR) involves the automatic identification and
classification of sign gestures from images or video, converting them into text
or speech to improve accessibility for the hearing-impaired community. In
Bangladesh, Bangla Sign Language (BdSL) serves as the primary mode of
communication for many individuals with hearing impairments. This study
fine-tunes state-of-the-art video transformer architectures -- VideoMAE, ViViT,
and TimeSformer -- on BdSLW60 (arXiv:2402.08635), a small-scale BdSL dataset
with 60 frequent signs. We standardized the videos to 30 FPS, resulting in
9,307 user trial clips. To evaluate scalability and robustness, the models were
also fine-tuned on BdSLW401 (arXiv:2503.02360), a large-scale dataset with 401
sign classes. Additionally, we benchmark performance against public datasets,
including LSA64 and WLASL. Data augmentation techniques such as random
cropping, horizontal flipping, and short-side scaling were applied to improve
model robustness. To ensure balanced evaluation across folds during model
selection, we employed 10-fold stratified cross-validation on the training set,
while signer-independent evaluation was carried out using held-out test data
from unseen users U4 and U8. Results show that video transformer models
significantly outperform traditional machine learning and deep learning
approaches. Performance is influenced by factors such as dataset size, video
quality, frame distribution, frame rate, and model architecture. Among the
models, the VideoMAE variant (MCG-NJU/videomae-base-finetuned-kinetics)
achieved the highest accuracies of 95.5% on the frame rate corrected BdSLW60
dataset and 81.04% on the front-facing signs of BdSLW401 -- demonstrating
strong potential for scalable and accurate BdSL recognition.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种将激活最大化技术应用于基于DNN的脑编码模型的方法，以生成驱动特定脑区反应的图像，并验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管DNN编码模型能预测大脑对视觉刺激的反应，但缺乏对驱动这些反应的具体特征的理解。

Method: 提取并自适应下采样预训练Inception V3网络的激活，使用线性回归预测fMRI反应，并应用激活最大化生成优化图像。

Result: 生成的图像与已知选择性特征定性对应，并能可靠驱动目标脑区活动。

Conclusion: 激活最大化可成功应用于DNN编码模型，为人类视觉系统的响应特征提供了灵活的表征和调制方法。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) trained on visual tasks develop feature
representations that resemble those in the human visual system. Although
DNN-based encoding models can accurately predict brain responses to visual
stimuli, they offer limited insight into the specific features driving these
responses. Here, we demonstrate that activation maximization -- a technique
designed to interpret vision DNNs -- can be applied to DNN-based encoding
models of the human brain. We extract and adaptively downsample activations
from multiple layers of a pretrained Inception V3 network, then use linear
regression to predict fMRI responses. This yields a full image-computable model
of brain responses. Next, we apply activation maximization to generate images
optimized for predicted responses in individual cortical voxels. We find that
these images contain visual characteristics that qualitatively correspond with
known selectivity and enable exploration of selectivity across the visual
cortex. We further extend our method to whole regions of interest (ROIs) of the
brain and validate its efficacy by presenting these images to human
participants in an fMRI study. We find that the generated images reliably drive
activity in targeted regions across both low- and high-level visual areas and
across subjects. These results demonstrate that activation maximization can be
successfully applied to DNN-based encoding models. By addressing key
limitations of alternative approaches that require natively generative models,
our approach enables flexible characterization and modulation of responses
across the human visual system.

TL;DR: 研究发现，现有的基于扰动的图像保护方法无法完全阻止扩散模型对图像的编辑，反而可能增强图像与文本提示的关联性，导致更好的编辑效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型（如Stable Diffusion）可能被滥用传播虚假信息或侵犯版权，因此需要有效的图像保护方法。

Method: 通过实验评估多种基于扰动的图像保护方法在不同领域（自然场景图像和艺术作品）和编辑任务（图像到图像生成和风格编辑）中的效果。

Result: 扰动保护并未完全阻止扩散编辑，反而在某些情况下增强了编辑效果。

Conclusion: 基于扰动的方法不足以提供针对扩散编辑的鲁棒图像保护。

Abstract: The remarkable image generation capabilities of state-of-the-art diffusion
models, such as Stable Diffusion, can also be misused to spread misinformation
and plagiarize copyrighted materials. To mitigate the potential risks
associated with image editing, current image protection methods rely on adding
imperceptible perturbations to images to obstruct diffusion-based editing. A
fully successful protection for an image implies that the output of editing
attempts is an undesirable, noisy image which is completely unrelated to the
reference image. In our experiments with various perturbation-based image
protection methods across multiple domains (natural scene images and artworks)
and editing tasks (image-to-image generation and style editing), we discover
that such protection does not achieve this goal completely. In most scenarios,
diffusion-based editing of protected images generates a desirable output image
which adheres precisely to the guidance prompt. Our findings suggest that
adding noise to images may paradoxically increase their association with given
text prompts during the generation process, leading to unintended consequences
such as better resultant edits. Hence, we argue that perturbation-based methods
may not provide a sufficient solution for robust image protection against
diffusion-based editing.

### [141] [Normalize Filters! Classical Wisdom for Deep Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04401)
*Gustavo Perez,Stella X. Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种滤波器归一化方法，通过可学习的缩放和位移（类似于批归一化）来解决深度学习卷积滤波器缺乏归一化的问题，从而提升模型对大气传输的鲁棒性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像滤波器经过精心归一化以确保一致性和可解释性，而深度学习中的卷积滤波器缺乏此类约束，导致在图像大气传输中产生失真和错误结果。

Method: 提出滤波器归一化方法，结合可学习的缩放和位移，使滤波器具有大气等变性，适用于卷积神经网络和依赖卷积的视觉变换器。

Result: 在人工和自然强度变化基准测试中取得显著改进，ResNet34甚至大幅超越CLIP。

Conclusion: 滤波器归一化不仅提升了性能，还规范了学习过程，促进了滤波器多样性，增强了鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Classical image filters, such as those for averaging or differencing, are
carefully normalized to ensure consistency, interpretability, and to avoid
artifacts like intensity shifts, halos, or ringing. In contrast, convolutional
filters learned end-to-end in deep networks lack such constraints. Although
they may resemble wavelets and blob/edge detectors, they are not normalized in
the same or any way. Consequently, when images undergo atmospheric transfer,
their responses become distorted, leading to incorrect outcomes. We address
this limitation by proposing filter normalization, followed by learnable
scaling and shifting, akin to batch normalization. This simple yet effective
modification ensures that the filters are atmosphere-equivariant, enabling
co-domain symmetry. By integrating classical filtering principles into deep
learning (applicable to both convolutional neural networks and
convolution-dependent vision transformers), our method achieves significant
improvements on artificial and natural intensity variation benchmarks. Our
ResNet34 could even outperform CLIP by a large margin. Our analysis reveals
that unnormalized filters degrade performance, whereas filter normalization
regularizes learning, promotes diversity, and improves robustness and
generalization.

TL;DR: HMAR是一种新的图像生成算法，通过改进VAR的并行生成问题，采用分层掩码自回归建模，提高了图像质量和生成速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VAR在并行生成高分辨率图像时存在质量下降、序列长度超线性增长和采样计划固定的问题，HMAR旨在解决这些问题。

Method: HMAR将下一尺度预测建模为马尔可夫过程，并引入可控的多步掩码生成，同时开发了高效的块稀疏注意力内核。

Result: 在ImageNet 256x256和512x512基准测试中，HMAR表现优于VAR、扩散模型和自回归基线，训练和推理速度分别提高2.5倍和1.75倍。

Conclusion: HMAR不仅提升了图像生成质量和效率，还提供了灵活的采样计划和零样本图像编辑能力。

Abstract: Visual Auto-Regressive modeling (VAR) has shown promise in bridging the speed
and quality gap between autoregressive image models and diffusion models. VAR
reformulates autoregressive modeling by decomposing an image into successive
resolution scales. During inference, an image is generated by predicting all
the tokens in the next (higher-resolution) scale, conditioned on all tokens in
all previous (lower-resolution) scales. However, this formulation suffers from
reduced image quality due to the parallel generation of all tokens in a
resolution scale; has sequence lengths scaling superlinearly in image
resolution; and requires retraining to change the sampling schedule.
  We introduce Hierarchical Masked Auto-Regressive modeling (HMAR), a new image
generation algorithm that alleviates these issues using next-scale prediction
and masked prediction to generate high-quality images with fast sampling. HMAR
reformulates next-scale prediction as a Markovian process, wherein the
prediction of each resolution scale is conditioned only on tokens in its
immediate predecessor instead of the tokens in all predecessor resolutions.
When predicting a resolution scale, HMAR uses a controllable multi-step masked
generation procedure to generate a subset of the tokens in each step. On
ImageNet 256x256 and 512x512 benchmarks, HMAR models match or outperform
parameter-matched VAR, diffusion, and autoregressive baselines. We develop
efficient IO-aware block-sparse attention kernels that allow HMAR to achieve
faster training and inference times over VAR by over 2.5x and 1.75x
respectively, as well as over 3x lower inference memory footprint. Finally,
HMAR yields additional flexibility over VAR; its sampling schedule can be
changed without further training, and it can be applied to image editing tasks
in a zero-shot manner.

Motivation: 现有方法通常假设使用设备视觉-惯性里程计系统的帧率6DoF姿态估计，可能忽略像素级重建所需的关键细节。

Method: 1. 使用VIBA校准滚动快门RGB相机的高频轨迹；2. 将基于高斯泼溅的物理图像形成模型纳入重建流程。

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过精确校准和物理模型显著提升了逼真重建的质量，适用于多种高斯泼溅表示变体。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the challenges associated with using egocentric
devices to photorealistic reconstruct the scene in high dynamic range. Existing
methodologies typically assume using frame-rate 6DoF pose estimated from the
device's visual-inertial odometry system, which may neglect crucial details
necessary for pixel-accurate reconstruction. This study presents two
significant findings. Firstly, in contrast to mainstream work treating RGB
camera as global shutter frame-rate camera, we emphasize the importance of
employing visual-inertial bundle adjustment (VIBA) to calibrate the precise
timestamps and movement of the rolling shutter RGB sensing camera in a high
frequency trajectory format, which ensures an accurate calibration of the
physical properties of the rolling-shutter camera. Secondly, we incorporate a
physical image formation model based into Gaussian Splatting, which effectively
addresses the sensor characteristics, including the rolling-shutter effect of
RGB cameras and the dynamic ranges measured by sensors. Our proposed
formulation is applicable to the widely-used variants of Gaussian Splats
representation. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of our pipeline using the
open-source Project Aria device under diverse indoor and outdoor lighting
conditions, and further validate it on a Meta Quest3 device. Across all
experiments, we observe a consistent visual enhancement of +1 dB in PSNR by
incorporating VIBA, with an additional +1 dB achieved through our proposed
image formation model. Our complete implementation, evaluation datasets, and
recording profile are available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种称为“面部去正面化”的方法，通过增强训练数据集来提高面部特征提取模型的性能，避免了推理时的额外时间开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如面部正面化）在实际应用中不实用，且通常在小规模数据集上评估，难以应对极端头部姿态下的面部识别任务。

Method: 1) 在预处理后的正面-侧面配对数据集上训练FFWM模型；2) 在大规模原始和随机去正面化数据集上基于ArcFace损失训练ResNet-50模型。

Result: 在LFW、AgeDB和CFP数据集上表现优于现有方法，但在Multi-PIE极端姿态（75和90度）上未显著改进。

Conclusion: 当前方法可能对小数据集过拟合，去正面化方法在大规模数据集上更具优势。

Abstract: Face recognition under extreme head poses is a challenging task. Ideally, a
face recognition system should perform well across different head poses, which
is known as pose-invariant face recognition. To achieve pose invariance,
current approaches rely on sophisticated methods, such as face frontalization
and various facial feature extraction model architectures. However, these
methods are somewhat impractical in real-life settings and are typically
evaluated on small scientific datasets, such as Multi-PIE. In this work, we
propose the inverse method of face frontalization, called face
defrontalization, to augment the training dataset of facial feature extraction
model. The method does not introduce any time overhead during the inference
step. The method is composed of: 1) training an adapted face defrontalization
FFWM model on a frontal-profile pairs dataset, which has been preprocessed
using our proposed face alignment method; 2) training a ResNet-50 facial
feature extraction model based on ArcFace loss on a raw and randomly
defrontalized large-scale dataset, where defrontalization was performed with
our previously trained face defrontalization model. Our method was compared
with the existing approaches on four open-access datasets: LFW, AgeDB, CFP, and
Multi-PIE. Defrontalization shows improved results compared to models without
defrontalization, while the proposed adjustments show clear superiority over
the state-of-the-art face frontalization FFWM method on three larger
open-access datasets, but not on the small Multi-PIE dataset for extreme poses
(75 and 90 degrees). The results suggest that at least some of the current
methods may be overfitted to small datasets.

<details>

Motivation: 现有LiDAR 3D检测方法依赖稀疏卷积或Transformer，在资源受限设备上运行困难，FALO旨在解决这一问题。

Method: FALO将稀疏3D体素排列为1D序列，通过ConvDotMix块（大核卷积、Hadamard积和线性层）处理，引入隐式分组优化推理效率。

Result: FALO在nuScenes和Waymo基准测试中表现优异，比最新SOTA方法快1.6~9.8倍。

Conclusion: FALO在检测精度和推理速度上均表现优异，适合资源受限设备部署。

Abstract: Existing LiDAR 3D object detection methods predominantely rely on sparse
convolutions and/or transformers, which can be challenging to run on
resource-constrained edge devices, due to irregular memory access patterns and
high computational costs. In this paper, we propose FALO, a hardware-friendly
approach to LiDAR 3D detection, which offers both state-of-the-art (SOTA)
detection accuracy and fast inference speed. More specifically, given the 3D
point cloud and after voxelization, FALO first arranges sparse 3D voxels into a
1D sequence based on their coordinates and proximity. The sequence is then
processed by our proposed ConvDotMix blocks, consisting of large-kernel
convolutions, Hadamard products, and linear layers. ConvDotMix provides
sufficient mixing capability in both spatial and embedding dimensions, and
introduces higher-order nonlinear interaction among spatial features.
Furthermore, when going through the ConvDotMix layers, we introduce implicit
grouping, which balances the tensor dimensions for more efficient inference and
takes into account the growing receptive field. All these operations are
friendly to run on resource-constrained platforms and proposed FALO can readily
deploy on compact, embedded devices. Our extensive evaluation on LiDAR 3D
detection benchmarks such as nuScenes and Waymo shows that FALO achieves
competitive performance. Meanwhile, FALO is 1.6~9.8x faster than the latest
SOTA on mobile Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) and mobile Neural Processing Unit
(NPU).

Result: 在DFDC和DF40数据集上AUC分别提升6.15%和16.68%，在DDVQA数据集上性能提升24.69%。

Conclusion: AuthGuard通过语言指导和视觉-语言对比学习，实现了更泛化和可解释的深度伪造检测。

Abstract: Existing deepfake detection techniques struggle to keep-up with the
ever-evolving novel, unseen forgeries methods. This limitation stems from their
reliance on statistical artifacts learned during training, which are often tied
to specific generation processes that may not be representative of samples from
new, unseen deepfake generation methods encountered at test time. We propose
that incorporating language guidance can improve deepfake detection
generalization by integrating human-like commonsense reasoning -- such as
recognizing logical inconsistencies and perceptual anomalies -- alongside
statistical cues. To achieve this, we train an expert deepfake vision encoder
by combining discriminative classification with image-text contrastive
learning, where the text is generated by generalist MLLMs using few-shot
prompting. This allows the encoder to extract both language-describable,
commonsense deepfake artifacts and statistical forgery artifacts from
pixel-level distributions. To further enhance robustness, we integrate data
uncertainty learning into vision-language contrastive learning, mitigating
noise in image-text supervision. Our expert vision encoder seamlessly
interfaces with an LLM, further enabling more generalized and interpretable
deepfake detection while also boosting accuracy. The resulting framework,
AuthGuard, achieves state-of-the-art deepfake detection accuracy in both
in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings, achieving AUC gains of 6.15%
on the DFDC dataset and 16.68% on the DF40 dataset. Additionally, AuthGuard
significantly enhances deepfake reasoning, improving performance by 24.69% on
the DDVQA dataset.

Conclusion: 该方法为剪枝领域开辟新方向，显著提升计算效率和模型鲁棒性。

Abstract: Deep learning stands as the modern paradigm for solving cognitive tasks.
However, as the problem complexity increases, models grow deeper and
computationally prohibitive, hindering advancements in real-world and
resource-constrained applications. Extensive studies reveal that pruning
structures in these models efficiently reduces model complexity and improves
computational efficiency. Successful strategies in this sphere include removing
neurons (i.e., filters, heads) or layers, but not both together. Therefore,
simultaneously pruning different structures remains an open problem. To fill
this gap and leverage the benefits of eliminating neurons and layers at once,
we propose a new method capable of pruning different structures within a model
as follows. Given two candidate subnetworks (pruned models), one from layer
pruning and the other from neuron pruning, our method decides which to choose
by selecting the one with the highest representation similarity to its parent
(the network that generates the subnetworks) using the Centered Kernel
Alignment metric. Iteratively repeating this process provides highly sparse
models that preserve the original predictive ability. Throughout extensive
experiments on standard architectures and benchmarks, we confirm the
effectiveness of our approach and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art
layer and filter pruning techniques. At high levels of Floating Point
Operations reduction, most state-of-the-art methods degrade accuracy, whereas
our approach either improves it or experiences only a minimal drop. Notably, on
the popular ResNet56 and ResNet110, we achieve a milestone of 86.37% and 95.82%
FLOPs reduction. Besides, our pruned models obtain robustness to adversarial
and out-of-distribution samples and take an important step towards GreenAI,
reducing carbon emissions by up to 83.31%. Overall, we believe our work opens a
new chapter in pruning.

Abstract: Crack detection on road surfaces is a critical measurement technology in the
instrumentation domain, essential for ensuring infrastructure safety and
transportation reliability. However, due to limited energy and low-resolution
imaging, smart terminal devices struggle to maintain real-time monitoring
performance. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-stage
detection approach for road crack detection, EECD-Net, to enhance accuracy and
energy efficiency of instrumentation. Specifically, the sophisticated
Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (SRCNN) is employed to address
the inherent challenges of low-quality images, which effectively enhance image
resolution while preserving critical structural details. Meanwhile, a Spike
Convolution Unit (SCU) with Continuous Integrate-and-Fire (CIF) neurons is
proposed to convert these images into sparse pulse sequences, significantly
reducing power consumption. Additionally, a Gated Attention Transformer (GAT)
module is designed to strategically fuse multi-scale feature representations
through adaptive attention mechanisms, effectively capturing both long-range
dependencies and intricate local crack patterns, and significantly enhancing
detection robustness across varying crack morphologies. The experiments on the
CrackVision12K benchmark demonstrate that EECD-Net achieves a remarkable 98.6\%
detection accuracy, surpassing state-of-the-art counterparts such as
Hybrid-Segmentor by a significant 1.5\%. Notably, the EECD-Net maintains
exceptional energy efficiency, consuming merely 5.6 mJ, which is a substantial
33\% reduction compared to baseline implementations. This work pioneers a
transformative approach in instrumentation-based crack detection, offering a
scalable, low-power solution for real-time, large-scale infrastructure
monitoring in resource-constrained environments.

*Heng Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为LSKs的即插即用模块，通过可学习的可分离核直接增强图像频率成分，显著减少参数和计算量，同时提升超分辨率性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常通过间接方式（如特殊损失函数）提升单图像超分辨率性能，而LSKs直接从频率角度增强图像质量。

Method: 设计可学习的可分离核（LSKs），将其分解为可合并的一维核，以减少参数和计算量，并通过可视化分析验证其频率增强能力。

Result: 实验表明，LSKs减少60%以上的参数和计算量，同时提升模型性能，尤其在高倍放大时表现更优。

Conclusion: LSKs是一种高效且有效的模块，适用于单图像超分辨率任务，尤其在资源受限和高倍放大的场景中表现突出。

Abstract: Existing approaches often enhance the performance of single-image
super-resolution (SISR) methods by incorporating auxiliary structures, such as
specialized loss functions, to indirectly boost the quality of low-resolution
images. In this paper, we propose a plug-and-play module called Learnable
Separable Kernels (LSKs), which are formally rank-one matrices designed to
directly enhance image frequency components. We begin by explaining why LSKs
are particularly suitable for SISR tasks from a frequency perspective. Baseline
methods incorporating LSKs demonstrate a significant reduction of over 60\% in
both the number of parameters and computational requirements. This reduction is
achieved through the decomposition of LSKs into orthogonal and mergeable
one-dimensional kernels. Additionally, we perform an interpretable analysis of
the feature maps generated by LSKs. Visualization results reveal the capability
of LSKs to enhance image frequency components effectively. Extensive
experiments show that incorporating LSKs not only reduces the number of
parameters and computational load but also improves overall model performance.
Moreover, these experiments demonstrate that models utilizing LSKs exhibit
superior performance, particularly as the upscaling factor increases.

TL;DR: RACRO提出了一种通过强化学习优化视觉提取器的方法，以生成支持下游推理的图像描述，从而在多模态任务中实现高效推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）中视觉与推理解耦时，视觉提取器生成描述不准确的问题。

Method: 采用推理对齐的强化学习策略（RACRO），通过奖励优化视觉提取器的描述生成行为。

Result: 在多模态数学和科学基准测试中，RACRO实现了最佳性能，并支持更高级推理模型的即插即用。

Conclusion: RACRO通过优化视觉提取器，显著提升了多模态推理的效率和性能，避免了昂贵的多模态重新对齐。

Abstract: Recent advances in slow-thinking language models (e.g., OpenAI-o1 and
DeepSeek-R1) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in complex reasoning tasks
by emulating human-like reflective cognition. However, extending such
capabilities to multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) remains challenging
due to the high cost of retraining vision-language alignments when upgrading
the underlying reasoner LLMs. A straightforward solution is to decouple
perception from reasoning, i.e., converting visual inputs into language
representations (e.g., captions) that are then passed to a powerful text-only
reasoner. However, this decoupling introduces a critical challenge: the visual
extractor must generate descriptions that are both faithful to the image and
informative enough to support accurate downstream reasoning. To address this,
we propose Reasoning-Aligned Perceptual Decoupling via Caption Reward
Optimization (RACRO) - a reasoning-guided reinforcement learning strategy that
aligns the extractor's captioning behavior with the reasoning objective. By
closing the perception-reasoning loop via reward-based optimization, RACRO
significantly enhances visual grounding and extracts reasoning-optimized
representations. Experiments on multi-modal math and science benchmarks show
that the proposed RACRO method achieves state-of-the-art average performance
while enabling superior scalability and plug-and-play adaptation to more
advanced reasoning LLMs without the necessity for costly multi-modal
re-alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多分支并行CNN网络在多人体姿态估计中难以捕捉全局上下文且延迟高，需改进。

Method: 设计了轻量级MobileViM Block和LARM模块，结合NPT-Op提取全局信息，并引入SFusion模块整合多尺度信息。

Result: 在COCO和MPII数据集上，参数更少，性能更优且处理速度更快。

Conclusion: LGM-Pose通过单分支结构和创新模块有效解决了现有方法的不足，实现了高效轻量化的姿态估计。

Abstract: Most of the current top-down multi-person pose estimation lightweight methods
are based on multi-branch parallel pure CNN network architecture, which often
struggle to capture the global context required for detecting semantically
complex keypoints and are hindered by high latency due to their intricate and
redundant structures. In this article, an approximate single-branch lightweight
global modeling network (LGM-Pose) is proposed to address these challenges. In
the network, a lightweight MobileViM Block is designed with a proposed
Lightweight Attentional Representation Module (LARM), which integrates
information within and between patches using the Non-Parametric Transformation
Operation(NPT-Op) to extract global information. Additionally, a novel
Shuffle-Integrated Fusion Module (SFusion) is introduced to effectively
integrate multi-scale information, mitigating performance degradation often
observed in single-branch structures. Experimental evaluations on the COCO and
MPII datasets demonstrate that our approach not only reduces the number of
parameters compared to existing mainstream lightweight methods but also
achieves superior performance and faster processing speeds.

Motivation: 解决从单目视频输入生成和编辑4D内容的挑战，同时保持多视角一致性和时间连贯性。

Conclusion: 该框架有效利用基础模型的先验知识，实现了高质量的4D视频生成与编辑，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: We introduce Follow-Your-Creation, a novel 4D video creation framework
capable of both generating and editing 4D content from a single monocular video
input. By leveraging a powerful video inpainting foundation model as a
generative prior, we reformulate 4D video creation as a video inpainting task,
enabling the model to fill in missing content caused by camera trajectory
changes or user edits. To facilitate this, we generate composite masked
inpainting video data to effectively fine-tune the model for 4D video
generation. Given an input video and its associated camera trajectory, we first
perform depth-based point cloud rendering to obtain invisibility masks that
indicate the regions that should be completed. Simultaneously, editing masks
are introduced to specify user-defined modifications, and these are combined
with the invisibility masks to create a composite masks dataset. During
training, we randomly sample different types of masks to construct diverse and
challenging inpainting scenarios, enhancing the model's generalization and
robustness in various 4D editing and generation tasks. To handle temporal
consistency under large camera motion, we design a self-iterative tuning
strategy that gradually increases the viewing angles during training, where the
model is used to generate the next-stage training data after each fine-tuning
iteration. Moreover, we introduce a temporal packaging module during inference
to enhance generation quality. Our method effectively leverages the prior
knowledge of the base model without degrading its original performance,
enabling the generation of 4D videos with consistent multi-view coherence. In
addition, our approach supports prompt-based content editing, demonstrating
strong flexibility and significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods in
both quality and versatility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有持续学习框架忽视高级规划和多级知识学习，需解决这一问题。

Method: HEC将学习分为高低两层，Task-aware MoILE通过聚类视觉文本嵌入和双路由选择LoRA专家，使用SVD保留关键参数。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在减少旧任务遗忘方面优于其他方法。

Conclusion: HEC和Task-aware MoILE能有效支持智能体持续学习新任务同时保留旧知识。

Abstract: Previous continual learning setups for embodied intelligence focused on
executing low-level actions based on human commands, neglecting the ability to
learn high-level planning and multi-level knowledge. To address these issues,
we propose the Hierarchical Embodied Continual Learning Setups (HEC) that
divide the agent's continual learning process into two layers: high-level
instructions and low-level actions, and define five embodied continual learning
sub-setups. Building on these setups, we introduce the Task-aware Mixture of
Incremental LoRA Experts (Task-aware MoILE) method. This approach achieves task
recognition by clustering visual-text embeddings and uses both a task-level
router and a token-level router to select the appropriate LoRA experts. To
effectively address the issue of catastrophic forgetting, we apply Singular
Value Decomposition (SVD) to the LoRA parameters obtained from prior tasks,
preserving key components while orthogonally training the remaining parts. The
experimental results show that our method stands out in reducing the forgetting
of old tasks compared to other methods, effectively supporting agents in
retaining prior knowledge while continuously learning new tasks.

Motivation: 现有扩散方法在3D人体化身生成中难以精确控制身份、体型和动画就绪性，SmartAvatar旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用视觉语言模型的常识推理能力，结合参数化人体生成器，通过自主验证循环（渲染、评估、迭代调整）和自然语言对话实现细化控制。

Result: 生成的化身在网格质量、身份保真度、属性准确性和动画就绪性上优于现有系统，适用于消费级硬件。

Conclusion: SmartAvatar通过交互式AI引导的生成和验证系统，实现了高质量、可定制的3D人体化身生成，适用于动画和交互应用。

Abstract: SmartAvatar is a vision-language-agent-driven framework for generating fully
rigged, animation-ready 3D human avatars from a single photo or textual prompt.
While diffusion-based methods have made progress in general 3D object
generation, they continue to struggle with precise control over human identity,
body shape, and animation readiness. In contrast, SmartAvatar leverages the
commonsense reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (VLMs) in
combination with off-the-shelf parametric human generators to deliver
high-quality, customizable avatars. A key innovation is an autonomous
verification loop, where the agent renders draft avatars, evaluates facial
similarity, anatomical plausibility, and prompt alignment, and iteratively
adjusts generation parameters for convergence. This interactive, AI-guided
refinement process promotes fine-grained control over both facial and body
features, enabling users to iteratively refine their avatars via
natural-language conversations. Unlike diffusion models that rely on static
pre-trained datasets and offer limited flexibility, SmartAvatar brings users
into the modeling loop and ensures continuous improvement through an LLM-driven
procedural generation and verification system. The generated avatars are fully
rigged and support pose manipulation with consistent identity and appearance,
making them suitable for downstream animation and interactive applications.
Quantitative benchmarks and user studies demonstrate that SmartAvatar
outperforms recent text- and image-driven avatar generation systems in terms of
reconstructed mesh quality, identity fidelity, attribute accuracy, and
animation readiness, making it a versatile tool for realistic, customizable
avatar creation on consumer-grade hardware.

Motivation: 解决传感器深度测量中不可靠区域的问题，同时保留几何线索，提升深度图的可靠性和准确性。

Result: 实验证明该方法能生成密集、无伪影的深度图，适用于多种真实场景。

Conclusion: 该框架为传感器深度增强设定了新基准，适用于自动驾驶、机器人和沉浸式技术等领域。

Abstract: We propose a novel two-stage framework for sensor depth enhancement, called
Perfecting Depth. This framework leverages the stochastic nature of diffusion
models to automatically detect unreliable depth regions while preserving
geometric cues. In the first stage (stochastic estimation), the method
identifies unreliable measurements and infers geometric structure by leveraging
a training-inference domain gap. In the second stage (deterministic
refinement), it enforces structural consistency and pixel-level accuracy using
the uncertainty map derived from the first stage. By combining stochastic
uncertainty modeling with deterministic refinement, our method yields dense,
artifact-free depth maps with improved reliability. Experimental results
demonstrate its effectiveness across diverse real-world scenarios. Furthermore,
theoretical analysis, various experiments, and qualitative visualizations
validate its robustness and scalability. Our framework sets a new baseline for
sensor depth enhancement, with potential applications in autonomous driving,
robotics, and immersive technologies.

Conclusion: 深度学习为图像匹配带来了显著进步，但仍存在挑战，未来研究应关注进一步创新方向。

Abstract: Image matching, which establishes correspondences between two-view images to
recover 3D structure and camera geometry, serves as a cornerstone in computer
vision and underpins a wide range of applications, including visual
localization, 3D reconstruction, and simultaneous localization and mapping
(SLAM). Traditional pipelines composed of ``detector-descriptor, feature
matcher, outlier filter, and geometric estimator'' falter in challenging
scenarios. Recent deep-learning advances have significantly boosted both
robustness and accuracy. This survey adopts a unique perspective by
comprehensively reviewing how deep learning has incrementally transformed the
classical image matching pipeline. Our taxonomy highly aligns with the
traditional pipeline in two key aspects: i) the replacement of individual steps
in the traditional pipeline with learnable alternatives, including learnable
detector-descriptor, outlier filter, and geometric estimator; and ii) the
merging of multiple steps into end-to-end learnable modules, encompassing
middle-end sparse matcher, end-to-end semi-dense/dense matcher, and pose
regressor. We first examine the design principles, advantages, and limitations
of both aspects, and then benchmark representative methods on relative pose
recovery, homography estimation, and visual localization tasks. Finally, we
discuss open challenges and outline promising directions for future research.
By systematically categorizing and evaluating deep learning-driven strategies,
this survey offers a clear overview of the evolving image matching landscape
and highlights key avenues for further innovation.

Motivation: 现有AI基准主要关注语言推理，忽视了非语言、多步视觉模拟的复杂性，因此需要STARE来填补这一空白。

Method: STARE包含4K个任务，涵盖几何变换、空间推理和实际应用场景，通过评估模型表现来验证其视觉模拟能力。

Result: 模型在简单2D任务中表现良好，但在复杂3D任务（如立方体展开和七巧板）中表现接近随机。人类表现优异但耗时较长，而模型对视觉模拟的利用不一致。

Conclusion: STARE揭示了模型在复杂视觉模拟任务中的局限性，表明当前模型尚未有效利用中间视觉信息，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Spatial cognition is essential for human intelligence, enabling
problem-solving through visual simulations rather than solely relying on verbal
reasoning. However, existing AI benchmarks primarily assess verbal reasoning,
neglecting the complexities of non-verbal, multi-step visual simulation. We
introduce STARE(Spatial Transformations and Reasoning Evaluation), a benchmark
designed to rigorously evaluate multimodal large language models on tasks
better solved through multi-step visual simulation. STARE features 4K tasks
spanning foundational geometric transformations (2D and 3D), integrated spatial
reasoning (cube net folding and tangram puzzles), and real-world spatial
reasoning (perspective and temporal reasoning), reflecting practical cognitive
challenges like object assembly, mechanical diagram interpretation, and
everyday spatial navigation. Our evaluations show that models excel at
reasoning over simpler 2D transformations, but perform close to random chance
on more complex tasks like 3D cube net folding and tangram puzzles that require
multi-step visual simulations. Humans achieve near-perfect accuracy but take
considerable time (up to 28.9s) on complex tasks, significantly speeding up
(down by 7.5 seconds on average) with intermediate visual simulations. In
contrast, models exhibit inconsistent performance gains from visual
simulations, improving on most tasks but declining in specific cases like
tangram puzzles (GPT-4o, o1) and cube net folding (Claude-3.5, Gemini-2.0
Flash), indicating that models may not know how to effectively leverage
intermediate visual information.

Motivation: 扩散生成模型推理速度慢且计算需求高，现有训练无关方法结合量化和稀疏化会导致性能下降。

Method: 提出FPSAttention，采用统一的3D分块粒度、去噪步感知策略和硬件友好内核，优化3D双向注意力机制。

Result: 在720p分辨率下，注意力操作内核速度提升7.09倍，端到端视频生成速度提升4.96倍。

Conclusion: FPSAttention在保持生成质量的同时，显著提升了视频生成的效率。

Abstract: Diffusion generative models have become the standard for producing
high-quality, coherent video content, yet their slow inference speeds and high
computational demands hinder practical deployment. Although both quantization
and sparsity can independently accelerate inference while maintaining
generation quality, naively combining these techniques in existing
training-free approaches leads to significant performance degradation due to
the lack of joint optimization.We introduce FPSAttention, a novel
training-aware co-design of FP8 quantization and sparsity for video generation,
with a focus on the 3D bi-directional attention mechanism. Our approach
features three key innovations: 1) A unified 3D tile-wise granularity that
simultaneously supports both quantization and sparsity; 2) A denoising
step-aware strategy that adapts to the noise schedule, addressing the strong
correlation between quantization/sparsity errors and denoising steps; 3) A
native, hardware-friendly kernel that leverages FlashAttention and is
implemented with optimized Hopper architecture features for highly efficient
execution. Trained on Wan2.1's 1.3B and 14B models and evaluated on the VBench
benchmark, FPSAttention achieves a 7.09x kernel speedup for attention
operations and a 4.96x end-to-end speedup for video generation compared to the
BF16 baseline at 720p resolution-without sacrificing generation quality.

Abstract: The main goal of representation learning is to acquire meaningful
representations from real-world sensory inputs without supervision.
Representation learning explains some aspects of human development. Various
neural network (NN) models have been proposed that acquire empirically good
representations. However, the formulation of a good representation has not been
established. We recently proposed a method for categorizing changes between a
pair of sensory inputs. A unique feature of this approach is that
transformations between two sensory inputs are learned to satisfy algebraic
structural constraints. Conventional representation learning often assumes that
disentangled independent feature axes is a good representation; however, we
found that such a representation cannot account for conditional independence.
To overcome this problem, we proposed a new method using group decomposition in
Galois algebra theory. Although this method is promising for defining a more
general representation, it assumes pixel-to-pixel translation without feature
extraction, and can only process low-resolution images with no background,
which prevents real-world application. In this study, we provide a simple
method to apply our group decomposition theory to a more realistic scenario by
combining feature extraction and object segmentation. We replace pixel
translation with feature translation and formulate object segmentation as
grouping features under the same transformation. We validated the proposed
method on a practical dataset containing both real-world object and background.
We believe that our model will lead to a better understanding of human
development of object recognition in the real world.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种Few-Shot Prototypical Concept Classification (FSPCC)框架，通过参数高效适应和多层次特征融合，解决了数据稀缺场景下自解释模型（SEMs）的性能问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自解释模型（SEMs）在数据稀缺场景下表现不佳，主要由于参数不平衡和表示错位问题。

Method: 采用Mixture of LoRA Experts (MoLE)实现参数高效适应，结合跨模块概念指导和多层次特征保留策略，并通过几何感知概念判别损失增强可解释性。

Result: 在六个基准测试中，FSPCC显著优于现有SEMs，5-way 5-shot分类任务中相对提升4.2%-8.7%。

Conclusion: 结合概念学习和少样本适应，FSPCC在提升准确性和模型可解释性方面表现出色，为透明视觉识别系统提供了新方向。

Abstract: Self-Explainable Models (SEMs) rely on Prototypical Concept Learning (PCL) to
enable their visual recognition processes more interpretable, but they often
struggle in data-scarce settings where insufficient training samples lead to
suboptimal performance.To address this limitation, we propose a Few-Shot
Prototypical Concept Classification (FSPCC) framework that systematically
mitigates two key challenges under low-data regimes: parametric imbalance and
representation misalignment. Specifically, our approach leverages a Mixture of
LoRA Experts (MoLE) for parameter-efficient adaptation, ensuring a balanced
allocation of trainable parameters between the backbone and the PCL
module.Meanwhile, cross-module concept guidance enforces tight alignment
between the backbone's feature representations and the prototypical concept
activation patterns.In addition, we incorporate a multi-level feature
preservation strategy that fuses spatial and semantic cues across various
layers, thereby enriching the learned representations and mitigating the
challenges posed by limited data availability.Finally, to enhance
interpretability and minimize concept overlap, we introduce a geometry-aware
concept discrimination loss that enforces orthogonality among concepts,
encouraging more disentangled and transparent decision boundaries.Experimental
results on six popular benchmarks (CUB-200-2011, mini-ImageNet, CIFAR-FS,
Stanford Cars, FGVC-Aircraft, and DTD) demonstrate that our approach
consistently outperforms existing SEMs by a notable margin, with 4.2%-8.7%
relative gains in 5-way 5-shot classification.These findings highlight the
efficacy of coupling concept learning with few-shot adaptation to achieve both
higher accuracy and clearer model interpretability, paving the way for more
transparent visual recognition systems.

TL;DR: Gen-n-Val是一个新型数据生成框架，结合LD、LLMs和VLLMs，通过优化提示和验证机制生成高质量合成数据，显著提升目标检测和实例分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决计算机视觉任务中数据稀缺和标签噪声问题，当前合成数据方法存在多对象掩码、分割不准确和类别标签错误等缺陷。

Method: Gen-n-Val框架包含两个代理：LD提示代理（LLM）优化提示生成高质量单对象数据；数据验证代理（VLLM）过滤低质量数据。通过TextGrad优化系统提示，并利用图像协调技术组合多实例场景。

Result: 将无效合成数据从50%降至7%，在COCO实例分割中罕见类别的mAP提升1%，在开放词汇目标检测中mAP提升7.1%。

Conclusion: Gen-n-Val显著提升了目标检测和实例分割的性能，为合成数据生成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Large Language Models
(VLLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance as agents across various tasks
while data scarcity and label noise remain significant challenges in computer
vision tasks, such as object detection and instance segmentation. A common
solution for resolving these issues is to generate synthetic data. However,
current synthetic data generation methods struggle with issues, such as
multiple objects per mask, inaccurate segmentation, and incorrect category
labels, limiting their effectiveness. To address these issues, we introduce
Gen-n-Val, a novel agentic data generation framework that leverages Layer
Diffusion (LD), LLMs, and VLLMs to produce high-quality, single-object masks
and diverse backgrounds. Gen-n-Val consists of two agents: (1) The LD prompt
agent, an LLM, optimizes prompts for LD to generate high-quality foreground
instance images and segmentation masks. These optimized prompts ensure the
generation of single-object synthetic data with precise instance masks and
clean backgrounds. (2) The data validation agent, a VLLM, which filters out
low-quality synthetic instance images. The system prompts for both agents are
refined through TextGrad. Additionally, we use image harmonization to combine
multiple instances within scenes. Compared to state-of-the-art synthetic data
approaches like MosaicFusion, our approach reduces invalid synthetic data from
50% to 7% and improves performance by 1% mAP on rare classes in COCO instance
segmentation with YOLOv9c and YOLO11m. Furthermore, Gen-n-Val shows significant
improvements (7. 1% mAP) over YOLO-Worldv2-M in open-vocabulary object
detection benchmarks with YOLO11m. Moreover, Gen-n-Val improves the performance
of YOLOv9 and YOLO11 families in instance segmentation and object detection.

*Chuyun Deng,Na Liu,Wei Xie,Lianming Xu,Li Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MARS是一种结合CNN和Transformer的多尺度感知无线电地图超分辨率方法，通过多尺度特征融合和残差连接提升重建精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无线电地图在智能城市和物联网等应用中至关重要，但传统方法缺乏环境感知，深度学习依赖详细场景数据，限制了泛化能力。

Method: 提出MARS方法，结合CNN和Transformer，利用多尺度特征融合和残差连接，提取全局和局部特征。

Result: 在不同场景和天线位置的实验中，MARS在MSE和SSIM上优于基线模型，且计算成本低。

Conclusion: MARS具有强大的实用潜力，能够高效准确地重建无线电地图。

Abstract: Radio maps reflect the spatial distribution of signal strength and are
essential for applications like smart cities, IoT, and wireless network
planning. However, reconstructing accurate radio maps from sparse measurements
remains challenging. Traditional interpolation and inpainting methods lack
environmental awareness, while many deep learning approaches depend on detailed
scene data, limiting generalization. To address this, we propose MARS, a
Multi-scale Aware Radiomap Super-resolution method that combines CNNs and
Transformers with multi-scale feature fusion and residual connections. MARS
focuses on both global and local feature extraction, enhancing feature
representation across different receptive fields and improving reconstruction
accuracy. Experiments across different scenes and antenna locations show that
MARS outperforms baseline models in both MSE and SSIM, while maintaining low
computational cost, demonstrating strong practical potential.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了HoliSafe数据集和SafeLLaVA模型，解决了现有视觉语言模型（VLM）安全性的不足，通过全面覆盖图像-文本组合和引入可学习的安全元标记及专用安全头，显著提升了模型的安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLM安全方法存在两个主要问题：1）数据集和基准测试未全面考虑图像-文本交互可能产生的有害内容；2）方法主要依赖数据调优，缺乏架构创新。

Method: 提出HoliSafe数据集，覆盖五种安全/不安全图像-文本组合；设计SafeLLaVA模型，引入可学习安全元标记和专用安全头。

Result: SafeLLaVA在多个VLM基准测试中达到最先进的安全性能；HoliSafe基准测试揭示了现有模型的关键漏洞。

Conclusion: HoliSafe和SafeLLaVA为VLM安全研究提供了新方向，推动了多模态对齐的进一步发展。

Abstract: Despite emerging efforts to enhance the safety of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), current approaches face two main shortcomings. 1) Existing
safety-tuning datasets and benchmarks only partially consider how image-text
interactions can yield harmful content, often overlooking contextually unsafe
outcomes from seemingly benign pairs. This narrow coverage leaves VLMs
vulnerable to jailbreak attacks in unseen configurations. 2) Prior methods rely
primarily on data-centric tuning, with limited architectural innovations to
intrinsically strengthen safety. We address these gaps by introducing a
holistic safety dataset and benchmark, HoliSafe, that spans all five
safe/unsafe image-text combinations, providing a more robust basis for both
training and evaluation. We further propose SafeLLaVA, a novel VLM augmented
with a learnable safety meta token and a dedicated safety head. The meta token
encodes harmful visual cues during training, intrinsically guiding the language
model toward safer responses, while the safety head offers interpretable
harmfulness classification aligned with refusal rationales. Experiments show
that SafeLLaVA, trained on HoliSafe, achieves state-of-the-art safety
performance across multiple VLM benchmarks. Additionally, the HoliSafe
benchmark itself reveals critical vulnerabilities in existing models. We hope
that HoliSafe and SafeLLaVA will spur further research into robust and
interpretable VLM safety, expanding future avenues for multimodal alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索多模态模型（如LlaVA-Next）如何在隐藏激活中表示图像概念，以理解其跨模态表示能力。

Method: 使用线性解码和稀疏自编码器（SAEs）分析模型中的图像和文本特征，并通过目标编辑验证特征的因果性。

Result: 发现图像和文本特征在浅层分离，但在深层逐渐共享。

Conclusion: 多模态模型的表示能力在深层趋向跨模态共享，为理解模型内部机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: Language models can be equipped with multimodal capabilities by fine-tuning
on embeddings of visual inputs. But how do such multimodal models represent
images in their hidden activations? We explore representations of image
concepts within LlaVA-Next, a popular open-source VLLM. We find a diverse set
of ImageNet classes represented via linearly decodable features in the residual
stream. We show that the features are causal by performing targeted edits on
the model output. In order to increase the diversity of the studied linear
features, we train multimodal Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), creating a highly
interpretable dictionary of text and image features. We find that although
model representations across modalities are quite disjoint, they become
increasingly shared in deeper layers.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文研究了如何通过部分微调视觉编码器结合检索增强和对抗扰动技术，提升预训练视觉语言模型在少样本适应任务中的分布内（ID）和分布外（OOD）准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练视觉语言模型（VLM）在少样本适应任务中表现优异，但在面对分布外测试数据时性能下降。因此，提升少样本适应中的OOD泛化能力至关重要。

Method: 通过比较不同适应方法（如提示调优、线性探测、对比微调和完全微调），发现视觉编码器部分微调效果最佳。在此基础上，提出结合检索增强和对抗扰动的两阶段方法SRAPF。

Result: 实验表明，SRAPF在ImageNet OOD基准测试中实现了最先进的ID和OOD准确性。

Conclusion: 部分微调视觉编码器结合检索增强和对抗扰动的两阶段方法SRAPF，显著提升了少样本适应任务的ID和OOD性能。

Abstract: Pretrained VLMs achieve strong performance on downstream tasks when adapted
with just a few labeled examples. As the adapted models inevitably encounter
out-of-distribution (OOD) test data that deviates from the in-distribution (ID)
task-specific training data, enhancing OOD generalization in few-shot
adaptation is critically important. We study robust few-shot VLM adaptation,
aiming to increase both ID and OOD accuracy. By comparing different adaptation
methods (e.g., prompt tuning, linear probing, contrastive finetuning, and full
finetuning), we uncover three key findings: (1) finetuning with proper
hyperparameters significantly outperforms the popular VLM adaptation methods
prompt tuning and linear probing; (2) visual encoder-only finetuning achieves
better efficiency and accuracy than contrastively finetuning both visual and
textual encoders; (3) finetuning the top layers of the visual encoder provides
the best balance between ID and OOD accuracy. Building on these findings, we
propose partial finetuning of the visual encoder empowered with two simple
augmentation techniques: (1) retrieval augmentation which retrieves
task-relevant data from the VLM's pretraining dataset to enhance adaptation,
and (2) adversarial perturbation which promotes robustness during finetuning.
Results show that the former/latter boosts OOD/ID accuracy while slightly
sacrificing the ID/OOD accuracy. Yet, perhaps understandably, naively combining
the two does not maintain their best OOD/ID accuracy. We address this dilemma
with the developed SRAPF, Stage-wise Retrieval Augmentation-based Adversarial
Partial Finetuning. SRAPF consists of two stages: (1) partial finetuning the
visual encoder using both ID and retrieved data, and (2) adversarial partial
finetuning with few-shot ID data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SRAPF
achieves the state-of-the-art ID and OOD accuracy on the ImageNet OOD
benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AIGV技术发展迅速，但其视觉质量缺陷（如噪声、模糊、帧抖动等）严重影响用户体验，亟需有效的自动质量评估方法。

Method: 将AIGV视觉质量分解为技术质量、运动质量和视频语义三个维度，设计对应编码器提取特征，并引入LLM作为质量回归模块，结合多模态提示工程和LoRA微调技术。

Result: 方法在NTIRE 2025挑战赛中排名第二，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 通过多维度特征和LLM的结合，提出了一种高效的AIGV视觉质量评估方法，为内容监管和生成模型改进提供了支持。

Abstract: The development of AI-Generated Video (AIGV) technology has been remarkable
in recent years, significantly transforming the paradigm of video content
production. However, AIGVs still suffer from noticeable visual quality defects,
such as noise, blurriness, frame jitter and low dynamic degree, which severely
impact the user's viewing experience. Therefore, an effective automatic visual
quality assessment is of great importance for AIGV content regulation and
generative model improvement. In this work, we decompose the visual quality of
AIGVs into three dimensions: technical quality, motion quality, and video
semantics. For each dimension, we design corresponding encoder to achieve
effective feature representation. Moreover, considering the outstanding
performance of large language models (LLMs) in various vision and language
tasks, we introduce a LLM as the quality regression module. To better enable
the LLM to establish reasoning associations between multi-dimensional features
and visual quality, we propose a specially designed multi-modal prompt
engineering framework. Additionally, we incorporate LoRA fine-tuning technology
during the training phase, allowing the LLM to better adapt to specific tasks.
Our proposed method achieved \textbf{second place} in the NTIRE 2025 Quality
Assessment of AI-Generated Content Challenge: Track 2 AI Generated video,
demonstrating its effectiveness. Codes can be obtained at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为iDPOE的新方法，通过结合扩散模型和等变表示，改进了内镜黏膜下剥离术（ESD）视频中解剖轨迹的预测，提升了手术技能训练的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测ESD视频中的解剖轨迹对提升手术技能训练和简化学习过程具有潜力，但目前研究不足。现有模仿学习方法在处理不确定的未来动作、几何对称性和多样化手术场景时存在挑战。

Method: 提出iDPOE方法，通过联合状态动作分布建模专家行为，结合扩散模型进行策略学习，并嵌入等变性以增强几何对称性泛化能力。采用前向过程引导的动作推断策略解决状态不匹配问题。

Result: 在近2000个ESD视频片段的数据集上，iDPOE在轨迹预测任务中优于现有方法（包括显式和隐式方法）。

Conclusion: iDPOE是首次将模仿学习应用于解剖轨迹预测的手术技能开发，展示了其在提升预测准确性和泛化能力方面的潜力。

Abstract: Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) is a well-established technique for
removing epithelial lesions. Predicting dissection trajectories in ESD videos
offers significant potential for enhancing surgical skill training and
simplifying the learning process, yet this area remains underexplored. While
imitation learning has shown promise in acquiring skills from expert
demonstrations, challenges persist in handling uncertain future movements,
learning geometric symmetries, and generalizing to diverse surgical scenarios.
To address these, we introduce a novel approach: Implicit Diffusion Policy with
Equivariant Representations for Imitation Learning (iDPOE). Our method models
expert behavior through a joint state action distribution, capturing the
stochastic nature of dissection trajectories and enabling robust visual
representation learning across various endoscopic views. By incorporating a
diffusion model into policy learning, iDPOE ensures efficient training and
sampling, leading to more accurate predictions and better generalization.
Additionally, we enhance the model's ability to generalize to geometric
symmetries by embedding equivariance into the learning process. To address
state mismatches, we develop a forward-process guided action inference strategy
for conditional sampling. Using an ESD video dataset of nearly 2000 clips,
experimental results show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods,
both explicit and implicit, in trajectory prediction. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first application of imitation learning to surgical
skill development for dissection trajectory prediction.

recall across multiple product types, while maintaining approximately 60%

TL;DR: LAT是一个标签对齐转移框架，通过伪标签生成和特征融合，解决多数据集检测中的语义和空间不一致问题，显著提升目标域检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多数据集结合能提升泛化性，但语义和标注不一致阻碍了其应用。现有方法要么假设共享标签空间，要么需要手动标注，无法满足固定目标标签空间的需求。

Method: LAT通过训练数据集特定检测器生成伪标签，结合特权提案生成器（PPG）和语义特征融合（SFF）模块，实现标签空间转移和特征优化。

Result: LAT在多个基准测试中显著提升目标域检测性能，最高提升+4.8AP。

Conclusion: LAT无需共享标签空间或手动标注，即可同时解决语义和空间不一致问题，适用于异构数据集的目标检测任务。

Abstract: Combining multiple object detection datasets offers a path to improved
generalisation but is hindered by inconsistencies in class semantics and
bounding box annotations. Some methods to address this assume shared label
taxonomies and address only spatial inconsistencies; others require manual
relabelling, or produce a unified label space, which may be unsuitable when a
fixed target label space is required. We propose Label-Aligned Transfer (LAT),
a label transfer framework that systematically projects annotations from
diverse source datasets into the label space of a target dataset. LAT begins by
training dataset-specific detectors to generate pseudo-labels, which are then
combined with ground-truth annotations via a Privileged Proposal Generator
(PPG) that replaces the region proposal network in two-stage detectors. To
further refine region features, a Semantic Feature Fusion (SFF) module injects
class-aware context and features from overlapping proposals using a
confidence-weighted attention mechanism. This pipeline preserves
dataset-specific annotation granularity while enabling many-to-one label space
transfer across heterogeneous datasets, resulting in a semantically and
spatially aligned representation suitable for training a downstream detector.
LAT thus jointly addresses both class-level misalignments and bounding box
inconsistencies without relying on shared label spaces or manual annotations.
Across multiple benchmarks, LAT demonstrates consistent improvements in
target-domain detection performance, achieving gains of up to +4.8AP over
semi-supervised baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Semantic Reward Defense（SRD）的强化学习框架，用于防御视觉语言模型（VLMs）中的后门攻击，无需事先知道触发器即可降低攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现VLMs在图像描述任务中容易受到后门攻击，攻击者通过注入微小扰动（如局部像素触发器或全局语义短语）控制模型生成恶意描述。这些攻击隐蔽且跨模态，难以检测和防御。

Method: 提出SRD框架，利用深度Q网络学习对敏感图像区域施加离散扰动（如遮挡、颜色掩码）的策略，以破坏恶意路径的激活。通过设计语义保真度评分作为奖励信号，指导模型生成鲁棒且准确的描述。

Result: 实验表明，SRD将攻击成功率降至5.6%，同时在干净输入上的性能下降小于10%，保持了描述质量。

Conclusion: SRD提供了一种无需触发器先验知识、可解释的防御范式，有效应对多模态生成模型中的隐蔽后门威胁。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in image
captioning, but recent studies show they are vulnerable to backdoor attacks.
Attackers can inject imperceptible perturbations-such as local pixel triggers
or global semantic phrases-into the training data, causing the model to
generate malicious, attacker-controlled captions for specific inputs. These
attacks are hard to detect and defend due to their stealthiness and cross-modal
nature. By analyzing attack samples, we identify two key vulnerabilities: (1)
abnormal attention concentration on specific image regions, and (2) semantic
drift and incoherence in generated captions. To counter this, we propose
Semantic Reward Defense (SRD), a reinforcement learning framework that
mitigates backdoor behavior without prior knowledge of triggers. SRD uses a
Deep Q-Network to learn policies for applying discrete perturbations (e.g.,
occlusion, color masking) to sensitive image regions, aiming to disrupt the
activation of malicious pathways. We design a semantic fidelity score as the
reward signal, which jointly evaluates semantic consistency and linguistic
fluency of the output, guiding the agent toward generating robust yet faithful
captions. Experiments across mainstream VLMs and datasets show SRD reduces
attack success rates to 5.6%, while preserving caption quality on clean inputs
with less than 10% performance drop. SRD offers a trigger-agnostic,
interpretable defense paradigm against stealthy backdoor threats in multimodal
generative models.

Our method simultaneously estimates transmission maps and spatially-varying

fine-grained details. Our approach also features a novel optimization objective
ensuring both physical adherence and perceptual quality across multiple spatial
frequencies. To validate our approach, we conducted extensive experiments
across six challenging benchmarks. Results demonstrate consistent improvements
of $+0.5$dB PSNR over the best existing methods while requiring only one-third

PSNR improvement when compared to methods with similar computational budgets.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为RAP的数据选择方法，通过识别稀疏的认知样本（cognitive samples）来高效提升多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的推理能力，仅需9.3%的训练数据即可达到或超越全数据集的性能，并减少43%的计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点认为多模态推理能力的提升需要大量训练数据，但作者发现仅少数样本（认知样本）能真正触发有意义的推理，其余样本贡献有限。因此，研究如何高效利用这些高价值样本以减少冗余和计算成本。

Method: 提出RAP范式，包含两个互补的评估器：1）基于潜在结果模型的因果差异评估器（CDE），剔除过度依赖语言先验的样本；2）注意力置信度评估器（ACE），通过自注意力机制剔除无关但被过度强调的样本。此外，引入难度感知替换模块（DRM）以增加样本复杂度。

Result: 在六个数据集上的实验表明，RAP仅使用9.3%的训练数据即可实现更优性能，同时减少43%以上的计算成本。

Conclusion: RAP通过高效选择认知样本，显著提升了多模态推理的效率，为减少数据冗余和计算成本提供了新思路。

Abstract: While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant
progress in complex reasoning tasks via reinforcement learning, it is commonly
believed that extensive training data is necessary for improving multi-modal
reasoning ability, inevitably leading to data redundancy and substantial
computational costs. However, can smaller high-value datasets match or
outperform full corpora for multi-modal reasoning in MLLMs? In this work, we
challenge this assumption through a key observation: meaningful multi-modal
reasoning is triggered by only a sparse subset of training samples, termed
cognitive samples, whereas the majority contribute marginally. Building on this
insight, we propose a novel data selection paradigm termed Reasoning Activation
Potential (RAP), which identifies cognitive samples by estimating each sample's
potential to stimulate genuine multi-modal reasoning by two complementary
estimators: 1) Causal Discrepancy Estimator (CDE) based on the potential
outcome model principle, eliminates samples that overly rely on language priors
by comparing outputs between multi-modal and text-only inputs; 2) Attention
Confidence Estimator (ACE), which exploits token-level self-attention to
discard samples dominated by irrelevant but over-emphasized tokens in
intermediate reasoning stages. Moreover, we introduce a Difficulty-aware
Replacement Module (DRM) to substitute trivial instances with cognitively
challenging ones, thereby ensuring complexity for robust multi-modal reasoning.
Experiments on six datasets show that our RAP method consistently achieves
superior performance using only 9.3% of the training data, while reducing
computational costs by over 43%. Our code is available at
https://github.com/Leo-ssl/RAP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在训练损失中同时使用MAE和SSIM，但忽略了SSIM函数中不同组件及超参数对训练的影响。

Method: 提出了一种新的SSIM形式，用加法替代乘法组合组件，构建更平滑梯度的损失函数，并通过实验确定最优参数组合。

Result: 基于MonoDepth方法，优化的SSIM损失函数在KITTI-2015数据集上显著优于基线。

Conclusion: 新SSIM形式能有效提升无监督单目深度估计的性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised monocular depth learning generally relies on the photometric
relation among temporally adjacent images. Most of previous works use both mean
absolute error (MAE) and structure similarity index measure (SSIM) with
conventional form as training loss. However, they ignore the effect of
different components in the SSIM function and the corresponding hyperparameters
on the training. To address these issues, this work proposes a new form of
SSIM. Compared with original SSIM function, the proposed new form uses addition
rather than multiplication to combine the luminance, contrast, and structural
similarity related components in SSIM. The loss function constructed with this
scheme helps result in smoother gradients and achieve higher performance on
unsupervised depth estimation. We conduct extensive experiments to determine
the relatively optimal combination of parameters for our new SSIM. Based on the
popular MonoDepth approach, the optimized SSIM loss function can remarkably
outperform the baseline on the KITTI-2015 outdoor dataset.

Abstract: When applying Visual Place Recognition (VPR) to real-world mobile robots and
similar applications, perspective-to-equirectangular (P2E) formulation
naturally emerges as a suitable approach to accommodate diverse query images
captured from various viewpoints. In this paper, we introduce HypeVPR, a novel
hierarchical embedding framework in hyperbolic space, designed to address the
unique challenges of P2E VPR. The key idea behind HypeVPR is that visual
environments captured by panoramic views exhibit inherent hierarchical
structures. To leverage this property, we employ hyperbolic space to represent
hierarchical feature relationships and preserve distance properties within the
feature space. To achieve this, we propose a hierarchical feature aggregation
mechanism that organizes local-to-global feature representations within
hyperbolic space. Additionally, HypeVPR adopts an efficient coarse-to-fine
search strategy, optimally balancing speed and accuracy to ensure robust
matching, even between descriptors from different image types. This approach
enables HypeVPR to outperform state-of-the-art methods while significantly
reducing retrieval time, achieving up to 5x faster retrieval across diverse
benchmark datasets. The code and models will be released at

### [176] [Object-X: Learning to Reconstruct Multi-Modal 3D Object Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04789)
*Gaia Di Lorenzo,Federico Tombari,Marc Pollefeys,Daniel Barath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Object-X 是一个多模态 3D 物体表示框架，能够编码丰富的物体嵌入（如图像、点云、文本）并解码为详细的几何和视觉重建。它在 3D 体素网格中融合信息，支持多种下游任务，且存储需求极低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖任务特定的嵌入，无法同时支持几何重建和跨任务复用。Object-X 旨在解决这一问题，提供一种通用且高效的表示框架。

Method: Object-X 通过在 3D 体素网格中几何化多模态信息，并学习非结构化嵌入，结合 3D 高斯泼溅技术进行物体重建。

Result: 在真实数据集上的评估显示，Object-X 在生成高质量新视角合成和几何精度方面表现优异，同时在场景对齐和定位任务中与专用方法竞争。存储需求极低。

Conclusion: Object-X 是一种高效、可扩展的多模态 3D 场景表示解决方案，适用于多种应用场景。

Abstract: Learning effective multi-modal 3D representations of objects is essential for
numerous applications, such as augmented reality and robotics. Existing methods
often rely on task-specific embeddings that are tailored either for semantic
understanding or geometric reconstruction. As a result, these embeddings
typically cannot be decoded into explicit geometry and simultaneously reused
across tasks. In this paper, we propose Object-X, a versatile multi-modal
object representation framework capable of encoding rich object embeddings
(e.g. images, point cloud, text) and decoding them back into detailed geometric
and visual reconstructions. Object-X operates by geometrically grounding the
captured modalities in a 3D voxel grid and learning an unstructured embedding
fusing the information from the voxels with the object attributes. The learned
embedding enables 3D Gaussian Splatting-based object reconstruction, while also
supporting a range of downstream tasks, including scene alignment, single-image
3D object reconstruction, and localization. Evaluations on two challenging
real-world datasets demonstrate that Object-X produces high-fidelity novel-view
synthesis comparable to standard 3D Gaussian Splatting, while significantly
improving geometric accuracy. Moreover, Object-X achieves competitive
performance with specialized methods in scene alignment and localization.
Critically, our object-centric descriptors require 3-4 orders of magnitude less
storage compared to traditional image- or point cloud-based approaches,
establishing Object-X as a scalable and highly practical solution for
multi-modal 3D scene representation.

*Yusuke Matsui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LotusFilter是一种后处理模块，用于多样化近似最近邻搜索（ANNS）结果，通过预计算邻近向量表并贪婪删除冗余向量，实现快速多样化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ANNS在某些场景下可能返回过于相似的结果，而实际需求是结果既相似又多样。

Method: 预计算邻近向量表，过滤时贪婪查找并删除冗余向量。

Result: 在类似真实RAG应用的设置中，LotusFilter运行速度快（0.02 ms/查询）。

Conclusion: LotusFilter能有效多样化ANNS结果，适用于实际应用，代码已开源。

Abstract: Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) is an essential building block for
applications like RAG but can sometimes yield results that are overly similar
to each other. In certain scenarios, search results should be similar to the
query and yet diverse. We propose LotusFilter, a post-processing module to
diversify ANNS results. We precompute a cutoff table summarizing vectors that
are close to each other. During the filtering, LotusFilter greedily looks up
the table to delete redundant vectors from the candidates. We demonstrated that
the LotusFilter operates fast (0.02 [ms/query]) in settings resembling
real-world RAG applications, utilizing features such as OpenAI embeddings. Our
code is publicly available at https://github.com/matsui528/lotf.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SupeRANSAC是一种新型统一的RANSAC流程，旨在提高计算机视觉任务中的鲁棒性估计性能，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RANSAC及其变体在计算机视觉中广泛使用，但性能受实现细节和问题特定优化影响较大，现有框架在不同任务中表现不一。

Method: 提出SupeRANSAC，分析并整合使RANSAC有效的技术，适用于多种视觉任务（如单应性、基础/本质矩阵估计）。

Result: SupeRANSAC在多个任务和数据集上表现优异，例如在基础矩阵估计中平均提高6 AUC点。

Conclusion: SupeRANSAC为计算机视觉任务提供了一种更一致且高性能的鲁棒性估计解决方案。

Abstract: Robust estimation is a cornerstone in computer vision, particularly for tasks
like Structure-from-Motion and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping. RANSAC
and its variants are the gold standard for estimating geometric models (e.g.,
homographies, relative/absolute poses) from outlier-contaminated data. Despite
RANSAC's apparent simplicity, achieving consistently high performance across
different problems is challenging. While recent research often focuses on
improving specific RANSAC components (e.g., sampling, scoring), overall
performance is frequently more influenced by the "bells and whistles" (i.e.,
the implementation details and problem-specific optimizations) within a given
library. Popular frameworks like OpenCV and PoseLib demonstrate varying
performance, excelling in some tasks but lagging in others. We introduce
SupeRANSAC, a novel unified RANSAC pipeline, and provide a detailed analysis of
the techniques that make RANSAC effective for specific vision tasks, including
homography, fundamental/essential matrix, and absolute/rigid pose estimation.
SupeRANSAC is designed for consistent accuracy across these tasks, improving
upon the best existing methods by, for example, 6 AUC points on average for
fundamental matrix estimation. We demonstrate significant performance
improvements over the state-of-the-art on multiple problems and datasets. Code:

TL;DR: 论文介绍了MegaHan97K数据集，支持最新的GB18030-2022标准，包含97,455个汉字类别，解决了长尾分布问题，并揭示了超大类别识别的新挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中文汉字类别庞大且不断扩展，但现有OCR数据集无法覆盖，阻碍了文化保护与数字应用。

Method: 构建MegaHan97K数据集，包含手写、历史和合成三个子集，提供平衡样本。

Result: 数据集支持87,887个GB18030-2022标准字符，揭示了存储需求、形态相似字符识别和零样本学习等新挑战。

Conclusion: MegaHan97K填补了超大类别汉字识别数据集的空白，为未来研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Foundational to the Chinese language and culture, Chinese characters
encompass extraordinarily extensive and ever-expanding categories, with the
latest Chinese GB18030-2022 standard containing 87,887 categories. The accurate
recognition of this vast number of characters, termed mega-category
recognition, presents a formidable yet crucial challenge for cultural heritage
preservation and digital applications. Despite significant advances in Optical
Character Recognition (OCR), mega-category recognition remains unexplored due
to the absence of comprehensive datasets, with the largest existing dataset
containing merely 16,151 categories. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce
MegaHan97K, a mega-category, large-scale dataset covering an unprecedented
97,455 categories of Chinese characters. Our work offers three major
contributions: (1) MegaHan97K is the first dataset to fully support the latest
GB18030-2022 standard, providing at least six times more categories than
existing datasets; (2) It effectively addresses the long-tail distribution
problem by providing balanced samples across all categories through its three
distinct subsets: handwritten, historical and synthetic subsets; (3)
Comprehensive benchmarking experiments reveal new challenges in mega-category
scenarios, including increased storage demands, morphologically similar
character recognition, and zero-shot learning difficulties, while also
unlocking substantial opportunities for future research. To the best of our
knowledge, the MetaHan97K is likely the dataset with the largest classes not
only in the field of OCR but may also in the broader domain of pattern
recognition. The dataset is available at

Motivation: 事件相机具有高时间分辨率和低延迟等优势，但如何高效且抗噪地转换事件流仍是一个挑战。

Method: 结合TBR的帧基优势与脉冲神经网络的噪声过滤能力，提出了Spike-TBR方法，并评估了四种变体。

Result: 在噪声和干净数据上均表现出优越性能，验证了方法的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Spike-TBR为事件驱动视觉应用提供了一种简单且抗噪的解决方案。

Abstract: Event cameras offer significant advantages over traditional frame-based
sensors, including higher temporal resolution, lower latency and dynamic range.
However, efficiently converting event streams into formats compatible with
standard computer vision pipelines remains a challenging problem, particularly
in the presence of noise. In this paper, we propose Spike-TBR, a novel
event-based encoding strategy based on Temporal Binary Representation (TBR),
addressing its vulnerability to noise by integrating spiking neurons. Spike-TBR
combines the frame-based advantages of TBR with the noise-filtering
capabilities of spiking neural networks, creating a more robust representation
of event streams. We evaluate four variants of Spike-TBR, each using different
spiking neurons, across multiple datasets, demonstrating superior performance
in noise-affected scenarios while improving the results on clean data. Our
method bridges the gap between spike-based and frame-based processing, offering
a simple noise-resilient solution for event-driven vision applications.

Abstract: Realistic adversarial attacks on various camera-based perception tasks of
autonomous vehicles have been successfully demonstrated so far. However, only a
few works considered attacks on traffic light detectors. This work shows how
CNNs for traffic light detection can be attacked with printed patches. We
propose a threat model, where each instance of a traffic light is attacked with
a patch placed under it, and describe a training strategy. We demonstrate
successful adversarial patch attacks in universal settings. Our experiments
show realistic targeted red-to-green label-flipping attacks and attacks on
pictogram classification. Finally, we perform a real-world evaluation with
printed patches and demonstrate attacks in the lab settings with a mobile
traffic light for construction sites and in a test area with stationary traffic
lights. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Transformer模型在视频超分辨率任务中面临像素级精度不足、依赖光流对齐等问题，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 提出DualX-VSR，采用双轴空间×时间注意力机制，沿正交方向整合时空信息，简化结构并消除运动补偿需求。

Result: DualX-VSR在真实世界视频超分辨率任务中实现了高保真度和卓越性能。

Conclusion: DualX-VSR通过创新的注意力机制解决了现有Transformer模型的局限性，为视频超分辨率提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Transformer-based models like ViViT and TimeSformer have advanced video
understanding by effectively modeling spatiotemporal dependencies. Recent video
generation models, such as Sora and Vidu, further highlight the power of
transformers in long-range feature extraction and holistic spatiotemporal
modeling. However, directly applying these models to real-world video
super-resolution (VSR) is challenging, as VSR demands pixel-level precision,
which can be compromised by tokenization and sequential attention mechanisms.
While recent transformer-based VSR models attempt to address these issues using
smaller patches and local attention, they still face limitations such as
restricted receptive fields and dependence on optical flow-based alignment,
which can introduce inaccuracies in real-world settings. To overcome these
issues, we propose Dual Axial Spatial$\times$Temporal Transformer for
Real-World Video Super-Resolution (DualX-VSR), which introduces a novel dual
axial spatial$\times$temporal attention mechanism that integrates spatial and
temporal information along orthogonal directions. DualX-VSR eliminates the need
for motion compensation, offering a simplified structure that provides a
cohesive representation of spatiotemporal information. As a result, DualX-VSR
achieves high fidelity and superior performance in real-world VSR task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的2D感知系统依赖显式指令或预定义类别，而3D推理分割缺乏类似框架。

Method: 引入SEG令牌和对象标识符，处理点云和文本提示，生成高精度3D分割掩码。

Result: 在大规模ScanNet数据集上验证了模型的有效性。

Conclusion: OpenMaskDINO3D为3D推理分割提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Although perception systems have made remarkable advancements in recent
years, particularly in 2D reasoning segmentation, these systems still rely on
explicit human instruction or pre-defined categories to identify target objects
before executing visual recognition tasks. Such systems have matured
significantly, demonstrating the ability to reason and comprehend implicit user
intentions in two-dimensional contexts, producing accurate segmentation masks
based on complex and implicit query text. However, a comparable framework and
structure for 3D reasoning segmentation remain absent. This paper introduces
OpenMaskDINO3D, a LLM designed for comprehensive 3D understanding and
segmentation. OpenMaskDINO3D processes point cloud data and text prompts to
produce instance segmentation masks, excelling in many 3D tasks. By introducing
a SEG token and object identifier, we achieve high-precision 3D segmentation
mask generation, enabling the model to directly produce accurate point cloud
segmentation results from natural language instructions. Experimental results
on large-scale ScanNet datasets validate the effectiveness of our
OpenMaskDINO3D across various tasks.

Motivation: 扩散模型在图像生成和编辑中表现优异，但易受后门攻击。现有研究多关注图像生成，而图像编辑领域的后门攻击研究较少且多使用可见触发器，实用性不足。

Method: 利用现成的水印模型将不可感知的水印编码为后门触发器，通过中毒训练数据实现攻击，使模型在水印输入时输出预设目标，而对干净图像按提示正常编辑。

Result: 在不同水印模型上的实验表明，该方法攻击成功率较高，且水印特性分析进一步验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架成功实现了隐蔽的后门攻击，为图像编辑领域的安全研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in both image generation
and editing. However, recent studies have revealed their vulnerability to
backdoor attacks, in which specific patterns embedded in the input can
manipulate the model's behavior. Most existing research in this area has
proposed attack frameworks focused on the image generation pipeline, leaving
backdoor attacks in image editing relatively unexplored. Among the few studies
targeting image editing, most utilize visible triggers, which are impractical
because they introduce noticeable alterations to the input image before
editing. In this paper, we propose a novel attack framework that embeds
invisible triggers into the image editing process via poisoned training data.
We leverage off-the-shelf deep watermarking models to encode imperceptible
watermarks as backdoor triggers. Our goal is to make the model produce the
predefined backdoor target when it receives watermarked inputs, while editing
clean images normally according to the given prompt. With extensive experiments
across different watermarking models, the proposed method achieves promising
attack success rates. In addition, the analysis results of the watermark
characteristics in term of backdoor attack further support the effectiveness of
our approach. The code is available

Motivation: 现代国际象棋引擎依赖深度树搜索和回归评估，而人类玩家则依靠直觉选择候选走法。本文旨在模拟这种直觉驱动的规划过程。

Method: 使用监督对比学习训练Transformer编码器，将棋盘状态嵌入到由位置评估结构化的潜在空间中，距离反映评估相似性。

Result: 模型在仅使用6-ply束搜索的情况下达到2593 Elo评分，性能随模型规模和嵌入维度提升。

Conclusion: 潜在空间规划可能成为传统搜索的替代方案，并可推广到其他完美信息游戏中。

Abstract: Modern chess engines achieve superhuman performance through deep tree search
and regressive evaluation, while human players rely on intuition to select
candidate moves followed by a shallow search to validate them. To model this
intuition-driven planning process, we train a transformer encoder using
supervised contrastive learning to embed board states into a latent space
structured by positional evaluation. In this space, distance reflects
evaluative similarity, and visualized trajectories display interpretable
transitions between game states. We demonstrate that move selection can occur
entirely within this embedding space by advancing toward favorable regions,
without relying on deep search. Despite using only a 6-ply beam search, our
model achieves an estimated Elo rating of 2593. Performance improves with both
model size and embedding dimensionality, suggesting that latent planning may
offer a viable alternative to traditional search. Although we focus on chess,
the proposed embedding-based planning method can be generalized to other
perfect-information games where state evaluations are learnable. All source

TL;DR: Anywhere3D-Bench是一个全面的3D视觉定位基准，涵盖四个层次的任务：人类活动区域、非占用空间、场景中的物体和细粒度物体部件。实验显示，空间级和部件级任务最具挑战性，现有模型在这些任务上表现较差。

Result: 空间级和部件级任务表现最差，最佳模型OpenAI o4-mini在空间级任务上准确率为23.57%，部件级为33.94%。

Conclusion: 当前模型在超越物体级别的3D场景理解和推理能力上存在显著不足。

Abstract: 3D visual grounding has made notable progress in localizing objects within
complex 3D scenes. However, grounding referring expressions beyond objects in
3D scenes remains unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Anywhere3D-Bench, a
holistic 3D visual grounding benchmark consisting of 2,632 referring
expression-3D bounding box pairs spanning four different grounding levels:
human-activity areas, unoccupied space beyond objects, objects in the scene,
and fine-grained object parts. We assess a range of state-of-the-art 3D visual
grounding methods alongside large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs
(MLLMs) on Anywhere3D-Bench. Experimental results reveal that space-level and
part-level visual grounding pose the greatest challenges: space-level tasks
require a more comprehensive spatial reasoning ability, for example, modeling
distances and spatial relations within 3D space, while part-level tasks demand
fine-grained perception of object composition. Even the best performance model,
OpenAI o4-mini, achieves only 23.57% accuracy on space-level tasks and 33.94%
on part-level tasks, significantly lower than its performance on area-level and
object-level tasks. These findings underscore a critical gap in current models'
capacity to understand and reason about 3D scene beyond object-level semantics.

Method: 结合3DGS生成的显式3D表示和FoundationStereo模型的深度估计，通过专家知识转移生成高质量数据集，并用于微调立体模型。

Result: 3DGS生成的数据集在零样本泛化基准上表现良好，但直接使用重建几何会引入噪声；FoundationStereo的视差估计更干净，性能更优。

Conclusion: 3DGS方法展示了低成本、高保真数据集生成的潜力，但其在复杂场景中的鲁棒性仍需进一步研究。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based pipeline for
stereo dataset generation, offering an efficient alternative to Neural Radiance
Fields (NeRF)-based methods. To obtain useful geometry estimates, we explore
utilizing the reconstructed geometry from the explicit 3D representations as
well as depth estimates from the FoundationStereo model in an expert knowledge
transfer setup. We find that when fine-tuning stereo models on 3DGS-generated
datasets, we demonstrate competitive performance in zero-shot generalization
benchmarks. When using the reconstructed geometry directly, we observe that it
is often noisy and contains artifacts, which propagate noise to the trained
model. In contrast, we find that the disparity estimates from FoundationStereo
are cleaner and consequently result in a better performance on the zero-shot
generalization benchmarks. Our method highlights the potential for low-cost,
high-fidelity dataset creation and fast fine-tuning for deep stereo models.
Moreover, we also reveal that while the latest Gaussian Splatting based methods
have achieved superior performance on established benchmarks, their robustness
falls short in challenging in-the-wild settings warranting further exploration.

Abstract: The need to digitize heritage objects is now widely accepted. This article
presents the very fashionable context of the creation of ''digital twins''. It
illustrates the diversity of photographic 3D digitization methods, but this is
not its only objective. Using a selection of objects from the collections of
the mus{\'e}e d'Arch{\'e}ologie nationale, it shows that no single method is
suitable for all cases. Rather, the method to be recommended for a given object
should be the result of a concerted choice between those involved in heritage
and those involved in the digital domain, as each new object may require the
adaptation of existing tools. It would therefore be pointless to attempt an
absolute classification of 3D digitization methods. On the contrary, we need to
find the digital tool best suited to each object, taking into account not only
its characteristics, but also the future use of its digital twin.

Abstract: We introduce CzechLynx, the first large-scale, open-access dataset for
individual identification, 2D pose estimation, and instance segmentation of the
Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx). CzechLynx includes more than 30k camera trap images
annotated with segmentation masks, identity labels, and 20-point skeletons and
covers 219 unique individuals across 15 years of systematic monitoring in two
geographically distinct regions: Southwest Bohemia and the Western Carpathians.
To increase the data variability, we create a complementary synthetic set with
more than 100k photorealistic images generated via a Unity-based pipeline and
diffusion-driven text-to-texture modeling, covering diverse environments,
poses, and coat-pattern variations. To allow testing generalization across

protocols/splits: (i) geo-aware, (ii) time-aware open-set, and (iii) time-aware
closed-set. This dataset is targeted to be instrumental in benchmarking

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has recently shown promise in automated embryo
selection for In-Vitro Fertilization (IVF). However, current approaches either
address partial embryo evaluation lacking holistic quality assessment or target
clinical outcomes inevitably confounded by extra-embryonic factors, both
limiting clinical utility. To bridge this gap, we propose a new task called
Video-Based Embryo Grading - the first paradigm that directly utilizes
full-length time-lapse monitoring (TLM) videos to predict embryologists'
overall quality assessments. To support this task, we curate a real-world
clinical dataset comprising over 2,500 TLM videos, each annotated with a
grading label indicating the overall quality of embryos. Grounded in clinical
decision-making principles, we propose a Complementary Spatial-Temporal Pattern
Mining (CoSTeM) framework that conceptually replicates embryologists'
evaluation process. The CoSTeM comprises two branches: (1) a morphological
branch using a Mixture of Cross-Attentive Experts layer and a Temporal
Selection Block to select discriminative local structural features, and (2) a
morphokinetic branch employing a Temporal Transformer to model global
developmental trajectories, synergistically integrating static and dynamic
determinants for grading embryos. Extensive experimental results demonstrate
the superiority of our design. This work provides a valuable methodological
framework for AI-assisted embryo selection. The dataset and source code will be
publicly available upon acceptance.

*Igor Meleshin,Anna Chistyakova,Anastasia Antsiferova,Dmitriy Vatolin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的视角，将稳健性作为架构先验，通过设计而非数据驱动的方法提升图像质量评估模型的抗攻击能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的数据驱动方法（如对抗训练）在提升图像质量评估模型的稳健性上存在局限性，作者认为稳健性应通过模型设计而非学习来实现。

Method: 通过强制正交信息流和规范保持操作重构模型内部结构，并结合剪枝和微调进一步稳定系统。

Result: 提出了一种稳健的图像质量评估架构，无需对抗训练即可抵御攻击，且对原模型改动较小。

Conclusion: 论文倡导从数据优化转向设计优化，为模型稳健性提供了一种新的解决思路。

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) models are increasingly relied upon to
evaluate image quality in real-world systems -- from compression and
enhancement to generation and streaming. Yet their adoption brings a
fundamental risk: these models are inherently unstable. Adversarial
manipulations can easily fool them, inflating scores and undermining trust.
Traditionally, such vulnerabilities are addressed through data-driven defenses
-- adversarial retraining, regularization, or input purification. But what if
this is the wrong lens? What if robustness in perceptual models is not
something to learn but something to design? In this work, we propose a
provocative idea: robustness as an architectural prior. Rather than training
models to resist perturbations, we reshape their internal structure to suppress
sensitivity from the ground up. We achieve this by enforcing orthogonal
information flow, constraining the network to norm-preserving operations -- and
further stabilizing the system through pruning and fine-tuning. The result is a
robust IQA architecture that withstands adversarial attacks without requiring
adversarial training or significant changes to the original model. This
approach suggests a shift in perspective: from optimizing robustness through
data to engineering it through design.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: APVR框架通过分层视觉信息检索解决长视频理解问题，无需训练，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频多模态大语言模型因计算限制和低效信息提取难以处理小时级视频。

Method: APVR包含Pivot Frame Retrieval（语义扩展和多模态置信度评分）和Pivot Token Retrieval（查询感知的注意力驱动令牌选择）。

Result: 在LongVideoBench和VideoMME上取得显著性能提升，达到SOTA。

Conclusion: APVR为长视频理解提供高效、即插即用的解决方案。

Abstract: Current video-based multimodal large language models struggle with hour-level
video understanding due to computational constraints and inefficient
information extraction from extensive temporal sequences. We propose APVR
(Adaptive Pivot Visual information Retrieval), a training-free framework that
addresses the memory wall limitation through hierarchical visual information
retrieval. APVR operates via two complementary components: Pivot Frame
Retrieval employs semantic expansion and multi-modal confidence scoring to
identify semantically relevant video frames, while Pivot Token Retrieval
performs query-aware attention-driven token selection within the pivot frames.
This dual granularity approach enables processing of hour-long videos while
maintaining semantic fidelity. Experimental validation on LongVideoBench and
VideoMME demonstrates significant performance improvements, establishing
state-of-the-art results for not only training-free but also training-based
approaches while providing plug-and-play integration capability with existing
MLLM architectures.

TL;DR: FEAT是一种高效的全维度注意力Transformer，通过空间-时间-通道注意力机制、线性复杂度设计和残差值引导模块，解决了动态医学视频合成中的关键问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态医学视频合成需要同时建模空间一致性和时间动态性，现有Transformer方法在通道交互、计算复杂性和噪声处理方面存在不足。

Method: FEAT采用空间-时间-通道注意力机制、线性复杂度设计和残差值引导模块，以全局依赖性和精细噪声适应为目标。

Result: FEAT-S参数仅为Endora的23%，性能相当或更优；FEAT-L在多个数据集上超越所有对比方法。

Conclusion: FEAT在动态医学视频合成中表现出高效性和可扩展性，为相关领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: Synthesizing high-quality dynamic medical videos remains a significant
challenge due to the need for modeling both spatial consistency and temporal
dynamics. Existing Transformer-based approaches face critical limitations,
including insufficient channel interactions, high computational complexity from
self-attention, and coarse denoising guidance from timestep embeddings when
handling varying noise levels. In this work, we propose FEAT, a
full-dimensional efficient attention Transformer, which addresses these issues
through three key innovations: (1) a unified paradigm with sequential
spatial-temporal-channel attention mechanisms to capture global dependencies
across all dimensions, (2) a linear-complexity design for attention mechanisms
in each dimension, utilizing weighted key-value attention and global channel
attention, and (3) a residual value guidance module that provides fine-grained
pixel-level guidance to adapt to different noise levels. We evaluate FEAT on
standard benchmarks and downstream tasks, demonstrating that FEAT-S, with only
23\% of the parameters of the state-of-the-art model Endora, achieves
comparable or even superior performance. Furthermore, FEAT-L surpasses all
comparison methods across multiple datasets, showcasing both superior
effectiveness and scalability. Code is available at

TL;DR: 论文比较了利用Segment Anything Model (SAM)和数字表面模型(DSM)进行无人机图像中树冠实例分割的方法，提出了BalSAM模型，在特定场景下表现优于其他方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统森林监测方法成本高、耗时长，无人机遥感和计算机视觉技术为大规模个体树木测绘提供了潜力，尤其是预训练视觉模型SAM在标记数据有限的情况下具有优势。

Method: 比较了SAM在三种森林类型（寒带人工林、温带森林和热带森林）中的树冠实例分割表现，并研究了DSM数据的集成效果，提出了BalSAM模型。

Result: 直接使用SAM的方法未超越定制Mask R-CNN，但通过端到端微调SAM并集成DSM数据，BalSAM在人工林场景中表现更优。

Conclusion: SAM的端到端微调和DSM数据集成是提升树冠实例分割模型性能的有效途径。

Abstract: Information on trees at the individual level is crucial for monitoring forest
ecosystems and planning forest management. Current monitoring methods involve
ground measurements, requiring extensive cost, time and labor. Advances in
drone remote sensing and computer vision offer great potential for mapping
individual trees from aerial imagery at broad-scale. Large pre-trained vision
models, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), represent a particularly
compelling choice given limited labeled data. In this work, we compare methods
leveraging SAM for the task of automatic tree crown instance segmentation in
high resolution drone imagery in three use cases: 1) boreal plantations, 2)
temperate forests and 3) tropical forests. We also study the integration of
elevation data into models, in the form of Digital Surface Model (DSM)
information, which can readily be obtained at no additional cost from RGB drone
imagery. We present BalSAM, a model leveraging SAM and DSM information, which
shows potential over other methods, particularly in the context of plantations.
We find that methods using SAM out-of-the-box do not outperform a custom Mask
R-CNN, even with well-designed prompts. However, efficiently tuning SAM
end-to-end and integrating DSM information are both promising avenues for tree
crown instance segmentation models.

Result: TextVidBench对现有模型提出了显著挑战，同时提出的方法在长视频文本理解能力上取得了改进。

Conclusion: TextVidBench为长视频文本问答任务提供了更真实的评估基准，提出的方法为提升模型能力提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Despite recent progress on the short-video Text-Visual Question Answering
(ViteVQA) task - largely driven by benchmarks such as M4-ViteVQA - existing
datasets still suffer from limited video duration and narrow evaluation scopes,
making it difficult to adequately assess the growing capabilities of powerful
multimodal large language models (MLLMs). To address these limitations, we
introduce TextVidBench, the first benchmark specifically designed for
long-video text question answering (>3 minutes). TextVidBench makes three key
contributions: 1) Cross-domain long-video coverage: Spanning 9 categories
(e.g., news, sports, gaming), with an average video length of 2306 seconds,
enabling more realistic evaluation of long-video understanding. 2) A
three-stage evaluation framework: "Text Needle-in-Haystack -> Temporal
Grounding -> Text Dynamics Captioning". 3) High-quality fine-grained
annotations: Containing over 5,000 question-answer pairs with detailed semantic
labeling. Furthermore, we propose an efficient paradigm for improving large
models through: (i) introducing the IT-Rope mechanism and temporal prompt
engineering to enhance temporal perception, (ii) adopting non-uniform
positional encoding to better handle long video sequences, and (iii) applying
lightweight fine-tuning on video-text data. Extensive experiments on multiple
public datasets as well as TextVidBench demonstrate that our new benchmark
presents significant challenges to existing models, while our proposed method
offers valuable insights into improving long-video scene text understanding
capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VARSR方法存在固定分辨率限制和大模型依赖问题，无法灵活处理多尺度图像且需要大量数据。本文旨在通过创新方法解决这些问题。

Method: 提出两种新组件：1）多尺度图像标记化方法，强制不同尺度间的标记重叠；2）DPO正则化项，仅依赖低分辨率和高分辨率标记化，优化模型输出。

Result: 模型能在单次前向传递中完成去噪和超分辨率处理，使用小模型（300M参数）且无需外部数据，达到了最先进的ISR结果。

Conclusion: 通过多尺度标记化和DPO优化，论文成功解决了VARSR的局限性，为图像超分辨率提供了更高效和灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper we tackle Image Super Resolution (ISR), using recent advances
in Visual Auto-Regressive (VAR) modeling. VAR iteratively estimates the
residual in latent space between gradually increasing image scales, a process
referred to as next-scale prediction. Thus, the strong priors learned during
pre-training align well with the downstream task (ISR). To our knowledge, only
VARSR has exploited this synergy so far, showing promising results. However,
due to the limitations of existing residual quantizers, VARSR works only at a
fixed resolution, i.e. it fails to map intermediate outputs to the
corresponding image scales. Additionally, it relies on a 1B transformer
architecture (VAR-d24), and leverages a large-scale private dataset to achieve
state-of-the-art results. We address these limitations through two novel
components: a) a Hierarchical Image Tokenization approach with a multi-scale
image tokenizer that progressively represents images at different scales while
simultaneously enforcing token overlap across scales, and b) a Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) regularization term that, relying solely on the
LR and HR tokenizations, encourages the transformer to produce the latter over
the former. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a quantizer is
trained to force semantically consistent residuals at different scales, and the
first time that preference-based optimization is used to train a VAR. Using
these two components, our model can denoise the LR image and super-resolve at
half and full target upscale factors in a single forward pass. Additionally, we
achieve \textit{state-of-the-art results on ISR}, while using a small model
(300M params vs ~1B params of VARSR), and without using external training data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频采样方法破坏了评估所需的时间连续性，限制了技能评估的效果。

Method: PATS自适应地分割视频，确保每个分析部分包含完整的关键动作执行，并在多段中重复此过程以最大化信息覆盖。

Result: 在EgoExo4D基准测试中，PATS在所有视角配置下均优于现有方法（+0.65%至+3.05%），在挑战性领域表现尤为突出（如攀岩+26.22%）。

Conclusion: PATS是一种有效的自适应时间采样方法，适用于多样化的活动特性，推动了自动化技能评估在实际应用中的发展。

Abstract: Automated sports skill assessment requires capturing fundamental movement
patterns that distinguish expert from novice performance, yet current video
sampling methods disrupt the temporal continuity essential for proficiency
evaluation. To this end, we introduce Proficiency-Aware Temporal Sampling
(PATS), a novel sampling strategy that preserves complete fundamental movements
within continuous temporal segments for multi-view skill assessment. PATS
adaptively segments videos to ensure each analyzed portion contains full
execution of critical performance components, repeating this process across
multiple segments to maximize information coverage while maintaining temporal
coherence. Evaluated on the EgoExo4D benchmark with SkillFormer, PATS surpasses
the state-of-the-art accuracy across all viewing configurations (+0.65% to
+3.05%) and delivers substantial gains in challenging domains (+26.22%
bouldering, +2.39% music, +1.13% basketball). Systematic analysis reveals that
PATS successfully adapts to diverse activity characteristics-from
high-frequency sampling for dynamic sports to fine-grained segmentation for
sequential skills-demonstrating its effectiveness as an adaptive approach to
temporal sampling that advances automated skill assessment for real-world
applications.

Motivation: 中文场景文本检索因复杂多样的布局而极具挑战性，现有方法基于英文场景设计，性能不足。

Method: 提出CSTR-CLIP模型，结合全局视觉信息与多粒度对齐训练，采用两阶段训练解决现有问题。

Result: CSTR-CLIP在现有基准上准确率提升18.82%，推理速度更快，并在DL-CSVTR上表现优异。

Conclusion: CSTR-CLIP能有效处理多样文本布局，数据集和代码将公开以促进研究。

Abstract: Chinese scene text retrieval is a practical task that aims to search for
images containing visual instances of a Chinese query text. This task is
extremely challenging because Chinese text often features complex and diverse
layouts in real-world scenes. Current efforts tend to inherit the solution for
English scene text retrieval, failing to achieve satisfactory performance. In
this paper, we establish a Diversified Layout benchmark for Chinese Street View
Text Retrieval (DL-CSVTR), which is specifically designed to evaluate retrieval
performance across various text layouts, including vertical, cross-line, and
partial alignments. To address the limitations in existing methods, we propose
Chinese Scene Text Retrieval CLIP (CSTR-CLIP), a novel model that integrates
global visual information with multi-granularity alignment training. CSTR-CLIP
applies a two-stage training process to overcome previous limitations, such as
the exclusion of visual features outside the text region and reliance on
single-granularity alignment, thereby enabling the model to effectively handle
diverse text layouts. Experiments on existing benchmark show that CSTR-CLIP
outperforms the previous state-of-the-art model by 18.82% accuracy and also
provides faster inference speed. Further analysis on DL-CSVTR confirms the
superior performance of CSTR-CLIP in handling various text layouts. The dataset
and code will be publicly available to facilitate research in Chinese scene
text retrieval.

Motivation: 单目深度估计在计算机视觉中具有重要意义，但如何从RGB图像中准确估计深度仍是一个挑战。深度学习的引入推动了该领域的发展，但泛化能力仍需提升。

Method: 论文回顾了多种方法，包括多尺度融合网络、分类任务重定义、附加先验引入以及更有效的目标函数设计。近期方法采用仿射不变损失实现多数据集联合训练。

Result: Depth Anything在零样本单目深度估计中表现领先，尤其擅长从未见图像中提取结构信息，生成结构细节丰富的深度图。

Conclusion: 尽管Depth Anything在度量深度估计上存在不足，但其在结构信息提取方面的优势为单目深度估计提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation aims to determine the depth of each pixel from an
RGB image captured by a monocular camera. The development of deep learning has
significantly advanced this field by facilitating the learning of depth
features from some well-annotated datasets
\cite{Geiger_Lenz_Stiller_Urtasun_2013,silberman2012indoor}. Eigen \textit{et
al.} \cite{eigen2014depth} first introduce a multi-scale fusion network for
depth regression. Following this, subsequent improvements have come from
reinterpreting the regression task as a classification problem
\cite{bhat2021adabins,Li_Wang_Liu_Jiang_2022}, incorporating additional priors
\cite{shao2023nddepth,yang2023gedepth}, and developing more effective objective
function \cite{xian2020structure,Yin_Liu_Shen_Yan_2019}. Despite these
advances, generalizing to unseen domains remains a challenge. Recently, several
methods have employed affine-invariant loss to enable multi-dataset joint
training \cite{MiDaS,ZeroDepth,guizilini2023towards,Dany}. Among them, Depth
Anything \cite{Dany} has shown leading performance in zero-shot monocular depth
estimation. While it struggles to estimate accurate metric depth due to the
lack of explicit depth cues, it excels at extracting structural information
from unseen images, producing structure-detailed monocular depth.

Conclusion: 合成数据能有效替代真实数据，且模型能泛化到未训练的语义类别。

Abstract: Training neural networks for tasks such as 3D point cloud semantic
segmentation demands extensive datasets, yet obtaining and annotating
real-world point clouds is costly and labor-intensive. This work aims to
introduce a novel pipeline for generating realistic synthetic data, by
leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and Gaussian Opacity Fields (GOF) to
generate 3D assets of multiple different agricultural vehicles instead of using
generic models. These assets are placed in a simulated environment, where the
point clouds are generated using a simulated LiDAR. This is a flexible approach
that allows changing the LiDAR specifications without incurring additional
costs. We evaluated the impact of synthetic data on segmentation models such as
PointNet++, Point Transformer V3, and OACNN, by training and validating the
models only on synthetic data. Remarkably, the PTv3 model had an mIoU of
91.35\%, a noteworthy result given that the model had neither been trained nor
validated on any real data. Further studies even suggested that in certain
scenarios the models trained only on synthetically generated data performed
better than models trained on real-world data. Finally, experiments
demonstrated that the models can generalize across semantic classes, enabling
accurate predictions on mesh models they were never trained on.

Conclusion: UAV4D在无人机拍摄动态场景的渲染中表现优异，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in dynamic neural rendering, existing
methods fail to address the unique challenges posed by UAV-captured scenarios,
particularly those involving monocular camera setups, top-down perspective, and
multiple small, moving humans, which are not adequately represented in existing
datasets. In this work, we introduce UAV4D, a framework for enabling
photorealistic rendering for dynamic real-world scenes captured by UAVs.
Specifically, we address the challenge of reconstructing dynamic scenes with
multiple moving pedestrians from monocular video data without the need for
additional sensors. We use a combination of a 3D foundation model and a human
mesh reconstruction model to reconstruct both the scene background and humans.
We propose a novel approach to resolve the scene scale ambiguity and place both
humans and the scene in world coordinates by identifying human-scene contact
points. Additionally, we exploit the SMPL model and background mesh to
initialize Gaussian splats, enabling holistic scene rendering. We evaluated our
method on three complex UAV-captured datasets: VisDrone, Manipal-UAV, and
Okutama-Action, each with distinct characteristics and 10~50 humans. Our
results demonstrate the benefits of our approach over existing methods in novel
view synthesis, achieving a 1.5 dB PSNR improvement and superior visual
sharpness.

Conclusion: 该系统填补了人类专家与自动化数据生成之间的空白，为非IT专家参与ML训练提供了可能。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel physical annotation system designed to generate
training data for automated optical inspection. The system uses pointer-based
in-situ interaction to transfer the valuable expertise of trained inspection
personnel directly into a machine learning (ML) training pipeline. Unlike
conventional screen-based annotation methods, our system captures physical
trajectories and contours directly on the object, providing a more intuitive
and efficient way to label data. The core technology uses calibrated, tracked
pointers to accurately record user input and transform these spatial
interactions into standardised annotation formats that are compatible with
open-source annotation software. Additionally, a simple projector-based
interface projects visual guidance onto the object to assist users during the
annotation process, ensuring greater accuracy and consistency. The proposed
concept bridges the gap between human expertise and automated data generation,
enabling non-IT experts to contribute to the ML training pipeline and
preventing the loss of valuable training samples. Preliminary evaluation
results confirm the feasibility of capturing detailed annotation trajectories
and demonstrate that integration with CVAT streamlines the workflow for
subsequent ML tasks. This paper details the system architecture, calibration
procedures and interface design, and discusses its potential contribution to
future ML data generation for automated optical inspection.

TL;DR: FlowDirector是一种无需反转的视频编辑框架，通过ODE在数据空间中直接演化视频，保持时间一致性和结构细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有基于反转的方法导致的时间不一致和结构退化问题。

Method: 利用ODE在数据空间中直接演化视频，引入注意力引导掩码机制和增强编辑策略。

Result: 在指令遵循、时间一致性和背景保留方面达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: FlowDirector为高效且连贯的视频编辑提供了新范式。

Abstract: Text-driven video editing aims to modify video content according to natural
language instructions. While recent training-free approaches have made progress
by leveraging pre-trained diffusion models, they typically rely on
inversion-based techniques that map input videos into the latent space, which
often leads to temporal inconsistencies and degraded structural fidelity. To
address this, we propose FlowDirector, a novel inversion-free video editing
framework. Our framework models the editing process as a direct evolution in
data space, guiding the video via an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) to
smoothly transition along its inherent spatiotemporal manifold, thereby
preserving temporal coherence and structural details. To achieve localized and
controllable edits, we introduce an attention-guided masking mechanism that
modulates the ODE velocity field, preserving non-target regions both spatially
and temporally. Furthermore, to address incomplete edits and enhance semantic
alignment with editing instructions, we present a guidance-enhanced editing
strategy inspired by Classifier-Free Guidance, which leverages differential
signals between multiple candidate flows to steer the editing trajectory toward
stronger semantic alignment without compromising structural consistency.
Extensive experiments across benchmarks demonstrate that FlowDirector achieves
state-of-the-art performance in instruction adherence, temporal consistency,

Abstract: Vietnamese document analysis and recognition (DAR) is a crucial field with
applications in digitization, information retrieval, and automation. Despite
advancements in OCR and NLP, Vietnamese text recognition faces unique
challenges due to its complex diacritics, tonal variations, and lack of
large-scale annotated datasets. Traditional OCR methods often struggle with
real-world document variations, while deep learning approaches have shown
promise but remain limited by data scarcity and generalization issues.
Recently, large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models have
demonstrated remarkable improvements in text recognition and document
understanding, offering a new direction for Vietnamese DAR. However, challenges
such as domain adaptation, multimodal learning, and computational efficiency
persist. This survey provide a comprehensive review of existing techniques in
Vietnamese document recognition, highlights key limitations, and explores how
LLMs can revolutionize the field. We discuss future research directions,
including dataset development, model optimization, and the integration of
multimodal approaches for improved document intelligence. By addressing these
gaps, we aim to foster advancements in Vietnamese DAR and encourage
community-driven solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升图像编辑工具的指令跟随能力和内容保留效果，尤其是在真实图像输入上。

Method: 1. 改进数据整理流程，引入元信息范式；2. 设计联合学习管道，结合扩散损失和奖励损失。

Result: 在真实图像编辑测试中，SeedEdit 3.0 的可用性率达到 56.1%，优于其他版本和竞品。

Conclusion: SeedEdit 3.0 在多个方面实现了最佳平衡，显著提升了图像编辑的实用性和效果。

Abstract: We introduce SeedEdit 3.0, in companion with our T2I model Seedream 3.0 [22],
which significantly improves over our previous version [27] in both aspects of
edit instruction following and image content (e.g., ID/IP) preservation on real
image inputs. Additional to model upgrading with T2I, in this report, we
present several key improvements. First, we develop an enhanced data curation
pipeline with a meta-info paradigm and meta-info embedding strategy that help
mix images from multiple data sources. This allows us to scale editing data
effectively, and meta information is helpfult to connect VLM with diffusion
model more closely. Second, we introduce a joint learning pipeline for
computing a diffusion loss and a reward loss. Finally, we evaluate SeedEdit 3.0
on our testing benchmarks, for real image editing, where it achieves a best
trade-off between multiple aspects, yielding a high usability rate of 56.1%,
compared to SeedEdit 1.6 (38.4%), GPT4o (37.1%) and Gemini 2.0 (30.3%).

*HaoTian Lan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种多模态街道评估框架（MSEF），结合视觉和语言模型，用于评估街道景观的客观和主观感知，并在中国哈尔滨的15,000张街景图像上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的街道指标无法捕捉主观感知，而主观感知对包容性城市设计至关重要。研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 使用视觉变换器（VisualGLM-6B）和大型语言模型（GPT-4）构建MSEF，并通过LoRA和P-Tuning v2进行参数高效微调。

Result: 模型在客观特征上F1得分为0.84，与居民感知的一致性达89.3%，并揭示了上下文依赖的矛盾和非线性模式。

Conclusion: MSEF为城市感知建模提供了方法创新，并有助于规划系统在基础设施精确性和生活体验之间取得平衡。

Abstract: While objective street metrics derived from imagery or GIS have become
standard in urban analytics, they remain insufficient to capture subjective
perceptions essential to inclusive urban design. This study introduces a novel
Multimodal Street Evaluation Framework (MSEF) that fuses a vision transformer
(VisualGLM-6B) with a large language model (GPT-4), enabling interpretable
dual-output assessment of streetscapes. Leveraging over 15,000 annotated
street-view images from Harbin, China, we fine-tune the framework using LoRA
and P-Tuning v2 for parameter-efficient adaptation. The model achieves an F1
score of 0.84 on objective features and 89.3 percent agreement with aggregated
resident perceptions, validated across stratified socioeconomic geographies.
Beyond classification accuracy, MSEF captures context-dependent contradictions:
for instance, informal commerce boosts perceived vibrancy while simultaneously
reducing pedestrian comfort. It also identifies nonlinear and semantically
contingent patterns -- such as the divergent perceptual effects of
architectural transparency across residential and commercial zones -- revealing
the limits of universal spatial heuristics. By generating natural-language
rationales grounded in attention mechanisms, the framework bridges sensory data
with socio-affective inference, enabling transparent diagnostics aligned with
SDG 11. This work offers both methodological innovation in urban perception
modeling and practical utility for planning systems seeking to reconcile
infrastructural precision with lived experience.

TL;DR: ASTRAEA是一个自动框架，用于优化视频扩散变压器（vDiT）的配置，通过轻量级令牌选择和高效稀疏注意力策略，显著提升推理速度，同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频扩散变压器（vDiT）在文本到视频生成中表现优异，但计算需求高，限制了实际部署。现有加速方法依赖启发式规则，适用性有限。

Method: ASTRAEA提出轻量级令牌选择机制和内存高效的GPU并行稀疏注意力策略，并设计基于进化算法的搜索框架，自动优化令牌预算分配。

Result: 在单GPU上实现2.4倍推理加速（8GPU可达13.2倍），视频质量损失极小（VBench分数损失<0.5%）。

Conclusion: ASTRAEA通过自动优化配置，显著提升了vDiT的推理效率，同时保持了生成质量，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Video diffusion transformers (vDiTs) have made impressive progress in
text-to-video generation, but their high computational demands present major
challenges for practical deployment. While existing acceleration methods reduce
workload at various granularities, they often rely on heuristics, limiting
their applicability.
  We introduce ASTRAEA, an automatic framework that searches for near-optimal
configurations for vDiT-based video generation. At its core, ASTRAEA proposes a
lightweight token selection mechanism and a memory-efficient, GPU-parallel
sparse attention strategy, enabling linear reductions in execution time with
minimal impact on generation quality. To determine optimal token reduction for
different timesteps, we further design a search framework that leverages a
classic evolutionary algorithm to automatically determine the distribution of
the token budget effectively. Together, ASTRAEA achieves up to 2.4x inference
speedup on a single GPU with great scalability (up to 13.2x speedup on 8 GPUs)
while retaining better video quality compared to the state-of-the-art methods
(<0.5% loss on the VBench score compared to the baseline vDiT models).

TL;DR: 论文提出了DIM-CIM框架，用于无参考地测量文本到图像模型的多样性和泛化能力，并构建了COCO-DIMCIM基准测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法依赖参考图像数据集或缺乏多样性测量的特异性，限制了其适应性和可解释性。

Method: 引入DIM-CIM框架，通过COCO-DIMCIM基准测试评估模型的默认模式多样性和泛化能力。

Result: 发现模型在参数规模扩大时泛化能力提升但默认模式多样性下降，并识别了细粒度失败案例。训练数据多样性与默认模式多样性相关性为0.85。

Conclusion: DIM-CIM为评估T2I模型的多样性和泛化能力提供了灵活且可解释的框架。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) models have achieved impressive
quality and consistency. However, this has come at the cost of representation
diversity. While automatic evaluation methods exist for benchmarking model
diversity, they either require reference image datasets or lack specificity
about the kind of diversity measured, limiting their adaptability and
interpretability. To address this gap, we introduce the Does-it/Can-it
framework, DIM-CIM, a reference-free measurement of default-mode diversity
("Does" the model generate images with expected attributes?) and generalization
capacity ("Can" the model generate diverse attributes for a particular
concept?). We construct the COCO-DIMCIM benchmark, which is seeded with COCO
concepts and captions and augmented by a large language model. With
COCO-DIMCIM, we find that widely-used models improve in generalization at the
cost of default-mode diversity when scaling from 1.5B to 8.1B parameters.
DIMCIM also identifies fine-grained failure cases, such as attributes that are
generated with generic prompts but are rarely generated when explicitly
requested. Finally, we use DIMCIM to evaluate the training data of a T2I model
and observe a correlation of 0.85 between diversity in training images and
default-mode diversity. Our work provides a flexible and interpretable
framework for assessing T2I model diversity and generalization, enabling a more
comprehensive understanding of model performance.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种实用的伪造模型（PMM），通过扩展伪造空间和增强训练图像的退化，显著提升了深度伪造检测模型的鲁棒性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度伪造检测模型在非理想条件下性能不稳定，容易被规避。受图像超分辨率领域启发，作者希望通过更全面的伪造模型提升检测器的实用性。

Method: 开发PMM模型，采用泊松混合、多样化掩码、生成器伪影和干扰物扩展伪造空间；通过添加强退化增强训练图像。

Result: 在DFDC和DFDCP数据集上，AUC分别提升3.51%和6.21%，显著增强了模型对常见图像退化的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PMM模型有效提升了检测器的鲁棒性和性能，解决了现有模型在非理想条件下的不稳定问题。

Abstract: Modern deepfake detection models have achieved strong performance even on the
challenging cross-dataset task. However, detection performance under non-ideal
conditions remains very unstable, limiting success on some benchmark datasets
and making it easy to circumvent detection. Inspired by the move to a more
real-world degradation model in the area of image super-resolution, we have
developed a Practical Manipulation Model (PMM) that covers a larger set of
possible forgeries. We extend the space of pseudo-fakes by using Poisson
blending, more diverse masks, generator artifacts, and distractors.
Additionally, we improve the detectors' generality and robustness by adding
strong degradations to the training images. We demonstrate that these changes
not only significantly enhance the model's robustness to common image
degradations but also improve performance on standard benchmark datasets.
Specifically, we show clear increases of $3.51\%$ and $6.21\%$ AUC on the DFDC
and DFDCP datasets, respectively, over the s-o-t-a LAA backbone. Furthermore,
we highlight the lack of robustness in previous detectors and our improvements
in this regard. Code can be found at https://github.com/BenediktHopf/PMM

TL;DR: CIVET框架用于系统评估视觉语言模型（VLMs）对物体属性和关系的理解能力，发现当前VLMs在基础属性识别、位置依赖和关系理解方面存在局限，且未达到人类水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究VLMs对场景结构和语义的理解能力，填补标准化系统评估的空白。

Method: 提出CIVET框架，通过可控刺激系统评估五种先进VLMs，避免噪声和偏差。

Result: VLMs仅能识别有限基础属性，性能受物体位置影响，关系理解能力不足，且未达到人类水平。

Conclusion: 当前VLMs在场景理解方面仍有显著局限，需进一步改进以接近人类能力。

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved competitive performance in
various tasks, their comprehension of the underlying structure and semantics of
a scene remains understudied. To investigate the understanding of VLMs, we
study their capability regarding object properties and relations in a
controlled and interpretable manner. To this scope, we introduce CIVET, a novel
and extensible framework for systematiC evaluatIon Via controllEd sTimuli.
CIVET addresses the lack of standardized systematic evaluation for assessing
VLMs' understanding, enabling researchers to test hypotheses with statistical
rigor. With CIVET, we evaluate five state-of-the-art VLMs on exhaustive sets of
stimuli, free from annotation noise, dataset-specific biases, and uncontrolled
scene complexity. Our findings reveal that 1) current VLMs can accurately
recognize only a limited set of basic object properties; 2) their performance
heavily depends on the position of the object in the scene; 3) they struggle to
understand basic relations among objects. Furthermore, a comparative evaluation
with human annotators reveals that VLMs still fall short of achieving
human-level accuracy.

Abstract: Small, fast, and lightweight drones present significant challenges for
traditional RGB cameras due to their limitations in capturing fast-moving
objects, especially under challenging lighting conditions. Event cameras offer
an ideal solution, providing high temporal definition and dynamic range, yet
existing benchmarks often lack fine temporal resolution or drone-specific
motion patterns, hindering progress in these areas. This paper introduces the
Florence RGB-Event Drone dataset (FRED), a novel multimodal dataset
specifically designed for drone detection, tracking, and trajectory
forecasting, combining RGB video and event streams. FRED features more than 7
hours of densely annotated drone trajectories, using 5 different drone models
and including challenging scenarios such as rain and adverse lighting
conditions. We provide detailed evaluation protocols and standard metrics for
each task, facilitating reproducible benchmarking. The authors hope FRED will
advance research in high-speed drone perception and multimodal spatiotemporal
understanding.

Conclusion: 该方法证明了不依赖神经网络也能实现TWR HAR任务，且具有物理可解释性。开源代码已发布。

Abstract: After a few years of research in the field of through-the-wall radar (TWR)
human activity recognition (HAR), I found that we seem to be stuck in the
mindset of training on radar image data through neural network models. The
earliest related works in this field based on template matching did not require
a training process, and I believe they have never died. Because these methods
possess a strong physical interpretability and are closer to the basis of
theoretical signal processing research. In this paper, I would like to try to
return to the original path by attempting to eschew neural networks to achieve
the TWR HAR task and challenge to achieve intelligent recognition as neural
network models. In detail, the range-time map and Doppler-time map of TWR are
first generated. Then, the initial regions of the human target foreground and
noise background on the maps are determined using corner detection method, and
the micro-Doppler signature is segmented using the multiphase active contour
model. The micro-Doppler segmentation feature is discretized into a
two-dimensional point cloud. Finally, the topological similarity between the
resulting point cloud and the point clouds of the template data is calculated
using Mapper algorithm to obtain the recognition results. The effectiveness of
the proposed method is demonstrated by numerical simulated and measured
experiments. The open-source code of this work is released at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频异常检测方法多关注异常帧或对象，忽略了更细粒度的分析（如异常像素），限制了检测范围。TAO旨在解决这一问题。

Method: TAO框架首次将多粒度异常对象检测统一到一个框架中，通过像素级跟踪异常对象，并将其与分割和跟踪任务结合。

Result: 实验表明，TAO在准确性和鲁棒性上设定了新的基准。

Conclusion: TAO通过细粒度分析和像素级跟踪，显著提升了视频异常检测的能力。

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial in scenarios such as surveillance
and autonomous driving, where timely detection of unexpected activities is
essential. Although existing methods have primarily focused on detecting
anomalous objects in videos -- either by identifying anomalous frames or
objects -- they often neglect finer-grained analysis, such as anomalous pixels,
which limits their ability to capture a broader range of anomalies. To address
this challenge, we propose a new framework called Track Any Anomalous Object
(TAO), which introduces a granular video anomaly detection pipeline that, for
the first time, integrates the detection of multiple fine-grained anomalous
objects into a unified framework. Unlike methods that assign anomaly scores to
every pixel, our approach transforms the problem into pixel-level tracking of
anomalous objects. By linking anomaly scores to downstream tasks such as
segmentation and tracking, our method removes the need for threshold tuning and
achieves more precise anomaly localization in long and complex video sequences.
Experiments demonstrate that TAO sets new benchmarks in accuracy and
robustness. Project page available online.

Motivation: 适应预训练的病理基础模型（PFMs）用于特定临床任务面临挑战，主要由于WSI级弱标签和需要MIL范式。

Method: 提出TAPFM方法，通过ViT注意力进行MIL聚合，优化特征和注意力权重，保持MIL聚合器和PFM的独立计算图以实现稳定训练。

Result: 在膀胱癌和肺腺癌突变预测任务中，TAPFM表现优于传统方法，且能有效处理多标签分类。

Conclusion: TAPFM使预训练PFM在标准硬件上的适应成为可能，适用于多种临床应用。

Abstract: Pathology foundation models (PFMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
analyzing whole slide images (WSIs). However, adapting these pretrained PFMs
for specific clinical tasks presents considerable challenges, primarily due to
the availability of only weak (WSI-level) labels for gigapixel images,
necessitating multiple instance learning (MIL) paradigm for effective WSI
analysis. This paper proposes a novel approach for single-GPU \textbf{T}ask
\textbf{A}daptation of \textbf{PFM}s (TAPFM) that uses vision transformer
(\vit) attention for MIL aggregation while optimizing both for feature
representations and attention weights. The proposed approach maintains separate
computational graphs for MIL aggregator and the PFM to create stable training
dynamics that align with downstream task objectives during end-to-end
adaptation. Evaluated on mutation prediction tasks for bladder cancer and lung
adenocarcinoma across institutional and TCGA cohorts, TAPFM consistently
outperforms conventional approaches, with H-Optimus-0 (TAPFM) outperforming the
benchmarks. TAPFM effectively handles multi-label classification of actionable
mutations as well. Thus, TAPFM makes adaptation of powerful pre-trained PFMs
practical on standard hardware for various clinical applications.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多模态感知的高效微调策略MokA，解决了现有方法忽视多模态特性导致模态利用不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高效多模态微调方法多直接借鉴LLMs，忽视了多模态场景的固有差异，导致模态利用不足。

Method: 提出MokA策略，通过模态特定参数压缩单模态信息，同时显式增强跨模态交互，实现单模态和跨模态适配。

Result: 在多种多模态场景和LLM骨干上的实验表明MokA具有一致改进效果，验证了其有效性和通用性。

Conclusion: MokA为MLLMs的高效适配提供了更有针对性的解决方案，为后续探索铺平了道路。

Abstract: In this paper, we reveal that most current efficient multimodal fine-tuning
methods are hindered by a key limitation: they are directly borrowed from LLMs,
often neglecting the intrinsic differences of multimodal scenarios and even
affecting the full utilization of all modalities. Inspired by our empirical
observation, we argue that unimodal adaptation and cross-modal adaptation are
two essential parts for the effective fine-tuning of MLLMs. From this
perspective, we propose Multimodal low-rank Adaptation (MokA), a
multimodal-aware efficient fine-tuning strategy that takes multimodal
characteristics into consideration. It compresses unimodal information by
modality-specific parameters while explicitly enhancing cross-modal
interaction, ensuring both unimodal and cross-modal adaptation. Extensive
experiments cover three representative multimodal scenarios (audio-visual-text,
visual-text, and speech-text), and multiple LLM backbones (LLaMA2/3, Qwen2,
Qwen2.5-VL, etc). Consistent improvements indicate the efficacy and versatility
of the proposed method. Ablation studies and efficiency evaluation are also
conducted to fully asses our method. Overall, we think MokA provides a more
targeted solution for efficient adaptation of MLLMs, paving the way for further
exploration. The project page is at https://gewu-lab.github.io/MokA.

Motivation: 在非视距条件下实现可靠的毫米波通信是军事和民用领域的主要挑战，尤其是在城市或基础设施有限的环境中。

Method: 系统利用单目摄像头检测ArUco标记，估计到达角，并通过电机驱动的金属板动态调整反射器方向，实现信号最优重定向。

Result: 实验结果显示，在60GHz频段下，接收信号强度平均增益为23dB，信号接收概率为0.89（阈值-65dB），显著优于静态和无反射器基线。

Conclusion: 该系统在复杂动态环境中展现了增强毫米波通信的潜力，具有自适应性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Reliable millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication in non-line-of-sight (NLoS)
conditions remains a major challenge for both military and civilian operations,
especially in urban or infrastructure-limited environments. This paper presents
a vision-aided autonomous reflector system designed to enhance mmWave link
performance by dynamically steering signal reflections using a motorized
metallic plate. The proposed system leverages a monocular camera to detect
ArUco markers on allied transmitter and receiver nodes, estimate their angles
of arrival, and align the reflector in real time for optimal signal
redirection. This approach enables selective beam coverage by serving only
authenticated targets with visible markers and reduces the risk of unintended
signal exposure. The designed prototype, built on a Raspberry Pi 4 and
low-power hardware, operates autonomously without reliance on external
infrastructure or GPS. Experimental results at 60\,GHz demonstrate a 23\,dB
average gain in received signal strength and an 0.89 probability of maintaining
signal reception above a target threshold of -65 dB in an indoor environment,
far exceeding the static and no-reflector baselines. These results demonstrate
the system's potential for resilient and adaptive mmWave connectivity in
complex and dynamic environments.

acquisition for real-world, knowledge-intensive tasks. While previous studies
primarily investigate memorization within a single modality, such as text
memorization in large language models or image memorization in diffusion
models, unified multimodal models are becoming increasingly prevalent in
practical applications. In this work, we focus on the unique characteristics of
cross-modality memorization and conduct a systematic study centered on
vision-language models. To facilitate controlled experiments, we first
introduce a synthetic persona dataset comprising diverse synthetic person
images and textual descriptions. We quantify factual knowledge memorization and
cross-modal transferability by training models on a single modality and
evaluating their performance in the other. Our results reveal that facts
learned in one modality transfer to the other, but a significant gap exists
between recalling information in the source and target modalities. Furthermore,
we observe that this gap exists across various scenarios, including more
capable models, machine unlearning, and the multi-hop case. At the end, we
propose a baseline method to mitigate this challenge. We hope our study can
inspire future research on developing more robust multimodal learning
techniques to enhance cross-modal transferability.

TL;DR: DEGround提出了一种新的3D grounding方法，通过共享DETR查询实现检测与grounding的结合，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究探索了3D grounding是否真正受益于检测模型，发现现有方法可能未充分利用检测能力。

Method: 提出DEGround框架，结合检测与grounding，引入区域激活模块和查询调制模块。

Result: DEGround在EmbodiedScan验证集上比BIP3D模型提升了7.52%的准确率。

Conclusion: DEGround通过改进检测与grounding的结合，显著提升了3D grounding的性能。

Abstract: Embodied 3D grounding aims to localize target objects described in human
instructions from ego-centric viewpoint. Most methods typically follow a
two-stage paradigm where a trained 3D detector's optimized backbone parameters
are used to initialize a grounding model. In this study, we explore a
fundamental question: Does embodied 3D grounding benefit enough from detection?
To answer this question, we assess the grounding performance of detection
models using predicted boxes filtered by the target category. Surprisingly,
these detection models without any instruction-specific training outperform the
grounding models explicitly trained with language instructions. This indicates
that even category-level embodied 3D grounding may not be well resolved, let
alone more fine-grained context-aware grounding. Motivated by this finding, we
propose DEGround, which shares DETR queries as object representation for both
DEtection and Grounding and enables the grounding to benefit from basic
category classification and box detection. Based on this framework, we further
introduce a regional activation grounding module that highlights
instruction-related regions and a query-wise modulation module that
incorporates sentence-level semantic into the query representation,
strengthening the context-aware understanding of language instructions.
Remarkably, DEGround outperforms state-of-the-art model BIP3D by 7.52\% at
overall accuracy on the EmbodiedScan validation set. The source code will be
publicly available at https://github.com/zyn213/DEGround.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OGGSplat是一种基于开放高斯增长的方法，用于从稀疏视图重建语义感知的3D场景，通过RGB-语义一致性修复模块和双向扩散模型控制，实现了语义一致性和视觉合理性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏视图重建语义感知3D场景的需求源于虚拟现实和具身AI等新兴应用，现有方法在计算成本和视图范围上存在局限性。

Method: 提出OGGSplat方法，利用开放高斯的语义属性进行图像外推，结合RGB-语义一致性修复模块和双向扩散模型控制，优化高斯参数。

Result: 在Gaussian Outpainting基准测试中表现优异，支持智能手机拍摄的两视图图像重建。

Conclusion: OGGSplat在稀疏视图下实现了高效的语义感知3D场景重建，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Reconstructing semantic-aware 3D scenes from sparse views is a challenging
yet essential research direction, driven by the demands of emerging
applications such as virtual reality and embodied AI. Existing per-scene
optimization methods require dense input views and incur high computational
costs, while generalizable approaches often struggle to reconstruct regions
outside the input view cone. In this paper, we propose OGGSplat, an open
Gaussian growing method that expands the field-of-view in generalizable 3D
reconstruction. Our key insight is that the semantic attributes of open
Gaussians provide strong priors for image extrapolation, enabling both semantic
consistency and visual plausibility. Specifically, once open Gaussians are
initialized from sparse views, we introduce an RGB-semantic consistent
inpainting module applied to selected rendered views. This module enforces
bidirectional control between an image diffusion model and a semantic diffusion
model. The inpainted regions are then lifted back into 3D space for efficient
and progressive Gaussian parameter optimization. To evaluate our method, we
establish a Gaussian Outpainting (GO) benchmark that assesses both semantic and
generative quality of reconstructed open-vocabulary scenes. OGGSplat also
demonstrates promising semantic-aware scene reconstruction capabilities when
provided with two view images captured directly from a smartphone camera.

Motivation: 现有基于LoRA的运动迁移方法在大规模视频扩散变换器中存在运动不一致和调优效率低的问题。

Method: 提出时空解耦的LoRA架构，稀疏运动采样和自适应RoPE加速调优。

Result: 在MotionBench上验证了Follow-Your-Motion的优越性。

Conclusion: Follow-Your-Motion框架在运动迁移任务中表现出高效性和一致性。

Abstract: Recently, breakthroughs in the video diffusion transformer have shown
remarkable capabilities in diverse motion generations. As for the
motion-transfer task, current methods mainly use two-stage Low-Rank Adaptations
(LoRAs) finetuning to obtain better performance. However, existing
adaptation-based motion transfer still suffers from motion inconsistency and
tuning inefficiency when applied to large video diffusion transformers. Naive
two-stage LoRA tuning struggles to maintain motion consistency between
generated and input videos due to the inherent spatial-temporal coupling in the
3D attention operator. Additionally, they require time-consuming fine-tuning
processes in both stages. To tackle these issues, we propose
Follow-Your-Motion, an efficient two-stage video motion transfer framework that
finetunes a powerful video diffusion transformer to synthesize complex
motion.Specifically, we propose a spatial-temporal decoupled LoRA to decouple
the attention architecture for spatial appearance and temporal motion
processing. During the second training stage, we design the sparse motion
sampling and adaptive RoPE to accelerate the tuning speed. To address the lack
of a benchmark for this field, we introduce MotionBench, a comprehensive
benchmark comprising diverse motion, including creative camera motion, single
object motion, multiple object motion, and complex human motion. We show
extensive evaluations on MotionBench to verify the superiority of
Follow-Your-Motion.

Motivation: 解决从有限观测中构建高效且物理一致的世界模型的挑战，避免传统隐式生成模型和多阶段处理的不足。

Result: 实验表明，DSG-World在新视角和场景状态下具有强泛化能力，支持高保真渲染和对象级场景操作。

Conclusion: DSG-World为真实世界的3D重建和模拟提供了一种高效且一致的方法。

Abstract: Building an efficient and physically consistent world model from limited
observations is a long standing challenge in vision and robotics. Many existing
world modeling pipelines are based on implicit generative models, which are
hard to train and often lack 3D or physical consistency. On the other hand,
explicit 3D methods built from a single state often require multi-stage
processing-such as segmentation, background completion, and inpainting-due to
occlusions. To address this, we leverage two perturbed observations of the same
scene under different object configurations. These dual states offer
complementary visibility, alleviating occlusion issues during state transitions
and enabling more stable and complete reconstruction. In this paper, we present
DSG-World, a novel end-to-end framework that explicitly constructs a 3D
Gaussian World model from Dual State observations. Our approach builds dual
segmentation-aware Gaussian fields and enforces bidirectional photometric and
semantic consistency. We further introduce a pseudo intermediate state for
symmetric alignment and design collaborative co-pruning trategies to refine
geometric completeness. DSG-World enables efficient real-to-simulation transfer
purely in the explicit Gaussian representation space, supporting high-fidelity
rendering and object-level scene manipulation without relying on dense
observations or multi-stage pipelines. Extensive experiments demonstrate strong
generalization to novel views and scene states, highlighting the effectiveness
of our approach for real-world 3D reconstruction and simulation.

TL;DR: MonkeyOCR是一种基于SRR（结构-识别-关系）三元范式的视觉语言模型，用于文档解析，通过简化流程和高效处理，在精度和速度上取得平衡，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文档解析方法（如MinerU的模块化方法或大型端到端模型）存在复杂性或效率低下的问题，MonkeyOCR旨在通过SRR范式解决这些问题。

Method: 采用SRR三元范式，将文档解析分解为结构、识别和关系三个核心问题，分别对应布局分析、内容识别和逻辑排序。

Result: MonkeyOCR在MonkeyDoc数据集上表现优异，平均提升5.1%，尤其在公式和表格处理上显著改进；其3B参数模型超越更大模型（如Qwen2.5-VL和Gemini 2.5 Pro），且处理速度更快。

Conclusion: MonkeyOCR通过SRR范式实现了高效、精确的文档解析，适用于多语言和多类型文档，且易于部署。

Abstract: We introduce MonkeyOCR, a vision-language model for document parsing that
advances the state of the art by leveraging a Structure-Recognition-Relation
(SRR) triplet paradigm. This design simplifies what would otherwise be a
complex multi-tool pipeline (as in MinerU's modular approach) and avoids the
inefficiencies of processing full pages with giant end-to-end models (e.g.,
large multimodal LLMs like Qwen-VL). In SRR, document parsing is abstracted
into three fundamental questions - "Where is it?" (structure), "What is it?"
(recognition), and "How is it organized?" (relation) - corresponding to layout
analysis, content identification, and logical ordering. This focused
decomposition balances accuracy and speed: it enables efficient, scalable
processing without sacrificing precision. To train and evaluate this approach,
we introduce the MonkeyDoc (the most comprehensive document parsing dataset to
date), with 3.9 million instances spanning over ten document types in both
Chinese and English. Experiments show that MonkeyOCR outperforms MinerU by an
average of 5.1%, with particularly notable improvements on challenging content
such as formulas (+15.0%) and tables (+8.6%). Remarkably, our 3B-parameter
model surpasses much larger and top-performing models, including Qwen2.5-VL
(72B) and Gemini 2.5 Pro, achieving state-of-the-art average performance on
English document parsing tasks. In addition, MonkeyOCR processes multi-page
documents significantly faster (0.84 pages per second compared to 0.65 for
MinerU and 0.12 for Qwen2.5-VL-7B). The 3B model can be efficiently deployed
for inference on a single NVIDIA 3090 GPU. Code and models will be released at
https://github.com/Yuliang-Liu/MonkeyOCR.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SAM-TTA的新方法，通过测试时适配框架提升SAM在医学图像分割中的性能，同时保持其泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于SAM在医学领域的适应性有限，现有方法（如MedSAM）虽能提升性能，但牺牲了泛化能力。因此，需要一种既能提升性能又不损害泛化的解决方案。

Method: SAM-TTA包含两部分：(1) SBCT，自适应转换单通道医学图像为三通道输入；(2) DUMT，通过一致性学习对齐SAM的内部表示与医学语义。

Result: 在五个公开数据集上的实验表明，SAM-TTA优于现有TTA方法，甚至在某些场景下超越完全微调的模型（如MedSAM）。

Conclusion: SAM-TTA为通用医学图像分割建立了新范式，代码已开源。

Abstract: Universal medical image segmentation using the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
remains challenging due to its limited adaptability to medical domains.
Existing adaptations, such as MedSAM, enhance SAM's performance in medical
imaging but at the cost of reduced generalization to unseen data. Therefore, in
this paper, we propose SAM-aware Test-Time Adaptation (SAM-TTA), a
fundamentally different pipeline that preserves the generalization of SAM while
improving its segmentation performance in medical imaging via a test-time
framework. SAM-TTA tackles two key challenges: (1) input-level discrepancies
caused by differences in image acquisition between natural and medical images
and (2) semantic-level discrepancies due to fundamental differences in object
definition between natural and medical domains (e.g., clear boundaries vs.
ambiguous structures). Specifically, our SAM-TTA framework comprises (1)
Self-adaptive Bezier Curve-based Transformation (SBCT), which adaptively
converts single-channel medical images into three-channel SAM-compatible inputs
while maintaining structural integrity, to mitigate the input gap between
medical and natural images, and (2) Dual-scale Uncertainty-driven Mean Teacher
adaptation (DUMT), which employs consistency learning to align SAM's internal
representations to medical semantics, enabling efficient adaptation without
auxiliary supervision or expensive retraining. Extensive experiments on five
public datasets demonstrate that our SAM-TTA outperforms existing TTA
approaches and even surpasses fully fine-tuned models such as MedSAM in certain
scenarios, establishing a new paradigm for universal medical image
segmentation. Code can be found at https://github.com/JianghaoWu/SAM-TTA.

TL;DR: MoViX是一种自监督的跨视角视频定位框架，用于GPS缺失的越野环境，通过学习视角和季节不变的表示，实现高精度定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决GPS缺失环境下因重复植被、非结构化地形和季节变化导致的定位困难。

Method: 采用姿态依赖的正样本采样、时间对齐的硬负样本挖掘、运动信息帧采样器和轻量级时间聚合器。

Result: 在TartanDrive 2.0数据集上，93%的情况下定位误差在25米内，100%在50米内，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MoViX在无需环境特定调优的情况下，表现出强大的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Robust cross-view 3-DoF localization in GPS-denied, off-road environments
remains challenging due to (1) perceptual ambiguities from repetitive
vegetation and unstructured terrain, and (2) seasonal shifts that significantly
alter scene appearance, hindering alignment with outdated satellite imagery. To
address this, we introduce MoViX, a self-supervised cross-view video
localization framework that learns viewpoint- and season-invariant
representations while preserving directional awareness essential for accurate
localization. MoViX employs a pose-dependent positive sampling strategy to
enhance directional discrimination and temporally aligned hard negative mining
to discourage shortcut learning from seasonal cues. A motion-informed frame
sampler selects spatially diverse frames, and a lightweight temporal aggregator
emphasizes geometrically aligned observations while downweighting ambiguous
ones. At inference, MoViX runs within a Monte Carlo Localization framework,
using a learned cross-view matching module in place of handcrafted models.
Entropy-guided temperature scaling enables robust multi-hypothesis tracking and
confident convergence under visual ambiguity. We evaluate MoViX on the
TartanDrive 2.0 dataset, training on under 30 minutes of data and testing over
12.29 km. Despite outdated satellite imagery, MoViX localizes within 25 meters
of ground truth 93% of the time, and within 50 meters 100% of the time in
unseen regions, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines without
environment-specific tuning. We further demonstrate generalization on a
real-world off-road dataset from a geographically distinct site with a
different robot platform.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Video-LLMs使用偏好对齐技术（如DPO）时，常导致目标和非目标响应的对数似然同时下降，从而意外提升非目标响应的概率。

Method: 提出LeanPO方法，重新定义奖励为策略模型响应的平均似然，并结合自生成偏好数据管道和动态标签平滑策略。

Result: 实验表明LeanPO显著提升Video-LLMs性能，且额外训练开销小。

Conclusion: LeanPO为Video-LLMs提供了一种简单有效的偏好对齐方案，提升模型可靠性和效率。

Abstract: Most Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) adopt preference alignment
techniques, e.g., DPO~\citep{rafailov2024dpo}, to optimize the reward margin
between a winning response ($y_w$) and a losing response ($y_l$). However, the
likelihood displacement observed in DPO indicates that both $\log \pi_\theta
(y_w\mid x)$ and $\log \pi_\theta (y_l\mid x) $ often decrease during training,
inadvertently boosting the probabilities of non-target responses. In this
paper, we systematically revisit this phenomenon from LLMs to Video-LLMs,
showing that it intensifies when dealing with the redundant complexity of video
content. To alleviate the impact of this phenomenon, we propose \emph{Lean
Preference Optimization} (LeanPO), a reference-free approach that reformulates
the implicit reward as the average likelihood of the response with respect to
the policy model. A key component of LeanPO is the reward-trustworthiness
correlated self-generated preference data pipeline, which carefully infuses
relevant prior knowledge into the model while continuously refining the
preference data via self-reflection. This allows the policy model to obtain
high-quality paired data and accurately estimate the newly defined reward, thus
mitigating the unintended drop. In addition, we introduce a dynamic label
smoothing strategy that mitigates the impact of noise in responses from diverse
video content, preventing the model from overfitting to spurious details.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that LeanPO significantly enhances the
performance of state-of-the-art Video-LLMs, consistently boosting baselines of
varying capacities with minimal additional training overhead. Moreover, LeanPO
offers a simple yet effective solution for aligning Video-LLM preferences with
human trustworthiness, paving the way toward the reliable and efficient
Video-LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前PAD系统因隐私保护限制，通常仅针对少数ID卡训练，导致在未知国家ID卡上表现不佳。基础模型因其大规模数据训练可能提供更好的泛化能力。

Method: 研究采用零样本学习和微调两种方法，并使用两个数据集（智利ID卡私有数据集和芬兰、西班牙、斯洛伐克的公开数据集）进行测试。

Result: 研究发现，真实图像（bona fide）是提升泛化能力的关键。

Conclusion: 基础模型在ID卡防伪检测中具有潜力，尤其是通过真实图像优化泛化能力。

Abstract: Nowadays, one of the main challenges in presentation attack detection (PAD)
on ID cards is obtaining generalisation capabilities for a diversity of
countries that are issuing ID cards. Most PAD systems are trained on one, two,
or three ID documents because of privacy protection concerns. As a result, they
do not obtain competitive results for commercial purposes when tested in an
unknown new ID card country. In this scenario, Foundation Models (FM) trained
on huge datasets can help to improve generalisation capabilities. This work
intends to improve and benchmark the capabilities of FM and how to use them to
adapt the generalisation on PAD of ID Documents. Different test protocols were
used, considering zero-shot and fine-tuning and two different ID card datasets.
One private dataset based on Chilean IDs and one open-set based on three ID
countries: Finland, Spain, and Slovakia. Our findings indicate that bona fide
images are the key to generalisation.

Motivation: 现有视频检索基准未能充分测试对快速、细微时间变化的捕捉能力，因此需要一个新的基准来填补这一空白。

Method: 提出TF-CoVR基准，使用LLM生成查询-修改对，并设计了两阶段训练框架TF-CoVR-Base：先预训练视频编码器，再通过对比学习对齐查询与候选视频。

Result: TF-CoVR-Base在零样本和微调设置下均显著提升了检索性能，mAP@50分别从5.92提升到7.51和从19.83提升到25.82。

Conclusion: TF-CoVR为时间细粒度视频检索提供了首个大规模基准，并通过TF-CoVR-Base框架展示了显著性能提升。

Abstract: Composed Video Retrieval (CoVR) retrieves a target video given a query video
and a modification text describing the intended change. Existing CoVR
benchmarks emphasize appearance shifts or coarse event changes and therefore do
not test the ability to capture subtle, fast-paced temporal differences. We
introduce TF-CoVR, the first large-scale benchmark dedicated to temporally
fine-grained CoVR. TF-CoVR focuses on gymnastics and diving and provides 180K
triplets drawn from FineGym and FineDiving. Previous CoVR benchmarks focusing
on temporal aspect, link each query to a single target segment taken from the
same video, limiting practical usefulness. In TF-CoVR, we instead construct
each <query, modification> pair by prompting an LLM with the label differences
between clips drawn from different videos; every pair is thus associated with
multiple valid target videos (3.9 on average), reflecting real-world tasks such
as sports-highlight generation. To model these temporal dynamics we propose
TF-CoVR-Base, a concise two-stage training framework: (i) pre-train a video
encoder on fine-grained action classification to obtain temporally
discriminative embeddings; (ii) align the composed query with candidate videos
using contrastive learning. We conduct the first comprehensive study of image,
video, and general multimodal embedding (GME) models on temporally fine-grained
composed retrieval in both zero-shot and fine-tuning regimes. On TF-CoVR,
TF-CoVR-Base improves zero-shot mAP@50 from 5.92 (LanguageBind) to 7.51, and
after fine-tuning raises the state-of-the-art from 19.83 to 25.82.

Result: 在Waymo、NuScenes、Argoverse和PandaSet四个数据集上表现优异，几何精度显著提升。

Conclusion: 多尺度双边网格有效减少光度不一致导致的浮游物，对自动驾驶场景重建至关重要。

Abstract: Neural rendering techniques, including NeRF and Gaussian Splatting (GS), rely
on photometric consistency to produce high-quality reconstructions. However, in
real-world scenarios, it is challenging to guarantee perfect photometric
consistency in acquired images. Appearance codes have been widely used to
address this issue, but their modeling capability is limited, as a single code
is applied to the entire image. Recently, the bilateral grid was introduced to
perform pixel-wise color mapping, but it is difficult to optimize and constrain
effectively. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-scale bilateral grid that
unifies appearance codes and bilateral grids. We demonstrate that this approach
significantly improves geometric accuracy in dynamic, decoupled autonomous
driving scene reconstruction, outperforming both appearance codes and bilateral
grids. This is crucial for autonomous driving, where accurate geometry is
important for obstacle avoidance and control. Our method shows strong results
across four datasets: Waymo, NuScenes, Argoverse, and PandaSet. We further
demonstrate that the improvement in geometry is driven by the multi-scale
bilateral grid, which effectively reduces floaters caused by photometric
inconsistency.

Conclusion: Rectified Point Flow 提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案，显著提升了点云配准和形状组装的性能。

Abstract: We introduce Rectified Point Flow, a unified parameterization that formulates
pairwise point cloud registration and multi-part shape assembly as a single
conditional generative problem. Given unposed point clouds, our method learns a
continuous point-wise velocity field that transports noisy points toward their
target positions, from which part poses are recovered. In contrast to prior
work that regresses part-wise poses with ad-hoc symmetry handling, our method
intrinsically learns assembly symmetries without symmetry labels. Together with
a self-supervised encoder focused on overlapping points, our method achieves a
new state-of-the-art performance on six benchmarks spanning pairwise
registration and shape assembly. Notably, our unified formulation enables
effective joint training on diverse datasets, facilitating the learning of
shared geometric priors and consequently boosting accuracy. Project page:

Result: 评估显示，相比基线模型，新框架在生成质量、一致性和上下文长度上均有提升。

Conclusion: 该框架为长时一致的世界生成提供了新方向。

Abstract: Emerging world models autoregressively generate video frames in response to
actions, such as camera movements and text prompts, among other control
signals. Due to limited temporal context window sizes, these models often
struggle to maintain scene consistency during revisits, leading to severe
forgetting of previously generated environments. Inspired by the mechanisms of
human memory, we introduce a novel framework to enhancing long-term consistency
of video world models through a geometry-grounded long-term spatial memory. Our
framework includes mechanisms to store and retrieve information from the
long-term spatial memory and we curate custom datasets to train and evaluate
world models with explicitly stored 3D memory mechanisms. Our evaluations show
improved quality, consistency, and context length compared to relevant
baselines, paving the way towards long-term consistent world generation.

TL;DR: RaySt3R将3D形状补全问题重新定义为新视角合成问题，通过单张RGB-D图像和多视角查询射线预测深度图、物体掩码和置信度，实现高效且一致的3D重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D形状补全方法缺乏3D一致性、计算成本高且难以捕捉尖锐边界，RaySt3R旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 使用单张RGB-D图像和查询射线，训练前馈Transformer预测深度图、物体掩码和置信度，并通过多视角融合重建完整3D形状。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上表现优异，3D chamfer距离比基线方法提升高达44%。

Conclusion: RaySt3R通过新视角合成方法显著提升了3D形状补全的性能和效率。

Abstract: 3D shape completion has broad applications in robotics, digital twin
reconstruction, and extended reality (XR). Although recent advances in 3D
object and scene completion have achieved impressive results, existing methods
lack 3D consistency, are computationally expensive, and struggle to capture
sharp object boundaries. Our work (RaySt3R) addresses these limitations by
recasting 3D shape completion as a novel view synthesis problem. Specifically,
given a single RGB-D image and a novel viewpoint (encoded as a collection of
query rays), we train a feedforward transformer to predict depth maps, object
masks, and per-pixel confidence scores for those query rays. RaySt3R fuses
these predictions across multiple query views to reconstruct complete 3D
shapes. We evaluate RaySt3R on synthetic and real-world datasets, and observe
it achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the baselines on all
datasets by up to 44% in 3D chamfer distance. Project page:

*Lijie Hu,Songning Lai,Yuan Hua,Shu Yang,Jingfeng Zhang,Di Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出Vision Concept Transformer (VCT)和Stable Vision Concept Transformer (SVCT)，解决现有概念瓶颈模型(CBMs)在医学领域中忽略图像特征和解释不稳定性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学领域对透明度的需求促使研究者探索可解释AI (XAI)。现有CBMs仅依赖概念特征，忽略了医学图像的固有特征，且解释不稳定。

Method: VCT结合概念特征与图像特征；SVCT基于VCT，利用ViT作为主干网络，并引入Denoised Diffusion Smoothing确保解释稳定性。

Result: 在四个医学数据集上的实验表明，VCT和SVCT在保持准确性的同时具有可解释性，SVCT在扰动下仍能提供稳定解释。

Conclusion: VCT和SVCT解决了CBMs的局限性，满足了医学领域对准确性和解释稳定性的需求。

Abstract: Transparency is a paramount concern in the medical field, prompting
researchers to delve into the realm of explainable AI (XAI). Among these XAI
methods, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) aim to restrict the model's latent
space to human-understandable high-level concepts by generating a conceptual
layer for extracting conceptual features, which has drawn much attention
recently. However, existing methods rely solely on concept features to
determine the model's predictions, which overlook the intrinsic feature
embeddings within medical images. To address this utility gap between the
original models and concept-based models, we propose Vision Concept Transformer
(VCT). Furthermore, despite their benefits, CBMs have been found to negatively
impact model performance and fail to provide stable explanations when faced
with input perturbations, which limits their application in the medical field.
To address this faithfulness issue, this paper further proposes the Stable
Vision Concept Transformer (SVCT) based on VCT, which leverages the vision
transformer (ViT) as its backbone and incorporates a conceptual layer. SVCT
employs conceptual features to enhance decision-making capabilities by fusing
them with image features and ensures model faithfulness through the integration
of Denoised Diffusion Smoothing. Comprehensive experiments on four medical
datasets demonstrate that our VCT and SVCT maintain accuracy while remaining
interpretable compared to baselines. Furthermore, even when subjected to
perturbations, our SVCT model consistently provides faithful explanations, thus
meeting the needs of the medical field.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了EOC-Bench，一个用于评估动态第一人称场景中物体中心化认知能力的创新基准，填补了现有基准在动态交互评估上的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注静态场景，忽视了用户交互引起的动态变化，因此需要一个新的基准来系统评估动态场景中的物体认知能力。

Method: 开发了EOC-Bench，包含3,277个标注QA对，分为三个时间类别（过去、现在、未来），覆盖11个细粒度评估维度和3种视觉物体引用类型。采用了混合格式的人机协作标注框架和多尺度时间准确性指标。

Result: 基于EOC-Bench，对多种专有、开源和物体级MLLMs进行了全面评估，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: EOC-Bench为提升MLLMs的物体认知能力提供了关键工具，为开发可靠的嵌入式系统核心模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: The emergence of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has driven
breakthroughs in egocentric vision applications. These applications necessitate
persistent, context-aware understanding of objects, as users interact with
tools in dynamic and cluttered environments. However, existing embodied
benchmarks primarily focus on static scene exploration, emphasizing object's
appearance and spatial attributes while neglecting the assessment of dynamic
changes arising from users' interactions. To address this gap, we introduce
EOC-Bench, an innovative benchmark designed to systematically evaluate
object-centric embodied cognition in dynamic egocentric scenarios. Specially,
EOC-Bench features 3,277 meticulously annotated QA pairs categorized into three
temporal categories: Past, Present, and Future, covering 11 fine-grained
evaluation dimensions and 3 visual object referencing types. To ensure thorough
assessment, we develop a mixed-format human-in-the-loop annotation framework
with four types of questions and design a novel multi-scale temporal accuracy
metric for open-ended temporal evaluation. Based on EOC-Bench, we conduct
comprehensive evaluations of various proprietary, open-source, and object-level
MLLMs. EOC-Bench serves as a crucial tool for advancing the embodied object
cognitive capabilities of MLLMs, establishing a robust foundation for
developing reliable core models for embodied systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像分词器在压缩过程中编码的双向依赖关系阻碍了自回归模型的有效建模。

Method: 提出AliTok，利用因果解码器建立单向依赖关系，结合前缀标记和两阶段分词器训练提升重建一致性。

Result: 在ImageNet-256基准测试中，AliTok在177M参数下gFID为1.50，IS为305.9；662M参数时gFID为1.35，超越现有扩散方法且采样速度快10倍。

Conclusion: AliTok在生成友好性和重建性能上表现优异，为自回归图像生成提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Autoregressive image generation aims to predict the next token based on
previous ones. However, existing image tokenizers encode tokens with
bidirectional dependencies during the compression process, which hinders the
effective modeling by autoregressive models. In this paper, we propose a novel
Aligned Tokenizer (AliTok), which utilizes a causal decoder to establish
unidirectional dependencies among encoded tokens, thereby aligning the token
modeling approach between the tokenizer and autoregressive model. Furthermore,
by incorporating prefix tokens and employing two-stage tokenizer training to
enhance reconstruction consistency, AliTok achieves great reconstruction
performance while being generation-friendly. On ImageNet-256 benchmark, using a
standard decoder-only autoregressive model as the generator with only 177M
parameters, AliTok achieves a gFID score of 1.50 and an IS of 305.9. When the
parameter count is increased to 662M, AliTok achieves a gFID score of 1.35,
surpassing the state-of-the-art diffusion method with 10x faster sampling
speed. The code and weights are available at

TL;DR: SeedVR2是一个基于扩散模型的一步视频修复方法，通过对抗训练和动态窗口注意力机制，显著降低了计算成本并提升了高分辨率视频修复的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管扩散模型在视频修复中表现出色，但其计算成本过高，且现有的一步修复方法难以扩展到高分辨率视频场景。

Method: 提出SeedVR2模型，采用对抗训练和动态窗口注意力机制，优化模型架构和训练过程，引入特征匹配损失以稳定训练。

Result: 实验表明，SeedVR2在单步修复中性能优于或接近现有方法。

Conclusion: SeedVR2通过创新设计和训练策略，实现了高效且高质量的视频修复。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based video restoration (VR) demonstrate
significant improvement in visual quality, yet yield a prohibitive
computational cost during inference. While several distillation-based
approaches have exhibited the potential of one-step image restoration,
extending existing approaches to VR remains challenging and underexplored,
particularly when dealing with high-resolution video in real-world settings. In
this work, we propose a one-step diffusion-based VR model, termed as SeedVR2,
which performs adversarial VR training against real data. To handle the
challenging high-resolution VR within a single step, we introduce several
enhancements to both model architecture and training procedures. Specifically,
an adaptive window attention mechanism is proposed, where the window size is
dynamically adjusted to fit the output resolutions, avoiding window
inconsistency observed under high-resolution VR using window attention with a
predefined window size. To stabilize and improve the adversarial post-training
towards VR, we further verify the effectiveness of a series of losses,
including a proposed feature matching loss without significantly sacrificing
training efficiency. Extensive experiments show that SeedVR2 can achieve
comparable or even better performance compared with existing VR approaches in a
single step.

Motivation: 提升区域级视觉理解的全面性，结合分割模型与语言模型，实现多模态输出。

Method: 引入 Semantic Perceiver 转换 SAM 2 的视觉特征为多模态 token，并开发数据增强流程，生成高质量数据集。

Result: PAM 在多项任务中表现优异，运行速度快 1.2-2.4 倍，GPU 内存消耗更低。

Conclusion: PAM 为区域级视觉理解提供了高效实用的解决方案，可作为未来研究的基准。

Abstract: We present Perceive Anything Model (PAM), a conceptually straightforward and
efficient framework for comprehensive region-level visual understanding in
images and videos. Our approach extends the powerful segmentation model SAM 2
by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling simultaneous object
segmentation with the generation of diverse, region-specific semantic outputs,
including categories, label definition, functional explanations, and detailed
captions. A key component, Semantic Perceiver, is introduced to efficiently
transform SAM 2's rich visual features, which inherently carry general vision,
localization, and semantic priors into multi-modal tokens for LLM
comprehension. To support robust multi-granularity understanding, we also
develop a dedicated data refinement and augmentation pipeline, yielding a
high-quality dataset of 1.5M image and 0.6M video region-semantic annotations,
including novel region-level streaming video caption data. PAM is designed for
lightweightness and efficiency, while also demonstrates strong performance
across a diverse range of region understanding tasks. It runs 1.2-2.4x faster
and consumes less GPU memory than prior approaches, offering a practical
solution for real-world applications. We believe that our effective approach
will serve as a strong baseline for future research in region-level visual
understanding.

<details>

Motivation: 解决语义匹配中对称物体或重复物体部分导致的模糊性问题。

Method: 训练适配器以优化现成特征，利用3D感知链式伪标签、松弛循环一致性和3D球形原型映射约束。

Result: 在SPair-71k上实现了4%的绝对增益，比类似监督要求的方法高出7%。

Conclusion: 该方法减少了特定数据集标注的需求，并展示了在其他数据源上的扩展性。

Abstract: Finding correspondences between semantically similar points across images and
object instances is one of the everlasting challenges in computer vision. While
large pre-trained vision models have recently been demonstrated as effective
priors for semantic matching, they still suffer from ambiguities for symmetric
objects or repeated object parts. We propose to improve semantic correspondence
estimation via 3D-aware pseudo-labeling. Specifically, we train an adapter to
refine off-the-shelf features using pseudo-labels obtained via 3D-aware
chaining, filtering wrong labels through relaxed cyclic consistency, and 3D
spherical prototype mapping constraints. While reducing the need for dataset
specific annotations compared to prior work, we set a new state-of-the-art on
SPair-71k by over 4% absolute gain and by over 7% against methods with similar
supervision requirements. The generality of our proposed approach simplifies
extension of training to other data sources, which we demonstrate in our
experiments.

Result: 实现了对粗糙度、金属感、透明度和发光等细粒度材料属性的参数化控制，并在单次前向传递中完成多次编辑。

Conclusion: MARBLE方法在材料编辑方面表现出色，适用于绘画等多种应用场景。

Abstract: Editing materials of objects in images based on exemplar images is an active
area of research in computer vision and graphics. We propose MARBLE, a method
for performing material blending and recomposing fine-grained material
properties by finding material embeddings in CLIP-space and using that to
control pre-trained text-to-image models. We improve exemplar-based material
editing by finding a block in the denoising UNet responsible for material
attribution. Given two material exemplar-images, we find directions in the
CLIP-space for blending the materials. Further, we can achieve parametric
control over fine-grained material attributes such as roughness, metallic,
transparency, and glow using a shallow network to predict the direction for the
desired material attribute change. We perform qualitative and quantitative
analysis to demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method. We also present
the ability of our method to perform multiple edits in a single forward pass
and applicability to painting.

Conclusion: ProJo4D为物理基础的4D场景理解提供了有效解决方案，适用于机器人学和XR等领域的实际应用。

Abstract: Neural rendering has made significant strides in 3D reconstruction and novel
view synthesis. With the integration with physics, it opens up new
applications. The inverse problem of estimating physics from visual data,
however, still remains challenging, limiting its effectiveness for applications
like physically accurate digital twin creation in robotics and XR. Existing
methods that incorporate physics into neural rendering frameworks typically
require dense multi-view videos as input, making them impractical for scalable,
real-world use. When presented with sparse multi-view videos, the sequential
optimization strategy used by existing approaches introduces significant error
accumulation, e.g., poor initial 3D reconstruction leads to bad material
parameter estimation in subsequent stages. Instead of sequential optimization,
directly optimizing all parameters at the same time also fails due to the
highly non-convex and often non-differentiable nature of the problem. We
propose ProJo4D, a progressive joint optimization framework that gradually
increases the set of jointly optimized parameters guided by their sensitivity,
leading to fully joint optimization over geometry, appearance, physical state,
and material property. Evaluations on PAC-NeRF and Spring-Gaus datasets show
that ProJo4D outperforms prior work in 4D future state prediction, novel view
rendering of future state, and material parameter estimation, demonstrating its
effectiveness in physically grounded 4D scene understanding. For demos, please

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索3D VLMs在任务中的性能差异，尤其是3D场景中心模型表现不佳的原因。

Method: 分类3D VLMs为3D对象中心、2D图像基础和3D场景中心方法，并进行深入分析。

Result: 3D场景中心模型对3D编码器依赖不足，预训练效果较差，且数据扩展收益不明显。

Conclusion: 需要改进评估策略和数据集设计，以提升3D VLMs的3D场景理解能力。

Abstract: Remarkable progress in 2D Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has spurred interest
in extending them to 3D settings for tasks like 3D Question Answering, Dense
Captioning, and Visual Grounding. Unlike 2D VLMs that typically process images
through an image encoder, 3D scenes, with their intricate spatial structures,
allow for diverse model architectures. Based on their encoder design, this
paper categorizes recent 3D VLMs into 3D object-centric, 2D image-based, and 3D
scene-centric approaches. Despite the architectural similarity of 3D
scene-centric VLMs to their 2D counterparts, they have exhibited comparatively
lower performance compared with the latest 3D object-centric and 2D image-based
approaches. To understand this gap, we conduct an in-depth analysis, revealing
that 3D scene-centric VLMs show limited reliance on the 3D scene encoder, and
the pre-train stage appears less effective than in 2D VLMs. Furthermore, we
observe that data scaling benefits are less pronounced on larger datasets. Our
investigation suggests that while these models possess cross-modal alignment
capabilities, they tend to over-rely on linguistic cues and overfit to frequent
answer distributions, thereby diminishing the effective utilization of the 3D
encoder. To address these limitations and encourage genuine 3D scene
understanding, we introduce a novel 3D Relevance Discrimination QA dataset
designed to disrupt shortcut learning and improve 3D understanding. Our
findings highlight the need for advanced evaluation and improved strategies for
better 3D understanding in 3D VLMs.

Motivation: 深度图在3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）中常用于生成3D点云进行新视角合成，但物体边界的深度不连续性会导致点云稀疏或碎片化，影响渲染质量。

Method: 引入PM-Loss，通过预训练Transformer预测的点图作为正则化损失，强制几何平滑性，尤其是在物体边界处。

Result: 改进后的深度图显著提升了不同架构和场景下的3DGS渲染效果。

Conclusion: PM-Loss有效解决了深度不连续性问题，提升了3DGS的渲染质量。

Abstract: Depth maps are widely used in feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
pipelines by unprojecting them into 3D point clouds for novel view synthesis.
This approach offers advantages such as efficient training, the use of known
camera poses, and accurate geometry estimation. However, depth discontinuities
at object boundaries often lead to fragmented or sparse point clouds, degrading
rendering quality -- a well-known limitation of depth-based representations. To
tackle this issue, we introduce PM-Loss, a novel regularization loss based on a
pointmap predicted by a pre-trained transformer. Although the pointmap itself
may be less accurate than the depth map, it effectively enforces geometric
smoothness, especially around object boundaries. With the improved depth map,
our method significantly improves the feed-forward 3DGS across various
architectures and scenes, delivering consistently better rendering results. Our

Conclusion: CG-AV-Counting和AV-Reasoner为视频计数任务提供了新工具，但域外泛化能力仍需改进。

Abstract: Despite progress in video understanding, current MLLMs struggle with counting
tasks. Existing benchmarks are limited by short videos, close-set queries, lack
of clue annotations, and weak multimodal coverage. In this paper, we introduce
CG-AV-Counting, a manually-annotated clue-grounded counting benchmark with
1,027 multimodal questions and 5,845 annotated clues over 497 long videos. It
supports both black-box and white-box evaluation, serving as a comprehensive
testbed for both end-to-end and reasoning-based counting. To explore ways to
improve model's counting capability, we propose AV-Reasoner, a model trained
with GRPO and curriculum learning to generalize counting ability from related
tasks. AV-Reasoner achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple
benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of reinforcement learning. However,
experiments show that on out-of-domain benchmarks, reasoning in the language

Conclusion: MINT-CoT在多模态数学推理中表现出色，为视觉与文本结合的推理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has widely enhanced mathematical reasoning in Large
Language Models (LLMs), but it still remains challenging for extending it to
multimodal domains. Existing works either adopt a similar textual reasoning for
image input, or seek to interleave visual signals into mathematical CoT.
However, they face three key limitations for math problem-solving: reliance on
coarse-grained box-shaped image regions, limited perception of vision encoders
on math content, and dependence on external capabilities for visual
modification. In this paper, we propose MINT-CoT, introducing Mathematical
INterleaved Tokens for Chain-of-Thought visual reasoning. MINT-CoT adaptively
interleaves relevant visual tokens into textual reasoning steps via an
Interleave Token, which dynamically selects visual regions of any shapes within
math figures. To empower this capability, we construct the MINT-CoT dataset,
containing 54K mathematical problems aligning each reasoning step with visual
regions at the token level, accompanied by a rigorous data generation pipeline.
We further present a three-stage MINT-CoT training strategy, progressively
combining text-only CoT SFT, interleaved CoT SFT, and interleaved CoT RL, which
derives our MINT-CoT-7B model. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method for effective visual interleaved reasoning in
mathematical domains, where MINT-CoT-7B outperforms the baseline model by
+34.08% on MathVista, +28.78% on GeoQA, and +23.2% on MMStar, respectively. Our

underexplored. To close this gap, we present VideoMarathon, a large-scale
hour-long video instruction-following dataset. This dataset includes around
9,700 hours of long videos sourced from diverse domains, ranging from 3 to 60
minutes per video. Specifically, it contains 3.3M high-quality QA pairs,
spanning six fundamental topics: temporality, spatiality, object, action,
scene, and event. Compared to existing video instruction datasets,
VideoMarathon significantly extends training video durations up to 1 hour, and
supports 22 diverse tasks requiring both short- and long-term video
comprehension. Building on VideoMarathon, we propose Hour-LLaVA, a powerful and
efficient Video-LMM for hour-scale video-language modeling. It enables
hour-long video training and inference at 1-FPS sampling by leveraging a memory
augmentation module, which adaptively integrates user question-relevant and
spatiotemporal-informative semantics from a cached full video context. In our
experiments, Hour-LLaVA achieves the best performance on multiple long
video-language benchmarks, demonstrating the high quality of the VideoMarathon
dataset and the superiority of the Hour-LLaVA model.

TL;DR: VideoMolmo是一个针对细粒度时空指向任务的多模态大模型，结合了语言模型的推理能力和视频序列的时空一致性，显著提升了指向准确性和推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于视频的方法在跟踪任务中表现良好，但缺乏语言模型的上下文理解和泛化能力。VideoMolmo旨在解决这一问题，通过结合语言模型和视频序列处理技术，实现更精确的时空指向。

Method: VideoMolmo基于Molmo架构，引入了一个时间模块（注意力机制）和一个新颖的时序掩码融合管道（SAM2双向点传播），分两步处理任务：首先生成精确的指向坐标，然后通过掩码融合模块生成连贯的分割。

Result: VideoMolmo在自建的72k视频-字幕对数据集和VPoS-Bench基准测试中表现出色，显著提升了时空指向准确性和推理能力。

Conclusion: VideoMolmo通过结合语言模型和视频处理技术，实现了更精确的时空指向和推理能力，为多领域应用提供了新工具。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal localization is vital for precise interactions across diverse
domains, from biological research to autonomous navigation and interactive
interfaces. Current video-based approaches, while proficient in tracking, lack
the sophisticated reasoning capabilities of large language models, limiting
their contextual understanding and generalization. We introduce VideoMolmo, a
large multimodal model tailored for fine-grained spatio-temporal pointing
conditioned on textual descriptions. Building upon the Molmo architecture,
VideoMolmo incorporates a temporal module utilizing an attention mechanism to
condition each frame on preceding frames, ensuring temporal consistency.
Additionally, our novel temporal mask fusion pipeline employs SAM2 for
bidirectional point propagation, significantly enhancing coherence across video
sequences. This two-step decomposition, i.e., first using the LLM to generate
precise pointing coordinates, then relying on a sequential mask-fusion module
to produce coherent segmentation, not only simplifies the task for the language
model but also enhances interpretability. Due to the lack of suitable datasets,
we curate a comprehensive dataset comprising 72k video-caption pairs annotated
with 100k object points. To evaluate the generalization of VideoMolmo, we
introduce VPoS-Bench, a challenging out-of-distribution benchmark spanning five
real-world scenarios: Cell Tracking, Egocentric Vision, Autonomous Driving,
Video-GUI Interaction, and Robotics. We also evaluate our model on Referring
Video Object Segmentation (Refer-VOS) and Reasoning VOS tasks. In comparison to
existing models, VideoMolmo substantially improves spatio-temporal pointing
accuracy and reasoning capability. Our code and models are publicly available
at https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/VideoMolmo.

TL;DR: 提出了一种从室内空间的多视角全景图像和纹理网格中生成去家具化副本的流程，通过简化网格和ControlNet修复技术实现高质量结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如神经辐射场或RGB-D修复）在生成去家具化副本时存在模糊或幻觉问题，需要一种更可靠的方法。

Method: 1. 从网格中分割并移除家具，生成简化去家具化网格（SDM）；2. 从SDM提取Canny边缘作为ControlNet修复的引导信号；3. 修复全景图像并纹理化网格。

Result: 该方法生成的资产质量高于依赖神经辐射场或RGB-D修复的方法，避免了模糊和幻觉问题。

Conclusion: 提出的流程通过结合几何引导和修复技术，显著提升了去家具化副本的质量和可靠性。

Abstract: We present a pipeline for generating defurnished replicas of indoor spaces
represented as textured meshes and corresponding multi-view panoramic images.
To achieve this, we first segment and remove furniture from the mesh
representation, extend planes, and fill holes, obtaining a simplified
defurnished mesh (SDM). This SDM acts as an ``X-ray'' of the scene's underlying
structure, guiding the defurnishing process. We extract Canny edges from depth
and normal images rendered from the SDM. We then use these as a guide to remove
the furniture from panorama images via ControlNet inpainting. This control
signal ensures the availability of global geometric information that may be
hidden from a particular panoramic view by the furniture being removed. The
inpainted panoramas are used to texture the mesh. We show that our approach
produces higher quality assets than methods that rely on neural radiance
fields, which tend to produce blurry low-resolution images, or RGB-D
inpainting, which is highly susceptible to hallucinations.

TL;DR: DirectLayout是一个直接从文本描述生成3D室内场景布局的框架，利用大语言模型的空间推理能力，解决了现有方法在开放词汇和细粒度用户指令对齐上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D室内场景合成对具身AI和数字内容创作至关重要，但现有方法在布局生成上存在数据集有限和灵活性不足的问题。

Method: DirectLayout通过三个阶段生成布局：鸟瞰图生成、3D空间提升和对象放置优化，结合Chain-of-Thought激活和生成奖励增强空间推理。

Result: 实验表明，DirectLayout在语义一致性、泛化能力和物理合理性上表现优异。

Conclusion: DirectLayout通过直接生成和空间推理，显著提升了3D场景布局的质量和可控性。

Abstract: Realistic 3D indoor scene synthesis is vital for embodied AI and digital
content creation. It can be naturally divided into two subtasks: object
generation and layout generation. While recent generative models have
significantly advanced object-level quality and controllability, layout
generation remains challenging due to limited datasets. Existing methods either
overfit to these datasets or rely on predefined constraints to optimize
numerical layout that sacrifice flexibility. As a result, they fail to generate
scenes that are both open-vocabulary and aligned with fine-grained user
instructions. We introduce DirectLayout, a framework that directly generates
numerical 3D layouts from text descriptions using generalizable spatial
reasoning of large language models (LLMs). DirectLayout decomposes the
generation into three stages: producing a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) layout, lifting
it into 3D space, and refining object placements. To enable explicit spatial
reasoning and help the model grasp basic principles of object placement, we
employ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Activation based on the 3D-Front dataset.
Additionally, we design CoT-Grounded Generative Layout Reward to enhance
generalization and spatial planning. During inference, DirectLayout addresses
asset-layout mismatches via Iterative Asset-Layout Alignment through in-context
learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DirectLayout achieves
impressive semantic consistency, generalization and physical plausibility.

Motivation: 现有的图像分割模型无法基于语言和视觉的复杂查询提供全面的语义理解，限制了其在需要用户友好交互的应用中的效果。

Method: 提出了RAS框架，通过掩码中心的大型多模态模型增强分割模型的多模态交互和理解能力。

Result: 在ORES任务及经典RES和GRES任务上，RAS表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: ORES任务和RAS框架为多模态交互提供了新的解决方案，并在多个任务中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Recent image segmentation models have advanced to segment images into
high-quality masks for visual entities, and yet they cannot provide
comprehensive semantic understanding for complex queries based on both language
and vision. This limitation reduces their effectiveness in applications that
require user-friendly interactions driven by vision-language prompts. To bridge
this gap, we introduce a novel task of omnimodal referring expression
segmentation (ORES). In this task, a model produces a group of masks based on
arbitrary prompts specified by text only or text plus reference visual
entities. To address this new challenge, we propose a novel framework to "Refer
to Any Segmentation Mask Group" (RAS), which augments segmentation models with
complex multimodal interactions and comprehension via a mask-centric large
multimodal model. For training and benchmarking ORES models, we create datasets
MaskGroups-2M and MaskGroups-HQ to include diverse mask groups specified by
text and reference entities. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate
superior performance of RAS on our new ORES task, as well as classic referring
expression segmentation (RES) and generalized referring expression segmentation
(GRES) tasks. Project page: https://Ref2Any.github.io.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）中仅有少量注意力头（约5%）对视觉理解有贡献，称为视觉头。通过无训练框架识别这些头，并提出了SparseMM优化策略，显著提升了推理效率和内存利用率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索MLLMs如何处理视觉输入，揭示其注意力机制的稀疏性，并利用这一特性优化推理效率。

Method: 设计无训练框架量化头级视觉相关性，提出基于视觉分数的KV-Cache优化策略SparseMM。

Result: SparseMM在主流多模态基准测试中实现1.38倍实时加速和52%内存减少，同时保持性能。

Conclusion: 视觉头的稀疏性可用于高效优化MLLMs推理，SparseMM在效率和准确性间取得平衡。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are commonly derived by extending
pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) with visual capabilities. In this
work, we investigate how MLLMs process visual inputs by analyzing their
attention mechanisms. We reveal a surprising sparsity phenomenon: only a small
subset (approximately less than 5%) of attention heads in LLMs actively
contribute to visual understanding, termed visual heads. To identify these
heads efficiently, we design a training-free framework that quantifies
head-level visual relevance through targeted response analysis. Building on
this discovery, we introduce SparseMM, a KV-Cache optimization strategy that
allocates asymmetric computation budgets to heads in LLMs based on their visual
scores, leveraging the sparity of visual heads for accelerating the inference
of MLLMs. Compared with prior KV-Cache acceleration methods that ignore the
particularity of visual, SparseMM prioritizes stress and retaining visual
semantics during decoding. Extensive evaluations across mainstream multimodal
benchmarks demonstrate that SparseMM achieves superior accuracy-efficiency
trade-offs. Notably, SparseMM delivers 1.38x real-time acceleration and 52%
memory reduction during generation while maintaining performance parity on
efficiency test. Our project is open sourced at

Result: 在强间接光条件下实现最先进的3D重建，并支持视图合成、光分解和场景重光照。

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂光传输场景下的逆向渲染提供了高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: We present the first system for physically based, neural inverse rendering
from multi-viewpoint videos of propagating light. Our approach relies on a
time-resolved extension of neural radiance caching -- a technique that
accelerates inverse rendering by storing infinite-bounce radiance arriving at
any point from any direction. The resulting model accurately accounts for
direct and indirect light transport effects and, when applied to captured
measurements from a flash lidar system, enables state-of-the-art 3D
reconstruction in the presence of strong indirect light. Further, we
demonstrate view synthesis of propagating light, automatic decomposition of
captured measurements into direct and indirect components, as well as novel
capabilities such as multi-view time-resolved relighting of captured scenes.

Motivation: 现有方法在处理复杂运动场景时，由于变形场优化的困难，效果不佳。

Method: 提出FreeTimeGS，允许高斯基元在任意时间和位置出现，并赋予每个基元运动函数以减少时间冗余。

Result: 实验表明，渲染质量显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FreeTimeGS在动态3D场景重建中表现出更高的灵活性和性能。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes with
complex motions. Some recent works define 3D Gaussian primitives in the
canonical space and use deformation fields to map canonical primitives to
observation spaces, achieving real-time dynamic view synthesis. However, these
methods often struggle to handle scenes with complex motions due to the
difficulty of optimizing deformation fields. To overcome this problem, we
propose FreeTimeGS, a novel 4D representation that allows Gaussian primitives
to appear at arbitrary time and locations. In contrast to canonical Gaussian
primitives, our representation possesses the strong flexibility, thus improving
the ability to model dynamic 3D scenes. In addition, we endow each Gaussian
primitive with an motion function, allowing it to move to neighboring regions
over time, which reduces the temporal redundancy. Experiments results on
several datasets show that the rendering quality of our method outperforms
recent methods by a large margin.

TL;DR: VideoMathQA是一个评估模型在视频中进行跨模态数学推理能力的基准测试，涵盖10个数学领域，要求模型整合视觉、音频和文本信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的视频数学推理需要整合多模态信息，而现有方法在此类任务上表现不足，因此需要一个新的评估框架。

Method: 通过设计包含直接问题解决、概念迁移和深度教学理解的多样化问题，结合专家标注，构建VideoMathQA基准。

Result: VideoMathQA提供了高质量的数据集和评估框架，揭示了现有模型的局限性。

Conclusion: VideoMathQA为跨模态数学推理任务提供了系统化的评估工具，推动了模型在复杂场景中的发展。

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning in real-world video settings presents a fundamentally
different challenge than in static images or text. It requires interpreting
fine-grained visual information, accurately reading handwritten or digital
text, and integrating spoken cues, often dispersed non-linearly over time. In
such multimodal contexts, success hinges not just on perception, but on
selectively identifying and integrating the right contextual details from a
rich and noisy stream of content. To this end, we introduce VideoMathQA, a
benchmark designed to evaluate whether models can perform such temporally
extended cross-modal reasoning on videos. The benchmark spans 10 diverse
mathematical domains, covering videos ranging from 10 seconds to over 1 hour.
It requires models to interpret structured visual content, understand
instructional narratives, and jointly ground concepts across visual, audio, and
textual modalities. We employ graduate-level experts to ensure high quality,
totaling over $920$ man-hours of annotation. To reflect real-world scenarios,
questions are designed around three core reasoning challenges: direct problem
solving, where answers are grounded in the presented question; conceptual
transfer, which requires applying learned methods to new problems; and deep
instructional comprehension, involving multi-step reasoning over extended
explanations and partially worked-out solutions. Each question includes
multi-step reasoning annotations, enabling fine-grained diagnosis of model
capabilities. Through this benchmark, we highlight the limitations of existing
approaches and establish a systematic evaluation framework for models that must
reason, rather than merely perceive, across temporally extended and
modality-rich mathematical problem settings. Our benchmark and evaluation code
are available at: https://mbzuai-oryx.github.io/VideoMathQA

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种对比流匹配方法（Contrastive Flow Matching），用于解决条件设置下流匹配的模糊性问题，显著提升了训练速度、减少了去噪步骤并降低了FID。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在条件设置（如类别条件模型）中，流匹配的唯一性无法保证，导致生成结果模糊。论文旨在通过对比流匹配增强条件分离。

Method: 引入对比目标函数，最大化不同条件样本对预测流之间的差异性，从而明确区分条件流。

Result: 实验表明，对比流匹配在ImageNet-1k和CC3M基准上，训练速度提升9倍，去噪步骤减少5倍，FID降低8.9。

Conclusion: 对比流匹配有效解决了条件流匹配的模糊性问题，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Unconditional flow-matching trains diffusion models to transport samples from
a source distribution to a target distribution by enforcing that the flows
between sample pairs are unique. However, in conditional settings (e.g.,
class-conditioned models), this uniqueness is no longer guaranteed--flows from
different conditions may overlap, leading to more ambiguous generations. We
introduce Contrastive Flow Matching, an extension to the flow matching
objective that explicitly enforces uniqueness across all conditional flows,
enhancing condition separation. Our approach adds a contrastive objective that
maximizes dissimilarities between predicted flows from arbitrary sample pairs.
We validate Contrastive Flow Matching by conducting extensive experiments
across varying model architectures on both class-conditioned (ImageNet-1k) and
text-to-image (CC3M) benchmarks. Notably, we find that training models with
Contrastive Flow Matching (1) improves training speed by a factor of up to 9x,
(2) requires up to 5x fewer de-noising steps and (3) lowers FID by up to 8.9
compared to training the same models with flow matching. We release our code

TL;DR: AbBiBench是一个抗体结合亲和力成熟与设计的基准框架，通过评估抗体-抗原复合物的功能潜力，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有抗体评估方法仅关注抗体本身或其与天然抗体的相似性，缺乏对功能单元（抗体-抗原复合物）的综合评估。

Method: AbBiBench通过标准化9个数据集（含155,853个突变抗体）和14种蛋白质模型，利用模型似然与实验亲和力的相关性评估性能。

Result: 结构条件逆向折叠模型在亲和力相关性和生成任务中表现最佳。

Conclusion: AbBiBench为开发功能感知的抗体设计模型提供了统一的生物学基础评估框架。

Abstract: We introduce AbBiBench (Antibody Binding Benchmarking), a benchmarking
framework for antibody binding affinity maturation and design. Unlike existing
antibody evaluation strategies that rely on antibody alone and its similarity
to natural ones (e.g., amino acid identity rate, structural RMSD), AbBiBench
considers an antibody-antigen (Ab-Ag) complex as a functional unit and
evaluates the potential of an antibody design binding to given antigen by
measuring protein model's likelihood on the Ab-Ag complex. We first curate,
standardize, and share 9 datasets containing 9 antigens (involving influenza,
anti-lysozyme, HER2, VEGF, integrin, and SARS-CoV-2) and 155,853 heavy chain
mutated antibodies. Using these datasets, we systematically compare 14 protein
models including masked language models, autoregressive language models,
inverse folding models, diffusion-based generative models, and geometric graph
models. The correlation between model likelihood and experimental affinity
values is used to evaluate model performance. Additionally, in a case study to
increase binding affinity of antibody F045-092 to antigen influenza H1N1, we
evaluate the generative power of the top-performing models by sampling a set of
new antibodies binding to the antigen and ranking them based on structural
integrity and biophysical properties of the Ab-Ag complex. As a result,
structure-conditioned inverse folding models outperform others in both affinity
correlation and generation tasks. Overall, AbBiBench provides a unified,
biologically grounded evaluation framework to facilitate the development of
more effective, function-aware antibody design models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗数据形式多样，但可能反映相同的生理状态。通过潜在空间假设，将这些数据统一表示，可以更准确地理解疾病和个体健康状态。

Method: 利用潜在空间假设，将多模态数据映射到一个统一的几何表示中，通过编码器学习个体健康状态、疾病轨迹和治疗向量。

Result: 该框架能够揭示疾病的子轨迹和患者特异性变化方向，为个性化医疗提供定量依据。

Conclusion: 潜在空间框架为个性化医疗提供了新思路，但仍需解决数据偏见、隐私等问题，未来可通过持续学习和扰动验证等方法改进。

Abstract: Medical data range from genomic sequences and retinal photographs to
structured laboratory results and unstructured clinical narratives. Although
these modalities appear disparate, many encode convergent information about a
single underlying physiological state. The Latent Space Hypothesis frames each
observation as a projection of a unified, hierarchically organized manifold --
much like shadows cast by the same three-dimensional object. Within this
learned geometric representation, an individual's health status occupies a
point, disease progression traces a trajectory, and therapeutic intervention
corresponds to a directed vector. Interpreting heterogeneous evidence in a
shared space provides a principled way to re-examine eponymous conditions --
such as Parkinson's or Crohn's -- that often mask multiple pathophysiological
entities and involve broader anatomical domains than once believed. By
revealing sub-trajectories and patient-specific directions of change, the
framework supplies a quantitative rationale for personalised diagnosis,
longitudinal monitoring, and tailored treatment, moving clinical practice away
from grouping by potentially misleading labels toward navigation of each
person's unique trajectory. Challenges remain -- bias amplification, data
scarcity for rare disorders, privacy, and the correlation-causation divide --
but scale-aware encoders, continual learning on longitudinal data streams, and
perturbation-based validation offer plausible paths forward.

Motivation: 尽管PEFT在联邦学习中提高了隐私和训练效率，但其潜在的隐私风险尚未充分研究。本文旨在揭示PEFT机制中可能的数据泄露问题。

Method: 通过设计恶意预训练模型和适配器模块，利用梯度反转攻击从可访问的适配器梯度中重构用户的本地数据样本。

Result: 实验证明，攻击者可以高保真地恢复大批量的微调图像数据。

Conclusion: 研究强调了PEFT中隐私保护机制的必要性，并为未来研究方向提供了启示。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) allows multiple data-owners to collaboratively train
machine learning models by exchanging local gradients, while keeping their
private data on-device. To simultaneously enhance privacy and training
efficiency, recently parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of large-scale
pretrained models has gained substantial attention in FL. While keeping a
pretrained (backbone) model frozen, each user fine-tunes only a few lightweight
modules to be used in conjunction, to fit specific downstream applications.
Accordingly, only the gradients with respect to these lightweight modules are
shared with the server. In this work, we investigate how the privacy of the
fine-tuning data of the users can be compromised via a malicious design of the
pretrained model and trainable adapter modules. We demonstrate gradient
inversion attacks on a popular PEFT mechanism, the adapter, which allow an
attacker to reconstruct local data samples of a target user, using only the
accessible adapter gradients. Via extensive experiments, we demonstrate that a
large batch of fine-tuning images can be retrieved with high fidelity. Our
attack highlights the need for privacy-preserving mechanisms for PEFT, while
opening up several future directions. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的高斯噪声假设在低光成像中不适用，泊松噪声更符合实际情况，因此需要一种有效的方法处理信号依赖性噪声。

Method: 通过统一的编码器-解码器网络，结合Retinex分解和泊松去噪损失，同时增强光照和抑制噪声。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了低光条件下的可见性和亮度，同时保持了图像结构和颜色一致性。

Conclusion: 该方法在极端低光条件下有效且实用，无需先验信息即可实现高质量的图像增强。

Abstract: Low-light image denoising and enhancement are challenging, especially when
traditional noise assumptions, such as Gaussian noise, do not hold in majority.
In many real-world scenarios, such as low-light imaging, noise is
signal-dependent and is better represented as Poisson noise. In this work, we
address the problem of denoising images degraded by Poisson noise under extreme
low-light conditions. We introduce a light-weight deep learning-based method
that integrates Retinex based decomposition with Poisson denoising into a
unified encoder-decoder network. The model simultaneously enhances illumination
and suppresses noise by incorporating a Poisson denoising loss to address
signal-dependent noise. Without prior requirement for reflectance and
illumination, the network learns an effective decomposition process while
ensuring consistent reflectance and smooth illumination without causing any
form of color distortion. The experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness and practicality of the proposed low-light illumination
enhancement method. Our method significantly improves visibility and brightness
in low-light conditions, while preserving image structure and color constancy

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: DACN是一种用于高光谱图像超分辨率的双注意力卷积网络，通过多头注意力和通道-空间注意力机制解决局部依赖性和数据稀缺问题，结合优化的损失函数提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 2D CNN在高光谱图像超分辨率任务中因局部依赖性和数据稀缺性表现受限，需要全局上下文理解和更好的特征捕捉方法。

Method: DACN结合多头注意力捕捉局部和全局特征依赖，通过通道和空间注意力机制优化特征聚焦，并使用L2正则化和空间-光谱梯度损失函数。

Result: 在两个高光谱数据集上，多头注意力和通道注意力的组合表现优于单独使用任一注意力机制。

Conclusion: DACN通过双注意力机制和优化损失函数，显著提升了高光谱图像超分辨率的性能。

Abstract: 2D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have attracted significant attention
for hyperspectral image super-resolution tasks. However, a key limitation is
their reliance on local neighborhoods, which leads to a lack of global
contextual understanding. Moreover, band correlation and data scarcity continue
to limit their performance. To mitigate these issues, we introduce DACN, a
dual-attention convolutional network for hyperspectral image super-resolution.
Specifically, the model first employs augmented convolutions, integrating
multi-head attention to effectively capture both local and global feature
dependencies. Next, we infer separate attention maps for the channel and
spatial dimensions to determine where to focus across different channels and
spatial positions. Furthermore, a custom optimized loss function is proposed
that combines L2 regularization with spatial-spectral gradient loss to ensure
accurate spectral fidelity. Experimental results on two hyperspectral datasets
demonstrate that the combination of multi-head attention and channel attention
outperforms either attention mechanism used individually.

TL;DR: PixCell是一个基于扩散的生成基础模型，用于组织病理学，能够生成高质量图像，解决数据稀缺和隐私问题，并支持虚拟染色等任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决病理学中数据稀缺、隐私保护和生成任务（如虚拟染色）的挑战。

Method: 使用PanCan-30M数据集，采用渐进式训练策略和自监督条件，训练扩散模型PixCell。

Result: 生成多样且高质量的图像，可用于训练自监督模型、数据增强和教育，并支持分子标记推断。

Conclusion: PixCell为计算病理学提供了强大的生成工具，加速研究并降低数据共享的监管障碍。

Abstract: The digitization of histology slides has revolutionized pathology, providing
massive datasets for cancer diagnosis and research. Contrastive self-supervised
and vision-language models have been shown to effectively mine large pathology
datasets to learn discriminative representations. On the other hand, generative
models, capable of synthesizing realistic and diverse images, present a
compelling solution to address unique problems in pathology that involve
synthesizing images; overcoming annotated data scarcity, enabling
privacy-preserving data sharing, and performing inherently generative tasks,
such as virtual staining. We introduce PixCell, the first diffusion-based
generative foundation model for histopathology. We train PixCell on PanCan-30M,
a vast, diverse dataset derived from 69,184 H\&E-stained whole slide images
covering various cancer types. We employ a progressive training strategy and a
self-supervision-based conditioning that allows us to scale up training without
any annotated data. PixCell generates diverse and high-quality images across
multiple cancer types, which we find can be used in place of real data to train
a self-supervised discriminative model. Synthetic images shared between
institutions are subject to fewer regulatory barriers than would be the case
with real clinical images. Furthermore, we showcase the ability to precisely
control image generation using a small set of annotated images, which can be
used for both data augmentation and educational purposes. Testing on a cell
segmentation task, a mask-guided PixCell enables targeted data augmentation,
improving downstream performance. Finally, we demonstrate PixCell's ability to
use H\&E structural staining to infer results from molecular marker studies; we
use this capability to infer IHC staining from H\&E images. Our trained models
are publicly released to accelerate research in computational pathology.

*Hangyu Ji*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: DM-SegNet提出了一种双Mamba架构，通过方向性状态转换和解剖感知分层解码，解决了医学图像分割中全局上下文建模与空间拓扑保持的兼容性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学SSM在编码器-解码器兼容性上存在问题：编码器的1D序列扁平化破坏了空间结构，而传统解码器无法利用Mamba的状态传播能力。

Method: DM-SegNet采用四方向3D扫描的空间Mamba模块、门控空间卷积层和Mamba驱动的解码框架，实现双向状态同步。

Result: 在Synapse数据集上达到85.44%的DSC（腹部器官分割），在BraTS2023数据集上达到90.22%的DSC（脑肿瘤分割）。

Conclusion: DM-SegNet通过创新的双Mamba架构和解码策略，显著提升了医学图像分割的性能。

Abstract: Accurate 3D medical image segmentation demands architectures capable of
reconciling global context modeling with spatial topology preservation. While
State Space Models (SSMs) like Mamba show potential for sequence modeling,
existing medical SSMs suffer from encoder-decoder incompatibility: the
encoder's 1D sequence flattening compromises spatial structures, while
conventional decoders fail to leverage Mamba's state propagation. We present
DM-SegNet, a Dual-Mamba architecture integrating directional state transitions
with anatomy-aware hierarchical decoding. The core innovations include a
quadri-directional spatial Mamba module employing four-directional 3D scanning
to maintain anatomical spatial coherence, a gated spatial convolution layer
that enhances spatially sensitive feature representation prior to state
modeling, and a Mamba-driven decoding framework enabling bidirectional state
synchronization across scales. Extensive evaluation on two clinically
significant benchmarks demonstrates the efficacy of DM-SegNet: achieving
state-of-the-art Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 85.44% on the Synapse
dataset for abdominal organ segmentation and 90.22% on the BraTS2023 dataset
for brain tumor segmentation.

*Michael Hartisch,Leroy Chew*

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于扩展的方法（CEGAR）来解决量化整数规划（QIP）问题，并在多阶段鲁棒离散优化问题中展示了其优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: QIP结合了量化布尔公式（QBF）和整数规划的优势，但现有方法仅限于基于搜索的解法。论文旨在探索扩展方法在QIP中的应用，以提升性能。

Method: 采用反例引导的抽象精化（CEGAR）技术，将其从QBF扩展到QIP，并嵌入优化框架中。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在特定情况下优于现有的基于搜索的QIP求解器，并在线性约束建模中表现更优。

Conclusion: 扩展方法为QIP提供了新的解决方案，尤其在多阶段鲁棒优化问题中具有显著优势。

Abstract: Quantified Integer Programming (QIP) bridges multiple domains by extending
Quantified Boolean Formulas (QBF) to incorporate general integer variables and
linear constraints while also generalizing Integer Programming through variable
quantification. As a special case of Quantified Constraint Satisfaction
Problems (QCSP), QIP provides a versatile framework for addressing complex
decision-making scenarios. Additionally, the inclusion of a linear objective
function enables QIP to effectively model multistage robust discrete linear
optimization problems, making it a powerful tool for tackling uncertainty in
optimization.
  While two primary solution paradigms exist for QBF -- search-based and
expansion-based approaches -- only search-based methods have been explored for
QIP and QCSP. We introduce an expansion-based approach for QIP using
Counterexample-Guided Abstraction Refinement (CEGAR), adapting techniques from
QBF. We extend this methodology to tackle multistage robust discrete
optimization problems with linear constraints and further embed it in an
optimization framework, enhancing its applicability. Our experimental results
highlight the advantages of this approach, demonstrating superior performance
over existing search-based solvers for QIP in specific instances. Furthermore,
the ability to model problems using linear constraints enables notable
performance gains over state-of-the-art expansion-based solvers for QBF.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: 论文提出hdl2v数据集，通过将VHDL、Chisel和PyMTL3翻译为Verilog，增加公开可用的Verilog代码量，并证明其能显著提升LLM在Verilog生成任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公开可用的Verilog代码远少于其他软件语言（如Python），限制了LLM在硬件代码生成领域的潜力。

Method: 构建hdl2v数据集，将VHDL、Chisel和PyMTL3翻译为Verilog，并用于微调LLM。

Result: hdl2v使32B参数模型的性能提升23%（pass@10），数据增强方法的性能提升63%。

Conclusion: hdl2v数据集有效提升了LLM的Verilog生成能力，未来可进一步扩展数据集特性以优化性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are playing an increasingly large role in
domains such as code generation, including hardware code generation, where
Verilog is the key language. However, the amount of publicly available Verilog
code pales in comparison to the amount of code available for software languages
like Python. In this work, we present hdl2v ("HDL-to-Verilog"), a dataset which
seeks to increase the amount of available human-written Verilog data by
translating or compiling three other hardware description languages - VHDL,
Chisel, and PyMTL3 - to Verilog. Furthermore, we demonstrate the value of hdl2v
in enhancing LLM Verilog generation by improving performance of a 32
billion-parameter open-weight model by up to 23% (pass@10) in VerilogEvalV2,
without utilizing any data augmentation or knowledge distillation from larger
models. We also show hdl2v's ability to boost the performance of a data
augmentation-based fine-tuning approach by 63%. Finally, we characterize and
analyze our dataset to better understand which characteristics of
HDL-to-Verilog datasets can be expanded upon in future work for even better
performance.

TL;DR: Exp4Fuse是一种新型融合排名框架，通过零样本LLM查询扩展提升稀疏检索性能，优于现有方法并达到SOTA结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM生成文档质量依赖复杂提示策略和高计算成本的问题，探索零样本LLM查询扩展对稀疏检索的改进。

Method: 提出Exp4Fuse框架，结合原始查询和LLM增强查询的两条检索路径，采用改进的互惠排名融合方法生成最终排名。

Result: 在多个数据集上超越现有LLM查询扩展方法，结合先进稀疏检索器时达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: Exp4Fuse显著提升了稀疏检索的查询扩展效果，展示了其高效性和优越性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential in generating hypothetical
documents for query expansion, thereby enhancing information retrieval
performance. However, the efficacy of this method is highly dependent on the
quality of the generated documents, which often requires complex prompt
strategies and the integration of advanced dense retrieval techniques. This can
be both costly and computationally intensive. To mitigate these limitations, we
explore the use of zero-shot LLM-based query expansion to improve sparse
retrieval, particularly for learned sparse retrievers. We introduce a novel
fusion ranking framework, Exp4Fuse, which enhances the performance of sparse
retrievers through an indirect application of zero-shot LLM-based query
expansion. Exp4Fuse operates by simultaneously considering two retrieval
routes-one based on the original query and the other on the LLM-augmented
query. It then generates two ranked lists using a sparse retriever and fuses
them using a modified reciprocal rank fusion method. We conduct extensive
evaluations of Exp4Fuse against leading LLM-based query expansion methods and
advanced retrieval techniques on three MS MARCO-related datasets and seven
low-resource datasets. Experimental results reveal that Exp4Fuse not only
surpasses existing LLM-based query expansion methods in enhancing sparse
retrievers but also, when combined with advanced sparse retrievers, achieves
SOTA results on several benchmarks. This highlights the superior performance
and effectiveness of Exp4Fuse in improving query expansion for sparse
retrieval.

TL;DR: GOLFer是一种利用小型开源语言模型进行查询扩展的新方法，通过过滤幻觉内容和组合文档，解决了大型语言模型的高成本和计算强度问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在查询扩展中依赖模型规模，成本高且计算密集，限制了可访问性。GOLFer旨在通过小型开源语言模型解决这些问题。

Method: GOLFer包含两个模块：幻觉过滤器（检测并移除生成文档中的非事实和不一致内容）和文档组合器（通过权重向量平衡查询与过滤内容的影响）。

Result: 在三个网页搜索和十个低资源数据集上的实验表明，GOLFer优于其他使用小型语言模型的方法，并与大型LLM方法保持竞争力。

Conclusion: GOLFer证明了小型语言模型在查询扩展中的有效性，为资源受限的场景提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs)-based query expansion for information retrieval
augments queries with generated hypothetical documents with LLMs. However, its
performance relies heavily on the scale of the language models (LMs),
necessitating larger, more advanced LLMs. This approach is costly,
computationally intensive, and often has limited accessibility. To address
these limitations, we introduce GOLFer - Smaller LMs-Generated Documents
Hallucination Filter & Combiner - a novel method leveraging smaller open-source
LMs for query expansion. GOLFer comprises two modules: a hallucination filter
and a documents combiner. The former detects and removes non-factual and
inconsistent sentences in generated documents, a common issue with smaller LMs,
while the latter combines the filtered content with the query using a weight
vector to balance their influence. We evaluate GOLFer alongside dominant
LLM-based query expansion methods on three web search and ten low-resource
datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that GOLFer consistently outperforms
other methods using smaller LMs, and maintains competitive performance against
methods using large-size LLMs, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 论文研究了减少视觉文档检索（VDR）中每页的补丁嵌入数量的方法，提出了两种策略：令牌修剪和令牌合并。发现随机修剪效果优于复杂方法，但合并策略更适合VDR，最终开发了Light-ColPali/ColQwen2，显著降低了内存占用且性能损失极小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ColPali/ColQwen2在VDR中表现优异，但每页生成多个补丁级嵌入导致内存占用过高，研究旨在减少嵌入数量并最小化性能损失。

Method: 评估了令牌修剪和令牌合并两种策略，发现修剪不适合VDR，转而优化合并策略，开发了Light-ColPali/ColQwen2。

Result: Light-ColPali/ColQwen2在仅11.8%内存占用下保持98.2%检索性能，2.8%内存占用下保留94.6%效果。

Conclusion: 研究结果为高效VDR提供了有价值的见解和竞争性基线，Light-ColPali/ColQwen2是未来研究的参考。

Abstract: Despite the strong performance of ColPali/ColQwen2 in Visualized Document
Retrieval (VDR), it encodes each page into multiple patch-level embeddings and
leads to excessive memory usage. This empirical study investigates methods to
reduce patch embeddings per page at minimum performance degradation. We
evaluate two token-reduction strategies: token pruning and token merging.
Regarding token pruning, we surprisingly observe that a simple random strategy
outperforms other sophisticated pruning methods, though still far from
satisfactory. Further analysis reveals that pruning is inherently unsuitable
for VDR as it requires removing certain page embeddings without query-specific
information. Turning to token merging (more suitable for VDR), we search for
the optimal combinations of merging strategy across three dimensions and
develop Light-ColPali/ColQwen2. It maintains 98.2% of retrieval performance
with only 11.8% of original memory usage, and preserves 94.6% effectiveness at
2.8% memory footprint. We expect our empirical findings and resulting
Light-ColPali/ColQwen2 offer valuable insights and establish a competitive
baseline for future research towards efficient VDR.

TL;DR: R2Rec是一个基于大语言模型（LLM）的推荐框架，通过逐步推理链模拟用户决策过程，显著提升了推荐效果和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM推理方法在推荐任务中效果不佳，因为用户反馈是隐式的且缺乏明确的推理监督。

Method: R2Rec通过采样用户-物品交互链，将其转化为结构化推理链，采用渐进式掩码提示策略，并结合监督微调和强化学习进行训练。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上，R2Rec在HitRatio@1上平均提升10.48%，比原始LLM提升131.81%，且推理链增强了可解释性。

Conclusion: R2Rec通过模拟逐步推理有效解决了推荐任务中的隐式反馈问题，显著提升了性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Driven by advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), integrating them into
recommendation tasks has gained interest due to their strong semantic
understanding and prompt flexibility. Prior work encoded user-item interactions
or metadata into prompts for recommendations. In parallel, LLM reasoning,
boosted by test-time scaling and reinforcement learning, has excelled in fields
like mathematics and code, where reasoning traces and correctness signals are
clear, enabling high performance and interpretability. However, directly
applying these reasoning methods to recommendation is ineffective because user
feedback is implicit and lacks reasoning supervision. To address this, we
propose $\textbf{R2Rec}$, a reasoning-enhanced recommendation framework that
samples interaction chains from the user-item graph and converts them into
structured interaction-of-thoughts via a progressive masked prompting strategy,
with each thought representing stepwise reasoning grounded in interaction
context. This allows LLMs to simulate step-by-step decision-making based on
implicit patterns. We design a two-stage training pipeline: supervised
fine-tuning teaches basic reasoning from high-quality traces, and reinforcement
learning refines reasoning via reward signals, alleviating sparse explicit
supervision. Experiments on three real-world datasets show R2Rec outperforms
classical and LLM-based baselines with an average $\textbf{10.48%}$ improvement
in HitRatio@1 and $\textbf{131.81%}$ gain over the original LLM. Furthermore,
the explicit reasoning chains enhance interpretability by revealing the
decision process. Our code is available at:

Conclusion: 尽管存在数据共享和重用的挑战，计算密集型二次分析为定性数据提供了新的研究机会。

Abstract: This paper draws attention to the potential of computational methods in
reworking data generated in past qualitative studies. While qualitative
inquiries often produce rich data through rigorous and resource-intensive
processes, much of this data usually remains unused. In this paper, we first
make a general case for secondary analysis of qualitative data by discussing
its benefits, distinctions, and epistemological aspects. We then argue for
opportunities with computationally intensive secondary analysis, highlighting
the possibility of drawing on data assemblages spanning multiple contexts and
timeframes to address cross-contextual and longitudinal research phenomena and
questions. We propose a scheme to perform computationally intensive secondary
analysis and advance ideas on how this approach can help facilitate the
development of innovative research designs. Finally, we enumerate some key
challenges and ongoing concerns associated with qualitative data sharing and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频-文本模型在背景声源存在时性能显著下降，研究发现这种退化主要由背景声的信噪比（SNR）驱动，与背景类型无关。

Method: 提出了一种量化背景声源贡献的方法，并将其整合到分类过程中，同时分析了音频与文本嵌入之间的模态差距。

Result: 该方法在不同背景和SNR条件下提升了分类准确性，且适用于多种先进的典型方法。

Conclusion: 该方法具有可扩展性和鲁棒性，适用于多样化环境。

Abstract: Audio-text models are widely used in zero-shot environmental sound
classification as they alleviate the need for annotated data. However, we show
that their performance severely drops in the presence of background sound
sources. Our analysis reveals that this degradation is primarily driven by SNR
levels of background soundscapes, and independent of background type. To
address this, we propose a novel method that quantifies and integrates the
contribution of background sources into the classification process, improving
performance without requiring model retraining. Our domain adaptation technique
enhances accuracy across various backgrounds and SNR conditions. Moreover, we
analyze the modality gap between audio and text embeddings, showing that
narrowing this gap improves classification performance. The method generalizes
effectively across state-of-the-art prototypical approaches, showcasing its
scalability and robustness for diverse environments.

Motivation: 现有方法仅通过微调预训练ASR模型生成标签，缺乏与字素的直接关联，限制了标签的一致性和下游任务的应用。

Method: 1) 使用预训练BERT特征通过提示编码器隐式引入字素条件；2) 在推理阶段显式剪枝与字素不一致的标签假设。

Conclusion: 所提方法通过结合隐式和显式条件，成功生成与字素一致的标签数据，适用于多种下游任务。

Abstract: We propose a model to obtain phonemic and prosodic labels of speech that are
coherent with graphemes. Unlike previous methods that simply fine-tune a
pre-trained ASR model with the labels, the proposed model conditions the label
generation on corresponding graphemes by two methods: 1) Add implicit grapheme
conditioning through prompt encoder using pre-trained BERT features. 2)
Explicitly prune the label hypotheses inconsistent with the grapheme during
inference. These methods enable obtaining parallel data of speech, the labels,
and graphemes, which is applicable to various downstream tasks such as
text-to-speech and accent estimation from text. Experiments showed that the
proposed method significantly improved the consistency between graphemes and
the predicted labels. Further, experiments on accent estimation task confirmed
that the created parallel data by the proposed method effectively improve the
estimation accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的WFST解码方法在音素基础的ASR中存在流程复杂且无法利用大语言模型的限制，因此需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 提出了LLM-P2G解码方法，包括语音到音素（S2P）和音素到字素（P2G）两部分，并通过数据增强（DANP）和随机化训练（TKM）策略优化。

Result: 在波兰语和德语的跨语言ASR中，LLM-P2G相比WFST系统分别实现了3.6%和6.9%的相对WER降低。

Conclusion: LLM-P2G在音素基础的ASR中表现优异，为跨语言任务提供了一种高效的解码方案。

Abstract: In automatic speech recognition (ASR), phoneme-based multilingual
pre-training and crosslingual fine-tuning is attractive for its high data
efficiency and competitive results compared to subword-based models. However,
Weighted Finite State Transducer (WFST) based decoding is limited by its
complex pipeline and inability to leverage large language models (LLMs).
Therefore, we propose LLM-based phoneme-to-grapheme (LLM-P2G) decoding for
phoneme-based ASR, consisting of speech-to-phoneme (S2P) and
phoneme-to-grapheme (P2G). A challenge is that there seems to have information
loss in cascading S2P and P2G. To address this challenge, we propose two
training strategies: data augmentation with noisy phonemes (DANP), and
randomized top-$K$ marginalized (TKM) training and decoding. Our experimental
results show that LLM-P2G outperforms WFST-based systems in crosslingual ASR
for Polish and German, by relative WER reductions of 3.6% and 6.9%
respectively.

Abstract: Effective teamwork is essential across diverse domains. During the team
formation stage, a key challenge is forming teams that effectively balance user
preferences with task objectives to enhance overall team satisfaction. In the
team performing stage, maintaining cohesion and engagement is critical for
sustaining high team performance. However, existing computational tools and
algorithms for team optimization often rely on static data inputs, narrow
algorithmic objectives, or solutions tailored for specific contexts, failing to
account for the dynamic interplay of team members personalities, evolving
goals, and changing individual preferences. Therefore, teams may encounter
member dissatisfaction, as purely algorithmic assignments can reduce members
commitment to team goals or experience suboptimal engagement due to the absence
of timely, personalized guidance to help members adjust their behaviors and
interactions as team dynamics evolve. Ultimately, these challenges can lead to
reduced overall team performance. My Ph.D. dissertation aims to develop
AI-augmented team optimization frameworks and practical systems that enhance
team satisfaction, engagement, and performance. First, I propose a team
formation framework that leverages a multi-armed bandit algorithm to
iteratively refine team composition based on user preferences, ensuring
alignment between individual needs and collective team goals to enhance team
satisfaction. Second, I introduce tAIfa (Team AI Feedback Assistant), an
AI-powered system that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to deliver
immediate, personalized feedback to both teams and individual members,
enhancing cohesion and engagement. Finally, I present PuppeteerLLM, an
LLM-based simulation framework that simulates multi-agent teams to model
complex team dynamics within realistic environments, incorporating task-driven
collaboration and long-term coordination.

### [278] [A Multi-Dataset Evaluation of Models for Automated Vulnerability Repair](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04987)
*Zanis Ali Khan,Aayush Garg,Qiang Tang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了预训练语言模型CodeBERT和CodeT5在自动漏洞修复中的表现，发现CodeBERT在上下文稀疏时表现更好，而CodeT5在复杂漏洞模式识别和可扩展性上更优。微调模型在已知数据上表现提升，但在未知数据上泛化能力有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软件漏洞对安全构成重大威胁，但自动漏洞修复（APR）中的漏洞修补研究不足。本研究旨在探索预训练语言模型在漏洞修复中的潜力。

Method: 使用CodeBERT和CodeT5模型，在六个数据集和四种语言上进行自动漏洞修复实验，评估其准确性和泛化能力。

Result: CodeBERT在上下文稀疏时表现较好，CodeT5在复杂漏洞模式和可扩展性上更优。微调模型在已知数据上表现提升，但在未知数据上泛化能力有限。

Conclusion: 研究为自动漏洞修复提供了基准，揭示了模型泛化的局限性，并提出了改进方向，以推动实际安全应用。

Abstract: Software vulnerabilities pose significant security threats, requiring
effective mitigation. While Automated Program Repair (APR) has advanced in
fixing general bugs, vulnerability patching, a security-critical aspect of APR
remains underexplored. This study investigates pre-trained language models,
CodeBERT and CodeT5, for automated vulnerability patching across six datasets
and four languages. We evaluate their accuracy and generalization to unknown
vulnerabilities. Results show that while both models face challenges with
fragmented or sparse context, CodeBERT performs comparatively better in such
scenarios, whereas CodeT5 excels in capturing complex vulnerability patterns.
CodeT5 also demonstrates superior scalability. Furthermore, we test fine-tuned
models on both in-distribution (trained) and out-of-distribution (unseen)
datasets. While fine-tuning improves in-distribution performance, models
struggle to generalize to unseen data, highlighting challenges in robust
vulnerability detection. This study benchmarks model performance, identifies
limitations in generalization, and provides actionable insights to advance
automated vulnerability patching for real-world security applications.

*Junpyo Seo,Hanbin Koo,Jieun Yook,Byung-Ro Moon*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散模型的动漫风格面部草图自动上色框架，通过SSIMBaD技术实现结构保真和风格迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖预定义噪声调度，可能影响感知一致性，因此需要一种更平衡且忠实重建的方法。

Method: 采用连续时间扩散模型，引入SSIMBaD技术，通过sigma空间变换对齐感知退化。

Result: 在大规模动漫面部数据集上，该方法在像素精度和感知质量上优于现有模型，并能适应多样风格。

Conclusion: SSIMBaD框架在动漫面部上色任务中表现出色，兼具高精度和泛化能力。

Abstract: We propose a novel diffusion-based framework for automatic colorization of
Anime-style facial sketches. Our method preserves the structural fidelity of
the input sketch while effectively transferring stylistic attributes from a
reference image. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on predefined noise
schedules - which often compromise perceptual consistency -- our framework
builds on continuous-time diffusion models and introduces SSIMBaD (Sigma
Scaling with SSIM-Guided Balanced Diffusion). SSIMBaD applies a sigma-space
transformation that aligns perceptual degradation, as measured by structural
similarity (SSIM), in a linear manner. This scaling ensures uniform visual
difficulty across timesteps, enabling more balanced and faithful
reconstructions. Experiments on a large-scale Anime face dataset demonstrate
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art models in both pixel accuracy and
perceptual quality, while generalizing to diverse styles. Code is available at

### [280] [Handle-based Mesh Deformation Guided By Vision Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04562)
*Xingpeng Sun,Shiyang Jia,Zherong Pan,Kui Wu,Aniket Bera*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练、基于手柄的网格变形方法，利用视觉语言模型（VLM）通过提示工程实现高质量变形。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有网格变形方法存在输出质量低、需手动调参或依赖数据训练的问题，需改进。

Method: 结合锥形奇点检测和VLM，通过多视角投票减少不确定性，实现自动化变形。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，方法更符合用户意图，变形质量高且失真低。

Conclusion: 该方法无需训练、自动化程度高，能稳定生成高质量网格变形。

Abstract: Mesh deformation is a fundamental tool in 3D content manipulation. Despite
extensive prior research, existing approaches often suffer from low output
quality, require significant manual tuning, or depend on data-intensive
training. To address these limitations, we introduce a training-free,
handle-based mesh deformation method. % Our core idea is to leverage a
Vision-Language Model (VLM) to interpret and manipulate a handle-based
interface through prompt engineering. We begin by applying cone singularity
detection to identify a sparse set of potential handles. The VLM is then
prompted to select both the deformable sub-parts of the mesh and the handles
that best align with user instructions. Subsequently, we query the desired
deformed positions of the selected handles in screen space. To reduce
uncertainty inherent in VLM predictions, we aggregate the results from multiple
camera views using a novel multi-view voting scheme. % Across a suite of
benchmarks, our method produces deformations that align more closely with user
intent, as measured by CLIP and GPTEval3D scores, while introducing low
distortion -- quantified via membrane energy. In summary, our approach is
training-free, highly automated, and consistently delivers high-quality mesh
deformations.

### [281] [VoxDet: Rethinking 3D Semantic Occupancy Prediction as Dense Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04623)
*Wuyang Li,Zhu Yu,Alexandre Alahi*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种实例中心化的3D语义占用预测框架VoxDet，通过将体素级标签转换为实例级偏移标签，并解耦为偏移回归和语义预测两个子任务，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将3D语义占用预测视为密集分割任务，忽视了实例级的区分性，导致实例不完整和相邻模糊。论文发现体素级标签隐含实例级信息，提出利用这一免费信息改进预测。

Method: 提出VoxDet框架，包括：(a)空间解耦体素编码器生成任务特定特征，(b)任务解耦密集预测器通过偏移回归和语义预测实现实例感知预测。

Result: VoxDet在相机和LiDAR输入下均达到SOTA，SemanticKITTI测试集上IoU为63.0，排名第一。

Conclusion: VoxDet通过实例中心化设计显著提升了3D语义占用预测的性能和效率。

Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction aims to reconstruct the 3D geometry and
semantics of the surrounding environment. With dense voxel labels, prior works
typically formulate it as a dense segmentation task, independently classifying
each voxel. However, this paradigm neglects critical instance-centric
discriminability, leading to instance-level incompleteness and adjacent
ambiguities. To address this, we highlight a free lunch of occupancy labels:
the voxel-level class label implicitly provides insight at the instance level,
which is overlooked by the community. Motivated by this observation, we first
introduce a training-free Voxel-to-Instance (VoxNT) trick: a simple yet
effective method that freely converts voxel-level class labels into
instance-level offset labels. Building on this, we further propose VoxDet, an
instance-centric framework that reformulates the voxel-level occupancy
prediction as dense object detection by decoupling it into two sub-tasks:
offset regression and semantic prediction. Specifically, based on the lifted 3D
volume, VoxDet first uses (a) Spatially-decoupled Voxel Encoder to generate
disentangled feature volumes for the two sub-tasks, which learn task-specific
spatial deformation in the densely projected tri-perceptive space. Then, we
deploy (b) Task-decoupled Dense Predictor to address this task via dense
detection. Here, we first regress a 4D offset field to estimate distances (6
directions) between voxels and object borders in the voxel space. The regressed
offsets are then used to guide the instance-level aggregation in the
classification branch, achieving instance-aware prediction. Experiments show
that VoxDet can be deployed on both camera and LiDAR input, jointly achieving
state-of-the-art results on both benchmarks. VoxDet is not only highly
efficient, but also achieves 63.0 IoU on the SemanticKITTI test set, ranking
1st on the online leaderboard.

### [282] [A Fast Unsupervised Scheme for Polygonal Approximation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04664)
*Bimal Kumar Ray*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了一种快速且无监督的多边形逼近闭合数字曲线的方案，速度优于现有技术，并在Rosin度量及美观性上具有竞争力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有多边形逼近方法速度慢且可能忽略低曲率重要顶点的问题。

Method: 方案分为三阶段：初始分割检测高曲率顶点，迭代顶点插入补充低曲率顶点，迭代合并消除冗余顶点，最后调整顶点优化美观性。

Result: 方案在速度、Rosin度量和美观性上表现优异，且对几何变换具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方案为闭合数字曲线提供了一种高效且美观的多边形逼近方法。

Abstract: This paper proposes a fast and unsupervised scheme for a polygonal
approximation of a closed digital curve. It is demonstrated that the
approximation scheme is faster than state-of-the-art approximation and is
competitive with the same in Rosin's measure and in its aesthetic aspect. The
scheme comprises of three phases: initial segmentation, iterative vertex
insertion, and iterative merging, followed by vertex adjustment. The initial
segmentation is used to detect sharp turnings - the vertices that seemingly
have high curvature. It is likely that some of important vertices with low
curvature might have been missed out at the first phase and so iterative vertex
insertion is used to add vertices in a region where the curvature changes
slowly but steadily. The initial phase may pick up some undesirable vertices
and so merging is used to eliminate the redundant vertices. Finally, vertex
adjustment is used to facilitate enhancement in the aesthetic look of the
approximation. The quality of the approximations is measured using Rosin's
measure. The robustness of the proposed scheme with respect to geometric
transformation is observed.

### [283] [Can we reconstruct a dysarthric voice with the large speech model Parler TTS?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04397)
*Ariadna Sanchez,Simon King*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 论文探讨了利用大型语音模型Parler TTS为构音障碍患者重建声音的可能性，发现模型能生成可理解的语音，但在控制清晰度和保持说话者身份一致性方面存在困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构音障碍使沟通变得困难甚至不可能，个性化文本转语音（TTS）作为一种沟通辅助工具具有吸引力。

Method: 使用Parler TTS模型，通过收集并标注相关数据集来微调模型，尝试重建构音障碍患者的声音。

Result: 模型能够从挑战性数据中学习生成语音，但在控制清晰度和说话者身份一致性方面表现不佳。

Conclusion: 未来研究方向是改进此类模型在声音重建任务中的可控性。

Abstract: Speech disorders can make communication hard or even impossible for those who
develop them. Personalised Text-to-Speech is an attractive option as a
communication aid. We attempt voice reconstruction using a large speech model,
with which we generate an approximation of a dysarthric speaker's voice prior
to the onset of their condition. In particular, we investigate whether a
state-of-the-art large speech model, Parler TTS, can generate intelligible
speech while maintaining speaker identity. We curate a dataset and annotate it
with relevant speaker and intelligibility information, and use this to
fine-tune the model. Our results show that the model can indeed learn to
generate from the distribution of this challenging data, but struggles to
control intelligibility and to maintain consistent speaker identity. We propose
future directions to improve controllability of this class of model, for the
voice reconstruction task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究联合语音-文本解码策略对性能、效率和对齐质量的影响。

Method: 系统比较交错和平行生成范式，提出ESI模式，并使用高质量QA数据集。

Result: 交错方法对齐最佳但推理慢，ESI模式加速解码且性能略优。

Conclusion: ESI模式是高效且性能优越的解码策略，适用于语音问答任务。

Abstract: Speech language models (Speech LMs) enable end-to-end speech-text modelling
within a single model, offering a promising direction for spoken dialogue
systems. The choice of speech-text jointly decoding paradigm plays a critical
role in performance, efficiency, and alignment quality. In this work, we
systematically compare representative joint speech-text decoding
strategies-including the interleaved, and parallel generation paradigms-under a
controlled experimental setup using the same base language model, speech
tokenizer and training data. Our results show that the interleaved approach
achieves the best alignment. However it suffers from slow inference due to long
token sequence length. To address this, we propose a novel early-stop
interleaved (ESI) pattern that not only significantly accelerates decoding but
also yields slightly better performance. Additionally, we curate high-quality
question answering (QA) datasets to further improve speech QA performance.

Motivation: 语音情感识别系统存在性别偏见，但现有去偏方法在多标签场景中的效果和鲁棒性尚未充分研究。

Method: 研究比较了13种去偏方法，包括预处理、正则化、对抗学习、偏见学习器和分布鲁棒优化，使用WavLM和XLSR表征在性别不平衡条件下进行实验。

Result: 量化了公平性与准确性的权衡，发现某些方法能持续减少性别性能差距而不影响整体性能。

Conclusion: 研究为选择有效去偏策略提供了实用建议，并揭示了数据集分布的影响。

Abstract: Speech emotion recognition (SER) systems often exhibit gender bias. However,
the effectiveness and robustness of existing debiasing methods in such
multi-label scenarios remain underexplored. To address this gap, we present
EMO-Debias, a large-scale comparison of 13 debiasing methods applied to
multi-label SER. Our study encompasses techniques from pre-processing,
regularization, adversarial learning, biased learners, and distributionally
robust optimization. Experiments conducted on acted and naturalistic emotion
datasets, using WavLM and XLSR representations, evaluate each method under
conditions of gender imbalance. Our analysis quantifies the trade-offs between
fairness and accuracy, identifying which approaches consistently reduce gender
performance gaps without compromising overall model performance. The findings
provide actionable insights for selecting effective debiasing strategies and
highlight the impact of dataset distributions.

TL;DR: 研究发现，现有的NLP工具在测量大型语言模型（LLM）的表征危害时，未能充分满足实践者的需求，主要因工具不实用或存在实际障碍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨公开可用的NLP工具是否满足实践者在评估LLM系统时的需求。

Method: 通过半结构化访谈12名实践者，分析工具的适用性。

Result: 实践者常无法使用现有工具，因工具不实用或存在实际障碍。

Conclusion: 建议基于测量理论和实用测量改进工具，以更好地满足实践者需求。

Abstract: The NLP research community has made publicly available numerous instruments
for measuring representational harms caused by large language model (LLM)-based
systems. These instruments have taken the form of datasets, metrics, tools, and
more. In this paper, we examine the extent to which such instruments meet the
needs of practitioners tasked with evaluating LLM-based systems. Via
semi-structured interviews with 12 such practitioners, we find that
practitioners are often unable to use publicly available instruments for
measuring representational harms. We identify two types of challenges. In some
cases, instruments are not useful because they do not meaningfully measure what
practitioners seek to measure or are otherwise misaligned with practitioner
needs. In other cases, instruments - even useful instruments - are not used by
practitioners due to practical and institutional barriers impeding their
uptake. Drawing on measurement theory and pragmatic measurement, we provide
recommendations for addressing these challenges to better meet practitioner
needs.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了代理型AI系统对传统公共部门监督机制的挑战，提出了五个关键治理维度，并通过混合方法研究发现现有监督结构难以应对这些挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于代理型AI系统的引入加剧了传统监督机制的不足，需探索新的治理方法以适应公共部门需求。

Method: 采用混合方法，包括文献综述和对AI相关公务员的访谈，评估现有监督结构的适应性。

Result: 发现代理监督加剧了三个现有治理挑战：持续监督、治理与运营能力的深度融合以及跨部门协调。

Conclusion: 提出适应公共部门限制的代理监督方法，包括调整制度结构和设计兼容的监督机制。

Abstract: This paper finds that the introduction of agentic AI systems intensifies
existing challenges to traditional public sector oversight mechanisms -- which
rely on siloed compliance units and episodic approvals rather than continuous,
integrated supervision. We identify five governance dimensions essential for
responsible agent deployment: cross-departmental implementation, comprehensive
evaluation, enhanced security protocols, operational visibility, and systematic
auditing. We evaluate the capacity of existing oversight structures to meet
these challenges, via a mixed-methods approach consisting of a literature
review and interviews with civil servants in AI-related roles. We find that
agent oversight poses intensified versions of three existing governance
challenges: continuous oversight, deeper integration of governance and
operational capabilities, and interdepartmental coordination. We propose
approaches that both adapt institutional structures and design agent oversight
compatible with public sector constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战将第一修正案保护应用于AI模型输出的假设，探讨其对社会和法律的潜在影响。

Method: 通过法律先例和言论自由的基本原则，分析AI模型输出的性质及其与第一修正案的兼容性。

Result: AI模型输出因缺乏意图性不构成言论，赋予保护会妨碍政府监管，增加社会风险。

Conclusion: 不应将第一修正案保护扩展到AI模型输出，以避免监管障碍和社会危害。

Abstract: This paper challenges the assumption that courts should grant First Amendment
protections to outputs from large generative AI models, such as GPT-4 and
Gemini. We argue that because these models lack intentionality, their outputs
do not constitute speech as understood in the context of established legal
precedent, so there can be no speech to protect. Furthermore, if the model
outputs are not speech, users cannot claim a First Amendment speech right to
receive the outputs. We also argue that extending First Amendment rights to AI
models would not serve the fundamental purposes of free speech, such as
promoting a marketplace of ideas, facilitating self-governance, or fostering
self-expression. In fact, granting First Amendment protections to AI models
would be detrimental to society because it would hinder the government's
ability to regulate these powerful technologies effectively, potentially
leading to the unchecked spread of misinformation and other harms.

Abstract: While many neural networks focus on layers to process information, the GAIN
model uses a grid-based structure to improve biological plausibility and the
dynamics of the model. The grid structure helps neurons to interact with their
closest neighbors and improve their connections with one another, which is seen
in biological neurons. While also being implemented with the Izhikevich model
this approach allows for a computationally efficient and biologically accurate
simulation that can aid in the development of neural networks, large scale

the Izhikevich model can improve the dynamics and accuracy of the model,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM在检测上下文无关虚假信息时，难以捕捉图像与文本间的深层语义关联，且证据噪声影响准确性。

Method: 提出CMIE框架，包含共存关系生成（CRG）策略和关联评分（AS）机制，识别图像与文本的共存关系并选择性利用证据。

Result: 实验表明CMIE优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CMIE通过深层语义关联和噪声过滤，有效提升了虚假信息检测的准确性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in visual reasoning and text generation. While previous studies
have explored the application of MLLM for detecting out-of-context (OOC)
misinformation, our empirical analysis reveals two persisting challenges of
this paradigm. Evaluating the representative GPT-4o model on direct reasoning
and evidence augmented reasoning, results indicate that MLLM struggle to
capture the deeper relationships-specifically, cases in which the image and
text are not directly connected but are associated through underlying semantic
links. Moreover, noise in the evidence further impairs detection accuracy. To
address these challenges, we propose CMIE, a novel OOC misinformation detection
framework that incorporates a Coexistence Relationship Generation (CRG)
strategy and an Association Scoring (AS) mechanism. CMIE identifies the
underlying coexistence relationships between images and text, and selectively
utilizes relevant evidence to enhance misinformation detection. Experimental
results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods.

TL;DR: BEAR是一个利用大型语言模型（LLM）自动生成BGP异常事件报告的框架，通过多步推理将表格数据转化为详细文本，提升解释性和分析精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BGP异常（如路由泄漏和劫持）威胁网络可靠性和安全，现有方法需专家解读，BEAR旨在自动化这一过程。

Method: BEAR结合LLM和多步推理，将BGP数据转化为文本报告，并利用LLM生成合成数据以弥补公开数据不足。

Result: 在真实和合成数据集上，BEAR实现100%准确率，优于Chain-of-Thought和上下文学习基线。

Conclusion: BEAR开创了自动化解释BGP异常事件的先河，为网络管理提供实用洞察。

Abstract: The Internet comprises of interconnected, independently managed Autonomous
Systems (AS) that rely on the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) for inter-domain
routing. BGP anomalies--such as route leaks and hijacks--can divert traffic
through unauthorized or inefficient paths, jeopardizing network reliability and
security. Although existing rule-based and machine learning methods can detect
these anomalies using structured metrics, they still require experts with
in-depth BGP knowledge of, for example, AS relationships and historical
incidents, to interpret events and propose remediation. In this paper, we
introduce BEAR (BGP Event Analysis and Reporting), a novel framework that
leverages large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate comprehensive
reports explaining detected BGP anomaly events. BEAR employs a multi-step
reasoning process that translates tabular BGP data into detailed textual
narratives, enhancing interpretability and analytical precision. To address the
limited availability of publicly documented BGP anomalies, we also present a
synthetic data generation framework powered by LLMs. Evaluations on both real
and synthetic datasets demonstrate that BEAR achieves 100% accuracy,
outperforming Chain-of-Thought and in-context learning baselines. This work
pioneers an automated approach for explaining BGP anomaly events, offering
valuable operational insights for network management.

Motivation: WiFi 7的MLO功能在密集网络中面临信道分配难题，现有研究多关注静态网络，而本文旨在解决动态环境下的优化问题。

Method: 将问题建模为组合优化，采用多臂老虎机框架，提出BAI-MCTS算法，并进一步结合LLM提出LLM-BAI-MCTS算法。

Conclusion: 提出的算法在动态信道分配中表现出色，为密集WiFi 7网络提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: WiFi networks have achieved remarkable success in enabling seamless
communication and data exchange worldwide. The IEEE 802.11be standard, known as
WiFi 7, introduces Multi-Link Operation (MLO), a groundbreaking feature that
enables devices to establish multiple simultaneous connections across different
bands and channels. While MLO promises substantial improvements in network
throughput and latency reduction, it presents significant challenges in channel
allocation, particularly in dense network environments. Current research has
predominantly focused on performance analysis and throughput optimization
within static WiFi 7 network configurations. In contrast, this paper addresses
the dynamic channel allocation problem in dense WiFi 7 networks with MLO
capabilities. We formulate this challenge as a combinatorial optimization
problem, leveraging a novel network performance analysis mechanism. Given the
inherent lack of prior network information, we model the problem within a
Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework to enable online learning of optimal channel
allocations. Our proposed Best-Arm Identification-enabled Monte Carlo Tree
Search (BAI-MCTS) algorithm includes rigorous theoretical analysis, providing
upper bounds for both sample complexity and error probability. To further
reduce sample complexity and enhance generalizability across diverse network
scenarios, we put forth LLM-BAI-MCTS, an intelligent algorithm for the dynamic
channel allocation problem by integrating the Large Language Model (LLM) into
the BAI-MCTS algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that the BAI-MCTS
algorithm achieves a convergence rate approximately $50.44\%$ faster than the
state-of-the-art algorithms when reaching $98\%$ of the optimal value. Notably,
the convergence rate of the LLM-BAI-MCTS algorithm increases by over $63.32\%$
in dense networks.

Motivation: 移动网络运营商在数据利用上落后于OTT企业，需通过数据分析提升价值。3GPP的NWDAF提供了数据分析和预测能力，但学术研究局限于有限方法和用例。

Method: 分析70多篇文献，识别趋势和差距，并提出两个新的NWDAF用例。

Result: 揭示了NWDAF在提升服务、优化运营和降低风险方面的潜力，同时指出学术研究的局限性。

Conclusion: 通过新用例推动NWDAF的采用，探索其商业化潜力，为移动网络运营商创造更大价值。

Abstract: Data has become a critical asset in the digital economy, yet it remains
underutilized by Mobile Network Operators (MNOs), unlike Over-the-Top (OTT)
players that lead global market valuations. To move beyond the commoditization
of connectivity and deliver greater value to customers, data analytics emerges
as a strategic enabler. Using data efficiently is essential for unlocking new
service opportunities, optimizing operational efficiency, and mitigating
operational and business risks. Since Release 15, the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP) has introduced the Network Data Analytics Function
(NWDAF) to provide powerful insights and predictions using data collected
across mobile networks, supporting both user-centric and network-oriented use
cases. However, academic research has largely focused on a limited set of
methods and use cases, driven by the availability of datasets, restricting
broader exploration. This study analyzes trends and gaps in more than 70
articles and proposes two novel use cases to promote the adoption of NWDAF and
explore its potential for monetization.

*Jiayu Wang,Aws Albarghouthi,Frederic Sala*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: COSMOS是一个预测框架，用于高效估计大型语言模型（LLM）的适应策略性能和成本，减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在资源受限的情况下，如何最优选择LLM及其适应策略是一个挑战，通常需要大量实验。

Method: 引入COSMOS框架，结合嵌入增强的轻量级代理模型和低样本缩放法则，预测微调性能和检索增强的上下文学习。

Result: 在八个基准测试中，COSMOS平均减少计算成本92.72%，最高达98.71%，同时保持高预测准确性。

Conclusion: 高效预测LLM适应策略的可行性，显著降低计算开销，同时维持性能标准。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance across numerous
tasks by using a diverse array of adaptation strategies. However, optimally
selecting a model and adaptation strategy under resource constraints is
challenging and often requires extensive experimentation. We investigate
whether it is possible to accurately predict both performance and cost without
expensive trials. We formalize the strategy selection problem for LLMs and
introduce COSMOS, a unified prediction framework that efficiently estimates
adaptation outcomes at minimal cost. We instantiate and study the capability of
our framework via a pair of powerful predictors: embedding-augmented
lightweight proxy models to predict fine-tuning performance, and low-sample
scaling laws to forecast retrieval-augmented in-context learning. Extensive
evaluation across eight representative benchmarks demonstrates that COSMOS
achieves high prediction accuracy while reducing computational costs by 92.72%
on average, and up to 98.71% in resource-intensive scenarios. Our results show
that efficient prediction of adaptation outcomes is not only feasible but can
substantially reduce the computational overhead of LLM deployment while
maintaining performance standards.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于概念的模型因其可解释性在医疗诊断和金融风险预测等关键领域受到关注，但其结构、训练和对抗性漏洞等问题限制了其可靠性和泛化能力，需要系统研究。

Method: 通过综合调查，总结了基于概念的模型在监督和无监督范式下的常见挑战及缓解架构选择，并分析了提高其可靠性的最新进展。

Conclusion: 本文为基于概念的模型的研究提供了系统综述，指出了未来研究的开放问题和潜在方向。

Abstract: Concept-based Models are a class of inherently explainable networks that
improve upon standard Deep Neural Networks by providing a rationale behind
their predictions using human-understandable `concepts'. With these models
being highly successful in critical applications like medical diagnosis and
financial risk prediction, there is a natural push toward their wider adoption
in sensitive domains to instill greater trust among diverse stakeholders.
However, recent research has uncovered significant limitations in the structure
of such networks, their training procedure, underlying assumptions, and their
susceptibility to adversarial vulnerabilities. In particular, issues such as
concept leakage, entangled representations, and limited robustness to
perturbations pose challenges to their reliability and generalization.
Additionally, the effectiveness of human interventions in these models remains
an open question, raising concerns about their real-world applicability. In
this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on the risks and limitations
associated with Concept-based Models. In particular, we focus on aggregating
commonly encountered challenges and the architecture choices mitigating these
challenges for Supervised and Unsupervised paradigms. We also examine recent
advances in improving their reliability and discuss open problems and promising
avenues of future research in this domain.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的三重注意力Transformer架构，用于预测时间依赖性混凝土徐变，解决了现有方法仅将时间作为输入参数而未建模变形发展序列性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在预测混凝土徐变时未充分建模时间序列性，导致预测精度不足。本文旨在通过Transformer的自注意力机制捕捉徐变历史中的长程依赖关系。

Method: 将混凝土徐变预测转化为自回归序列建模任务，采用三重注意力框架（时间注意力、特征注意力和批次注意力）以捕捉不同维度的依赖关系。

Result: 在标准化实验数据集上，模型表现优异，平均绝对百分比误差为1.63%，R2值为0.999，显著优于传统方法和现有机器学习模型。

Conclusion: 该工作验证了Transformer在材料科学问题中的可行性，展示了数据驱动方法在结构行为预测和工程设计中的潜力。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel Triple Attention Transformer Architecture for
predicting time-dependent concrete creep, addressing fundamental limitations in
current approaches that treat time as merely an input parameter rather than
modeling the sequential nature of deformation development. By transforming
concrete creep prediction into an autoregressive sequence modeling task similar
to language processing, our architecture leverages the transformer's
self-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies in historical
creep patterns. The model implements a triple-stream attention framework
incorporating temporal attention for sequential progression, feature attention
for material property interactions, and batch attention for inter-sample
relationships. Evaluated on experimental datasets with standardized daily
measurements spanning 160 days, the architecture achieves exceptional
performance with mean absolute percentage error of 1.63% and R2 values of 0.999
across all datasets, substantially outperforming traditional empirical models
and existing machine learning approaches. Ablation studies confirm the critical
role of attention mechanisms, with attention pooling contributing most
significantly to model performance. SHAP analysis reveals Young's modulus as
the primary predictive feature, followed by density and compressive strength,
providing interpretability essential for engineering applications. A deployed
web-based interface facilitates practical implementation, enabling real-time
predictions using standard laboratory parameters. This work establishes the
viability of applying transformer architectures to materials science problems,
demonstrating the potential for data-driven approaches to revolutionize
structural behavior prediction and engineering design practices.

Abstract: Forest fire prediction involves estimating the likelihood of fire ignition or
related risk levels in a specific area over a defined time period. With climate
change intensifying fire behavior and frequency, accurate prediction has become
one of the most pressing challenges in Artificial Intelligence (AI).
Traditionally, fire ignition is approached as a binary classification task in
the literature. However, this formulation oversimplifies the problem,
especially from the perspective of end-users such as firefighters. In general,
as is the case in France, firefighting units are organized by department, each
with its terrain, climate conditions, and historical experience with fire
events. Consequently, fire risk should be modeled in a way that is sensitive to
local conditions and does not assume uniform risk across all regions. This
paper proposes a new approach that tailors fire risk assessment to departmental
contexts, offering more actionable and region-specific predictions for
operational use. With this, we present the first national-scale AI benchmark
for metropolitan France using state-of-the-art AI models on a relatively
unexplored dataset. Finally, we offer a summary of important future works that
should be taken into account. Supplementary materials are available on GitHub.

TL;DR: MUC-G4是一种用于深度神经网络压缩增量验证的新框架，通过SMT公式编码和最小不可满足核心（MUC）指导，显著提升了验证效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在边缘设备上部署时面临高内存和运行时复杂性问题，现有增量验证方法仅关注量化且难以处理结构变化。

Method: 将原始和压缩网络编码为SMT公式，分类变化，并利用原始网络的MUC指导压缩网络的验证。

Result: 实验证明MUC-G4能高效处理量化和剪枝，验证时间显著缩短且证明重用率高。

Conclusion: MUC-G4为压缩神经网络的安全性和可靠性提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid development of deep learning has led to challenges in deploying
neural networks on edge devices, mainly due to their high memory and runtime
complexity. Network compression techniques, such as quantization and pruning,
aim to reduce this complexity while maintaining accuracy. However, existing
incremental verification methods often focus only on quantization and struggle
with structural changes. This paper presents MUC-G4 (Minimal Unsat Core-Guided
Incremental Verification), a novel framework for incremental verification of
compressed deep neural networks. It encodes both the original and compressed
networks into SMT formulas, classifies changes, and use \emph{Minimal Unsat
Cores (MUCs)} from the original network to guide efficient verification for the
compressed network. Experimental results show its effectiveness in handling
quantization and pruning, with high proof reuse rates and significant speedup
in verification time compared to traditional methods. MUC-G4 hence offers a
promising solution for ensuring the safety and reliability of compressed neural
networks in practical applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AutoCT结合大型语言模型和经典机器学习，提出了一种可解释且高效的临床试验预测框架，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床试验成本高且耗时，准确预测其结果可降低成本并加速药物研发。现有深度学习模型缺乏可解释性且易受标签泄漏影响。

Method: AutoCT框架结合大型语言模型的推理能力和经典机器学习的可解释性，通过蒙特卡洛树搜索自主生成、评估和优化特征。

Result: 实验表明，AutoCT在有限的自优化迭代中性能达到或超过现有最优方法。

Conclusion: AutoCT为临床试验预测提供了一种可扩展、可解释且成本高效的新范式。

Abstract: Clinical trials are critical for advancing medical treatments but remain
prohibitively expensive and time-consuming. Accurate prediction of clinical
trial outcomes can significantly reduce research and development costs and
accelerate drug discovery. While recent deep learning models have shown promise
by leveraging unstructured data, their black-box nature, lack of
interpretability, and vulnerability to label leakage limit their practical use
in high-stakes biomedical contexts. In this work, we propose AutoCT, a novel
framework that combines the reasoning capabilities of large language models
with the explainability of classical machine learning. AutoCT autonomously
generates, evaluates, and refines tabular features based on public information
without human input. Our method uses Monte Carlo Tree Search to iteratively
optimize predictive performance. Experimental results show that AutoCT performs
on par with or better than SOTA methods on clinical trial prediction tasks
within only a limited number of self-refinement iterations, establishing a new
paradigm for scalable, interpretable, and cost-efficient clinical trial
prediction.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为iS-QL的新方法，通过共享部分网络参数并复制最后一层线性层作为目标网络，解决了目标网络移除后的性能下降问题，同时提高了样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在基于价值的强化学习中，移除目标网络虽然可以释放内存并利用最新估计，但会导致性能下降。本文旨在找到一种折中方案，既能减少内存占用，又能保持性能。

Method: 使用在线网络的最后一层线性层副本作为目标网络，其余参数共享，结合并行学习贝尔曼迭代的迭代Q学习方法。

Result: iS-QL方法在多种设置下提高了目标无关方法的样本效率，且内存占用更小，训练时间与传统目标网络方法相当。

Conclusion: iS-QL方法为强化学习研究提供了一种可扩展的解决方案，平衡了性能和资源消耗。

Abstract: In value-based reinforcement learning, removing the target network is
tempting as the boostrapped target would be built from up-to-date estimates,
and the spared memory occupied by the target network could be reallocated to
expand the capacity of the online network. However, eliminating the target
network introduces instability, leading to a decline in performance. Removing
the target network also means we cannot leverage the literature developed
around target networks. In this work, we propose to use a copy of the last
linear layer of the online network as a target network, while sharing the
remaining parameters with the up-to-date online network, hence stepping out of
the binary choice between target-based and target-free methods. It enables us
to leverage the concept of iterated Q-learning, which consists of learning
consecutive Bellman iterations in parallel, to reduce the performance gap
between target-free and target-based approaches. Our findings demonstrate that
this novel method, termed iterated Shared Q-Learning (iS-QL), improves the
sample efficiency of target-free approaches across various settings.
Importantly, iS-QL requires a smaller memory footprint and comparable training
time to classical target-based algorithms, highlighting its potential to scale
reinforcement learning research.

Motivation: 解决元测试中奖励信号缺失的问题，同时减少元测试所需的在线交互次数。

Method: 利用条件神经过程（CNPs）高效推断任务动态模型，通过单次测试任务滚动生成自适应滚动。

Result: 在2D-Point Agent和连续控制基准测试中，UMCNP比基线方法显著减少了元测试所需的样本量。

Conclusion: UMCNP在元测试中表现出更高的样本效率和适应性，适用于动态参数未知的任务。

Abstract: We introduce Unsupervised Meta-Testing with Conditional Neural Processes
(UMCNP), a novel hybrid few-shot meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) method
that uniquely combines, yet distinctly separates, parameterized policy
gradient-based (PPG) and task inference-based few-shot meta-RL. Tailored for
settings where the reward signal is missing during meta-testing, our method
increases sample efficiency without requiring additional samples in
meta-training. UMCNP leverages the efficiency and scalability of Conditional
Neural Processes (CNPs) to reduce the number of online interactions required in
meta-testing. During meta-training, samples previously collected through PPG
meta-RL are efficiently reused for learning task inference in an offline
manner. UMCNP infers the latent representation of the transition dynamics model
from a single test task rollout with unknown parameters. This approach allows
us to generate rollouts for self-adaptation by interacting with the learned
dynamics model. We demonstrate our method can adapt to an unseen test task
using significantly fewer samples during meta-testing than the baselines in
2D-Point Agent and continuous control meta-RL benchmarks, namely, cartpole with
unknown angle sensor bias, walker agent with randomized dynamics parameters.

TL;DR: 论文研究了神经网络中的grokking现象，发现了一个新的第三阶段——anti-grokking，并利用HTSR指标α区分了所有三个阶段。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索神经网络训练中的grokking现象，尤其是发现新的训练阶段anti-grokking，以更全面地理解模型的泛化行为。

Method: 使用3层MLP在MNIST的1k样本子集上训练，结合WeightWatcher工具的HTSR指标α分析训练阶段。

Result: 发现anti-grokking阶段，HTSR指标α能区分所有三个阶段，而其他指标仅能检测前两个阶段。

Conclusion: HTSR指标α是衡量泛化和过拟合的有效工具，α≈2可作为层收敛的通用目标。

Abstract: We study the well-known grokking phenomena in neural networks (NNs) using a
3-layer MLP trained on 1 k-sample subset of MNIST, with and without weight
decay, and discover a novel third phase -- \emph{anti-grokking} -- that occurs
very late in training and resembles but is distinct from the familiar
\emph{pre-grokking} phases: test accuracy collapses while training accuracy
stays perfect. This late-stage collapse is distinct, from the known
pre-grokking and grokking phases, and is not detected by other proposed
grokking progress measures. Leveraging Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization HTSR
through the open-source WeightWatcher tool, we show that the HTSR layer quality
metric $\alpha$ alone delineates all three phases, whereas the best competing
metrics detect only the first two. The \emph{anti-grokking} is revealed by
training for $10^7$ and is invariably heralded by $\alpha < 2$ and the
appearance of \emph{Correlation Traps} -- outlier singular values in the
randomized layer weight matrices that make the layer weight matrix atypical and
signal overfitting of the training set. Such traps are verified by visual
inspection of the layer-wise empirical spectral densities, and by using
Kolmogorov--Smirnov tests on randomized spectra. Comparative metrics, including
activation sparsity, absolute weight entropy, circuit complexity, and $l^2$
weight norms track pre-grokking and grokking but fail to distinguish grokking
from anti-grokking. This discovery provides a way to measure overfitting and
generalization collapse without direct access to the test data. These results
strengthen the claim that the \emph{HTSR} $\alpha$ provides universal
layer-convergence target at $\alpha \approx 2$ and underscore the value of
using the HTSR alpha $(\alpha)$ metric as a measure of generalization.

Motivation: 研究动机在于澄清系统性在ML模型中的核心作用，并指出现有研究主要关注行为系统性而忽略了表征系统性。

Method: 通过分析Hadley（1994）的分类法，评估了语言和视觉领域关键基准测试对行为系统性的覆盖程度。

Result: 研究发现现有基准测试主要测试行为系统性，并提出了在机制可解释性领域中评估表征系统性的方法。

Conclusion: 结论强调需要更全面地评估系统性，尤其是表征系统性，以推动ML模型的系统性泛化能力。

Abstract: A core aspect of compositionality, systematicity is a desirable property in
ML models as it enables strong generalization to novel contexts. This has led
to numerous studies proposing benchmarks to assess systematic generalization,
as well as models and training regimes designed to enhance it. Many of these
efforts are framed as addressing the challenge posed by Fodor and Pylyshyn.
However, while they argue for systematicity of representations, existing
benchmarks and models primarily focus on the systematicity of behaviour. We
emphasize the crucial nature of this distinction. Furthermore, building on
Hadley's (1994) taxonomy of systematic generalization, we analyze the extent to
which behavioural systematicity is tested by key benchmarks in the literature
across language and vision. Finally, we highlight ways of assessing
systematicity of representations in ML models as practiced in the field of
mechanistic interpretability.

Abstract: This study investigates the application of machine learning (ML) models for
classifying dental providers into two categories - standard rendering providers
and safety net clinic (SNC) providers - using a 2018 dataset of 24,300
instances with 20 features. The dataset, characterized by high missing values
(38.1%), includes service counts (preventive, treatment, exams), delivery
systems (FFS, managed care), and beneficiary demographics. Feature ranking
methods such as information gain, Gini index, and ANOVA were employed to
identify critical predictors, revealing treatment-related metrics
(TXMT_USER_CNT, TXMT_SVC_CNT) as top-ranked features. Twelve ML models,
including k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines
(SVM), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Random Forest, Neural Networks, and
Gradient Boosting, were evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation.
Classification accuracy was tested across incremental feature subsets derived
from rankings. The Neural Network achieved the highest accuracy (94.1%) using
all 20 features, followed by Gradient Boosting (93.2%) and Random Forest
(93.0%). Models showed improved performance as more features were incorporated,
with SGD and ensemble methods demonstrating robustness to missing data. Feature
ranking highlighted the dominance of treatment service counts and annotation
codes in distinguishing provider types, while demographic variables (AGE_GROUP,
CALENDAR_YEAR) had minimal impact. The study underscores the importance of
feature selection in enhancing model efficiency and accuracy, particularly in
imbalanced healthcare datasets. These findings advocate for integrating
feature-ranking techniques with advanced ML algorithms to optimize dental
provider classification, enabling targeted resource allocation for underserved
populations.

Abstract: Dental provider classification plays a crucial role in optimizing healthcare
resource allocation and policy planning. Effective categorization of providers,
such as standard rendering providers and safety net clinic (SNC) providers,
enhances service delivery to underserved populations. This study aimed to
evaluate the performance of machine learning models in classifying dental

categorized by delivery system and patient age groups (0-20 and 21+). Despite
38.1% missing data, multiple machine learning algorithms were tested, including
k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM),
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Random Forest, Neural Networks, and Gradient
Boosting. A 10-fold cross-validation approach was applied, and models were
evaluated using AUC, classification accuracy (CA), F1-score, precision, and
recall. Neural Networks achieved the highest AUC (0.975) and CA (94.1%),
followed by Random Forest (AUC: 0.948, CA: 93.0%). These models effectively
handled imbalanced data and complex feature interactions, outperforming
traditional classifiers like Logistic Regression and SVM. Advanced machine

significantly enhance dental workforce classification. Their integration into
healthcare analytics can improve provider identification and resource

Conclusion: NOBLE为理解神经元组成、计算及神经AI应用提供了新工具。

Abstract: Characterizing the diverse computational properties of human neurons via
multimodal electrophysiological, transcriptomic, and morphological data
provides the foundation for constructing and validating bio-realistic neuron
models that can advance our understanding of fundamental mechanisms underlying
brain function. However, current modeling approaches remain constrained by the
limited availability and intrinsic variability of experimental neuronal data.
To capture variability, ensembles of deterministic models are often used, but
are difficult to scale as model generation requires repeating computationally
expensive optimization for each neuron. While deep learning is becoming
increasingly relevant in this space, it fails to capture the full biophysical
complexity of neurons, their nonlinear voltage dynamics, and variability. To
address these shortcomings, we introduce NOBLE, a neural operator framework
that learns a mapping from a continuous frequency-modulated embedding of
interpretable neuron features to the somatic voltage response induced by
current injection. Trained on data generated from biophysically realistic
neuron models, NOBLE predicts distributions of neural dynamics accounting for
the intrinsic experimental variability. Unlike conventional bio-realistic
neuron models, interpolating within the embedding space offers models whose
dynamics are consistent with experimentally observed responses. NOBLE is the
first scaled-up deep learning framework validated on real experimental data,
enabling efficient generation of synthetic neurons that exhibit trial-to-trial
variability and achieve a $4200\times$ speedup over numerical solvers. To this
end, NOBLE captures fundamental neural properties, opening the door to a better
understanding of cellular composition and computations, neuromorphic

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的差分隐私语言模型推理方法，通过聚类输入数据并利用中位数聚合令牌预测，提高了生成文本的质量和隐私保护效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的差分隐私语言模型推理方法通过均匀采样敏感输入生成合成文本，但在处理异构主题时效果不佳。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过聚类输入数据选择推理批次，并利用中位数（而非平均值）聚合令牌预测，以降低局部敏感性并提升隐私保护效果。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在代表性指标（如MAUVE）和下游任务性能上均有提升，且在更低隐私成本下生成高质量合成数据。

Conclusion: 聚类输入数据和中位数聚合策略显著提升了差分隐私语言模型推理的效果，为生成高质量隐私保护文本提供了新思路。

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) language model inference is an approach for
generating private synthetic text. A sensitive input example is used to prompt
an off-the-shelf large language model (LLM) to produce a similar example.
Multiple examples can be aggregated together to formally satisfy the DP
guarantee.
  Prior work creates inference batches by sampling sensitive inputs uniformly
at random. We show that uniform sampling degrades the quality of privately
generated text, especially when the sensitive examples concern heterogeneous
topics.
  We remedy this problem by clustering the input data before selecting
inference batches. Next, we observe that clustering also leads to more similar
next-token predictions across inferences. We use this insight to introduce a
new algorithm that aggregates next token statistics by privately computing
medians instead of averages. This approach leverages the fact that the median
has decreased local sensitivity when next token predictions are similar,
allowing us to state a data-dependent and ex-post DP guarantee about the
privacy properties of this algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate improvements in
terms of representativeness metrics (e.g., MAUVE) as well as downstream task
performance. We show that our method produces high-quality synthetic data at
significantly lower privacy cost than a previous state-of-the-art method.

Abstract: In studies of transferable learning, scaling laws are obtained for various
important foundation models to predict their properties and performance at
larger scales. We show here how scaling law derivation can also be used for
model and dataset comparison, allowing to decide which procedure is to be
preferred for pre-training. For the first time, full scaling laws based on
dense measurements across a wide span of model and samples seen scales are
derived for two important language-vision learning procedures, CLIP and MaMMUT,
that use either contrastive only or contrastive and captioning text generative
loss. Ensuring sufficient prediction accuracy for held out points, we use
derived scaling laws to compare both models, obtaining evidence for MaMMUT's
stronger improvement with scale and better sample efficiency than standard
CLIP. To strengthen validity of the comparison, we show scaling laws for
various downstream tasks, classification, retrieval, and segmentation, and for
different open datasets, DataComp, DFN and Re-LAION, observing consistently the
same trends. We show that comparison can also be performed when deriving
scaling laws with a constant learning rate schedule, reducing compute cost.
Accurate derivation of scaling laws provides thus means to perform model and
dataset comparison across scale spans, avoiding misleading conclusions based on
measurements from single reference scales only, paving the road for systematic
comparison and improvement of open foundation models and datasets for their
creation. We release all the pre-trained models with their intermediate
checkpoints, including openMaMMUT-L/14, which achieves $80.3\%$ zero-shot
ImageNet-1k accuracy, trained on 12.8B samples from DataComp-1.4B. Code for
reproducing experiments in the paper and raw experiments data can be found at

Abstract: We introduce $Urania$, a novel framework for generating insights about LLM
chatbot interactions with rigorous differential privacy (DP) guarantees. The
framework employs a private clustering mechanism and innovative keyword
extraction methods, including frequency-based, TF-IDF-based, and LLM-guided

Our evaluation assesses lexical and semantic content preservation, pair
similarity, and LLM-based metrics, benchmarking against a non-private
Clio-inspired pipeline (Tamkin et al., 2024). Moreover, we develop a simple
empirical privacy evaluation that demonstrates the enhanced robustness of our

conversational insights while maintaining stringent user privacy, effectively
balancing data utility with privacy preservation.

TL;DR: DIPNet通过将输入投影到可学习的分布中，平滑损失景观，从而提升泛化性能，并在多种架构和任务中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 过参数化模型的训练损失难以反映泛化性能，而平滑性虽与泛化相关，但在神经网络中直接实现平滑性仍具挑战性。

Method: 提出DIPNet框架，将输入逐层投影到可学习的分布中，通过分布表示平滑损失景观。

Result: 理论分析显示DIPNet降低了局部平滑性度量和网络的Lipschitz常数，实验验证其在多种架构和任务中提升测试性能。

Conclusion: DIPNet是一种通用且有效的方法，可无缝集成到现有模型中，提升现代深度学习的泛化性能。

Abstract: As overparameterized models become increasingly prevalent, training loss
alone offers limited insight into generalization performance. While smoothness
has been linked to improved generalization across various settings, directly
enforcing smoothness in neural networks remains challenging. To address this,
we introduce Distributional Input Projection Networks (DIPNet), a novel
framework that projects inputs into learnable distributions at each layer. This
distributional representation induces a smoother loss landscape with respect to
the input, promoting better generalization. We provide theoretical analysis
showing that DIPNet reduces both local smoothness measures and the Lipschitz
constant of the network, contributing to improved generalization performance.
Empirically, we validate DIPNet across a wide range of architectures and tasks,
including Vision Transformers (ViTs), Large Language Models (LLMs), ResNet and
MLPs. Our method consistently enhances test performance under standard
settings, adversarial attacks, out-of-distribution inputs, and reasoning
benchmarks. We demonstrate that the proposed input projection strategy can be
seamlessly integrated into existing models, providing a general and effective
approach for boosting generalization performance in modern deep learning.

Motivation: 理解边对GNN行为的影响对提高其可解释性和鲁棒性至关重要，但现有方法依赖严格凸性假设且仅考虑边删除。

Result: 实验证明该方法能准确预测GNN中边修改的影响，并在图重连和对抗攻击等应用中表现出多功能性。

Conclusion: 该方法为GNN的影响预测提供了更灵活和准确的工具，适用于多种实际应用。

Abstract: Understanding how individual edges influence the behavior of graph neural
networks (GNNs) is essential for improving their interpretability and
robustness. Graph influence functions have emerged as promising tools to
efficiently estimate the effects of edge deletions without retraining. However,
existing influence prediction methods rely on strict convexity assumptions,
exclusively consider the influence of edge deletions while disregarding edge
insertions, and fail to capture changes in message propagation caused by these
modifications. In this work, we propose a proximal Bregman response function
specifically tailored for GNNs, relaxing the convexity requirement and enabling
accurate influence prediction for standard neural network architectures.
Furthermore, our method explicitly accounts for message propagation effects and
extends influence prediction to both edge deletions and insertions in a
principled way. Experiments with real-world datasets demonstrate accurate
influence predictions for different characteristics of GNNs. We further
demonstrate that the influence function is versatile in applications such as
graph rewiring and adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: RLVR的理论研究深化了对强化学习在LLM微调中作用的理解，并为增强推理能力提供了新思路。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated remarkable success in enhancing
model capabilities, including instruction-following, preference learning, and
reasoning. Yet despite its empirical successes, the mechanisms by which RL
improves reasoning abilities remain poorly understood. We present a systematic
study of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), showing that
its primary benefit comes from optimizing the selection of existing reasoning
patterns. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that RLVR-trained
models preferentially adopt high-success-rate reasoning patterns while mostly
maintaining stable performance on individual patterns. We further develop
theoretical analyses on the convergence and training dynamics of RLVR based on
a simplified question-reason-answer model. We study the gradient flow and show
that RLVR can indeed find the solution that selects the reason pattern with the
highest success rate. Besides, our theoretical results
  reveal two distinct regimes regarding the convergence of RLVR training: (1)
rapid convergence for models with relatively strong initial reasoning
capabilities versus (2) slower optimization dynamics for weaker models.
Furthermore, we show that the slower optimization for weaker models can be
mitigated by applying the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) before RLVR, when using
a feasibly high-quality SFT dataset. We validate the theoretical findings
through extensive experiments. This work advances our theoretical understanding
of RL's role in LLM fine-tuning and offers insights for further enhancing
reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: 双ISL在理论和实践中均表现出优越性，为隐式生成模型提供了一种高效且稳定的训练方法。

Abstract: Rank-based statistical metrics, such as the invariant statistical loss (ISL),
have recently emerged as robust and practically effective tools for training
implicit generative models. In this work, we introduce dual-ISL, a novel
likelihood-free objective for training implicit generative models that
interchanges the roles of the target and model distributions in the ISL
framework, yielding a convex optimization problem in the space of model
densities. We prove that the resulting rank-based discrepancy $d_K$ is i)
continuous under weak convergence and with respect to the $L^1$ norm, and ii)
convex in its first argument-properties not shared by classical divergences
such as KL or Wasserstein distances. Building on this, we develop a theoretical
framework that interprets $d_K$ as an $L^2$-projection of the density ratio $q
= p/\tilde p$ onto a Bernstein polynomial basis, from which we derive exact
bounds on the truncation error, precise convergence rates, and a closed-form
expression for the truncated density approximation. We further extend our
analysis to the multivariate setting via random one-dimensional projections,
defining a sliced dual-ISL divergence that retains both convexity and
continuity. We empirically show that these theoretical advantages translate
into practical ones. Specifically, across several benchmarks dual-ISL converges
more rapidly, delivers markedly smoother and more stable training, and more
effectively prevents mode collapse than classical ISL and other leading
implicit generative methods-while also providing an explicit density
approximation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成模型的普及，如何在不完全重新训练的情况下选择性移除特定数据的影响（如隐私、法律或有害内容）变得至关重要。

Method: 采用基于损失梯度正交化的算法，确保在移除不需要的数据时，不影响模型的其他性能。

Result: 在MNIST和CelebA数据集上，该算法比传统方法（如梯度手术）快几个数量级，且能有效遗忘数据并保持模型保真度。

Conclusion: 该算法为生成模型的数据遗忘提供了一种高效且可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: As generative models become increasingly powerful and pervasive, the ability
to unlearn specific data, whether due to privacy concerns, legal requirements,
or the correction of harmful content, has become increasingly important. Unlike
in conventional training, where data are accumulated and knowledge is
reinforced, unlearning aims to selectively remove the influence of particular
data points without costly retraining from scratch. To be effective and
reliable, such algorithms need to achieve (i) forgetting of the undesired data,
(ii) preservation of the quality of the generation, (iii) preservation of the
influence of the desired training data on the model parameters, and (iv) small
number of training steps. We propose fast unlearning algorithms based on loss
gradient orthogonalization. We show that our algorithms are able to forget data
while maintaining the fidelity of the original model. Using MNIST and CelebA
data, we demonstrate that our algorithms achieve orders of magnitude faster
unlearning times than their predecessors, such as gradient surgery.

Abstract: Healthcare systems face significant challenges in managing and interpreting
vast, heterogeneous patient data for personalized care. Existing approaches
often focus on narrow use cases with a limited feature space, overlooking the
complex, longitudinal interactions needed for a holistic understanding of
patient health. In this work, we propose a novel approach to patient pathway
modeling by transforming diverse electronic health record (EHR) data into a
structured representation and designing a holistic pathway prediction model,
EHR2Path, optimized to predict future health trajectories. Further, we
introduce a novel summary mechanism that embeds long-term temporal context into
topic-specific summary tokens, improving performance over text-only models,
while being much more token-efficient. EHR2Path demonstrates strong performance
in both next time-step prediction and longitudinal simulation, outperforming
competitive baselines. It enables detailed simulations of patient trajectories,
inherently targeting diverse evaluation tasks, such as forecasting vital signs,
lab test results, or length-of-stay, opening a path towards predictive and
personalized healthcare.

Motivation: 尽管稀疏自编码器（SAEs）和变分自编码器（VAEs）在建模低维潜在结构方面具有广泛适用性，但它们存在未被充分认识的弱点。本文旨在解决这些局限性。

Conclusion: 该混合模型在图像和语言模型激活模式等领域超越了传统SAEs、VAEs以及部分扩散模型的性能。

Abstract: Is there really much more to say about sparse autoencoders (SAEs)?
Autoencoders in general, and SAEs in particular, represent deep architectures
that are capable of modeling low-dimensional latent structure in data. Such
structure could reflect, among other things, correlation patterns in large
language model activations, or complex natural image manifolds. And yet despite
the wide-ranging applicability, there have been relatively few changes to SAEs
beyond the original recipe from decades ago, namely, standard deep
encoder/decoder layers trained with a classical/deterministic sparse
regularizer applied within the latent space. One possible exception is the
variational autoencoder (VAE), which adopts a stochastic encoder module capable
of producing sparse representations when applied to manifold data. In this work
we formalize underappreciated weaknesses with both canonical SAEs, as well as
analogous VAEs applied to similar tasks, and propose a hybrid alternative model
that circumvents these prior limitations. In terms of theoretical support, we
prove that global minima of our proposed model recover certain forms of
structured data spread across a union of manifolds. Meanwhile, empirical
evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets substantiate the efficacy of
our approach in accurately estimating underlying manifold dimensions and
producing sparser latent representations without compromising reconstruction
error. In general, we are able to exceed the performance of equivalent-capacity
SAEs and VAEs, as well as recent diffusion models where applicable, within
domains such as images and language model activation patterns.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in training long-context reasoning models via
reinforcement learning (RL), several open questions and counterintuitive
behaviors remain. This work focuses on three key aspects: (1) We systematically
analyze the roles of positive and negative samples in RL, revealing that
positive samples mainly facilitate data fitting, whereas negative samples
significantly enhance generalization and robustness. Interestingly, training
solely on negative samples can rival standard RL training performance. (2) We
identify substantial data inefficiency in group relative policy optimization,
where over half of the samples yield zero advantage. To address this, we
explore two straightforward strategies, including relative length rewards and
offline sample injection, to better leverage these data and enhance reasoning
efficiency and capability. (3) We investigate unstable performance across
various reasoning models and benchmarks, attributing instability to uncertain
problems with ambiguous outcomes, and demonstrate that multiple evaluation runs
mitigate this issue.

Result: 在四个数据集上的实验表明，SHARP在全局和度级别上均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: HAR和SHARP能有效缓解GNN的度偏差问题，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often suffer from degree bias in node
classification tasks, where prediction performance varies across nodes with
different degrees. Several approaches, which adopt Graph Contrastive Learning
(GCL), have been proposed to mitigate this bias. However, the limited number of
positive pairs and the equal weighting of all positives and negatives in GCL
still lead to low-degree nodes acquiring insufficient and noisy information.
This paper proposes the Hardness Adaptive Reweighted (HAR) contrastive loss to
mitigate degree bias. It adds more positive pairs by leveraging node labels and
adaptively weights positive and negative pairs based on their learning
hardness. In addition, we develop an experimental framework named SHARP to
extend HAR to a broader range of scenarios. Both our theoretical analysis and
experiments validate the effectiveness of SHARP. The experimental results
across four datasets show that SHARP achieves better performance against
baselines at both global and degree levels.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer 模型在处理长上下文时存在时间和内存复杂度高的问题，RMTs 虽降低了复杂度，但顺序执行机制导致性能瓶颈。

Method: 提出了 Diagonal Batching 调度方案，通过重新排序计算实现并行化，无需重新训练现有 RMT 模型。

Result: 在 LLaMA-1B ARMT 模型上，Diagonal Batching 实现了 3.3 倍于标准全注意力 LLaMA-1B 和 1.8 倍于顺序 RMT 的速度提升。

Conclusion: Diagonal Batching 消除了顺序瓶颈，降低了推理成本和延迟，使 RMTs 成为实际长上下文应用的可行解决方案。

Abstract: Transformer models struggle with long-context inference due to their
quadratic time and linear memory complexity. Recurrent Memory Transformers
(RMTs) offer a solution by reducing the asymptotic cost to linear time and
constant memory usage. However, their memory update mechanism leads to
sequential execution, causing a performance bottleneck.
  We introduce Diagonal Batching, a scheduling scheme that unlocks parallelism
across segments in RMTs while preserving exact recurrence. This approach
eliminates the sequential constraint, enabling efficient GPU inference even for
single long-context inputs without complex batching and pipelining techniques.
Because the technique is purely a run-time computation reordering, existing RMT
models adopt it with no retraining.
  Applied to a LLaMA-1B ARMT model, Diagonal Batching yields a 3.3x speedup
over standard full-attention LLaMA-1B and a 1.8x speedup over the sequential
RMT implementation on 131,072-token sequences. By removing sequential
bottleneck, Diagonal Batching reduces inference cost and latency, thereby
strengthening RMTs as a practical solution for real-world, long-context
applications.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose $\textbf{C}$oncept $\textbf{REA}$soning
$\textbf{M}$odels (CREAM), a novel family of Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs)
that: (i) explicitly encodes concept-concept (${\texttt{C-C}}$) and
concept-task (${\texttt{C$\rightarrow$Y}}$) relationships to enforce a desired
model reasoning; and (ii) use a regularized side-channel to achieve competitive
task performance, while keeping high concept importance. Specifically, CREAM
architecturally embeds (bi)directed concept-concept, and concept to task
relationships specified by a human expert, while severing undesired information
flows (e.g., to handle mutually exclusive concepts). Moreover, CREAM integrates
a black-box side-channel that is regularized to encourage task predictions to
be grounded in the relevant concepts, thereby utilizing the side-channel only
when necessary to enhance performance. Our experiments show that: (i) CREAM
mainly relies on concepts while achieving task performance on par with
black-box models; and (ii) the embedded ${\texttt{C-C}}$ and
${\texttt{C$\rightarrow$Y}}$ relationships ease model interventions and
mitigate concept leakage.

Abstract: Sequence modeling is currently dominated by causal transformer architectures

scaling memory and compute linearly during inference. A recent stream of work
linearized the softmax operation, resulting in powerful recurrent neural
network (RNN) models with constant memory and compute costs such as DeltaNet,
Mamba or xLSTM. These models can be unified by noting that their recurrent
layer dynamics can all be derived from an in-context regression objective,
approximately optimized through an online learning rule. Here, we join this
line of work and introduce a numerically stable, chunkwise parallelizable
version of the recently proposed Mesa layer (von Oswald et al., 2024), and
study it in language modeling at the billion-parameter scale. This layer again
stems from an in-context loss, but which is now minimized to optimality at
every time point using a fast conjugate gradient solver. Through an extensive
suite of experiments, we show that optimal test-time training enables reaching
lower language modeling perplexity and higher downstream benchmark performance
than previous RNNs, especially on tasks requiring long context understanding.
This performance gain comes at the cost of additional flops spent during
inference time. Our results are therefore intriguingly related to recent trends
of increasing test-time compute to improve performance -- here by spending
compute to solve sequential optimization problems within the neural network
itself.

TL;DR: 本文提出两种技术（难度目标在线数据选择和回放重播）以提高LLM强化学习微调中的数据效率，显著减少训练时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习微调大型语言模型资源消耗高，现有研究忽视数据效率问题。

Method: 提出自适应难度概念指导在线数据选择，开发基于注意力的框架估计难度，并引入回放机制减少计算成本。

Result: 实验表明，方法在6种LLM-数据集组合中减少25%至65%的训练时间，达到与GRPO算法相同的性能。

Conclusion: 所提方法显著提升数据效率，降低强化学习微调的资源需求。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become an effective approach for fine-tuning
large language models (LLMs), particularly to enhance their reasoning
capabilities. However, RL fine-tuning remains highly resource-intensive, and
existing work has largely overlooked the problem of data efficiency. In this
paper, we propose two techniques to improve data efficiency in LLM RL
fine-tuning: difficulty-targeted online data selection and rollout replay. We
introduce the notion of adaptive difficulty to guide online data selection,
prioritizing questions of moderate difficulty that are more likely to yield
informative learning signals. To estimate adaptive difficulty efficiently, we
develop an attention-based framework that requires rollouts for only a small
reference set of questions. The adaptive difficulty of the remaining questions
is then estimated based on their similarity to this set. To further reduce
rollout cost, we introduce a rollout replay mechanism that reuses recent
rollouts, lowering per-step computation while maintaining stable updates.
Extensive experiments across 6 LLM-dataset combinations show that our method
reduces RL fine-tuning time by 25% to 65% to reach the same level of
performance as the original GRPO algorithm.

TL;DR: 论文通过类间特征归因视角研究对抗训练（AT），发现跨类特征对AT的关键影响，并揭示AT过程中模型从学习跨类特征到依赖类特定特征的动态变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗训练（AT）的机制和动态仍是不明确的研究问题，本文旨在通过类间特征归因视角深入理解AT。

Method: 通过类间特征归因分析AT，提出跨类特征的概念，并通过理论模型和系统实验验证其作用。

Result: 研究发现，AT初期模型倾向于学习跨类特征，而在后期则转向依赖类特定特征，导致鲁棒过拟合。

Conclusion: 研究为AT机制提供了新视角，统一解释了软标签训练的优势和鲁棒过拟合现象。

Abstract: Adversarial training (AT) has been considered one of the most effective
methods for making deep neural networks robust against adversarial attacks,
while the training mechanisms and dynamics of AT remain open research problems.
In this paper, we present a novel perspective on studying AT through the lens
of class-wise feature attribution. Specifically, we identify the impact of a
key family of features on AT that are shared by multiple classes, which we call
cross-class features. These features are typically useful for robust
classification, which we offer theoretical evidence to illustrate through a
synthetic data model. Through systematic studies across multiple model
architectures and settings, we find that during the initial stage of AT, the
model tends to learn more cross-class features until the best robustness
checkpoint. As AT further squeezes the training robust loss and causes robust
overfitting, the model tends to make decisions based on more class-specific
features. Based on these discoveries, we further provide a unified view of two
existing properties of AT, including the advantage of soft-label training and
robust overfitting. Overall, these insights refine the current understanding of
AT mechanisms and provide new perspectives on studying them. Our code is

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的时间序列可解释人工智能（XAI）方法TIMING，通过改进传统集成梯度（IG）方法，引入时间感知能力，并提出了新的评估指标CPD和CPP。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统XAI方法在时间序列中仅关注点级归因幅度，忽略了方向性影响，导致关键点识别不准确。

Method: 提出TIMING方法，增强IG的时间感知能力，避免生成路径时忽略时间关系。

Result: TIMING在合成和真实时间序列基准测试中优于现有XAI基线方法。

Conclusion: TIMING通过改进IG的时间感知能力，显著提升了时间序列XAI的性能。

Abstract: Recent explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods for time series
primarily estimate point-wise attribution magnitudes, while overlooking the
directional impact on predictions, leading to suboptimal identification of
significant points. Our analysis shows that conventional Integrated Gradients
(IG) effectively capture critical points with both positive and negative
impacts on predictions. However, current evaluation metrics fail to assess this
capability, as they inadvertently cancel out opposing feature contributions. To
address this limitation, we propose novel evaluation metrics-Cumulative
Prediction Difference (CPD) and Cumulative Prediction Preservation (CPP)-to
systematically assess whether attribution methods accurately identify
significant positive and negative points in time series XAI. Under these
metrics, conventional IG outperforms recent counterparts. However, directly
applying IG to time series data may lead to suboptimal outcomes, as generated
paths ignore temporal relationships and introduce out-of-distribution samples.
To overcome these challenges, we introduce TIMING, which enhances IG by
incorporating temporal awareness while maintaining its theoretical properties.
Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world time series benchmarks
demonstrate that TIMING outperforms existing time series XAI baselines. Our
code is available at https://github.com/drumpt/TIMING.

TL;DR: 研究发现，小模型在测试时的效率被高估，提出了一种新的Kinetics Scaling Law，强调稀疏注意力的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视测试时的扩展规律，揭示小模型效率被高估的问题，并提出更优的资源分配方法。

Method: 通过分析0.6B到32B参数模型，提出Kinetics Scaling Law，并引入稀疏注意力降低单token成本。

Result: 稀疏注意力模型在低资源和高资源场景下均优于密集模型，AIME问题解决准确率提升显著。

Conclusion: 稀疏注意力是实现测试时扩展潜力的关键，代码已开源。

Abstract: We rethink test-time scaling laws from a practical efficiency perspective,
revealing that the effectiveness of smaller models is significantly
overestimated. Prior work, grounded in compute-optimality, overlooks critical
memory access bottlenecks introduced by inference-time strategies (e.g.,
Best-of-$N$, long CoTs). Our holistic analysis, spanning models from 0.6B to
32B parameters, reveals a new Kinetics Scaling Law that better guides resource
allocation by incorporating both computation and memory access costs. Kinetics
Scaling Law suggests that test-time compute is more effective when used on
models above a threshold than smaller ones. A key reason is that in TTS,
attention, rather than parameter count, emerges as the dominant cost factor.
Motivated by this, we propose a new scaling paradigm centered on sparse
attention, which lowers per-token cost and enables longer generations and more
parallel samples within the same resource budget. Empirically, we show that
sparse attention models consistently outperform dense counterparts, achieving
over 60 points gains in low-cost regimes and over 5 points gains in high-cost
regimes for problem-solving accuracy on AIME, encompassing evaluations on
state-of-the-art MoEs. These results suggest that sparse attention is essential
for realizing the full potential of test-time scaling because, unlike training,
where parameter scaling saturates, test-time accuracy continues to improve
through increased generation. The code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 通过压缩KV缓存实现推理时超扩展，动态内存稀疏化（DMS）方法在保持精度的同时显著提升推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer LLMs的推理成本受限于KV缓存大小，而非生成令牌数量，因此探索通过压缩KV缓存提高推理效率。

Method: 提出动态内存稀疏化（DMS），延迟令牌驱逐并隐式合并表示，仅需1K训练步骤即可实现8倍压缩。

Result: DMS在多个LLM家族中验证有效，提升推理精度且不增加运行时内存负载，例如Qwen-R1 32B在多个基准测试中显著提升。

Conclusion: 推理时超扩展结合DMS是一种实用方法，可在相同计算预算下显著提升模型推理精度。

Abstract: Inference-time scaling trades efficiency for increased reasoning accuracy by
generating longer or more parallel sequences. However, in Transformer LLMs,
generation cost is bottlenecked by the size of the key-value (KV) cache, rather
than the number of generated tokens. Hence, we explore inference-time
hyper-scaling: by compressing the KV cache, we can generate more tokens within
the same compute budget and further improve the accuracy of scaled inference.
The success of this approach, however, hinges on the ability of compression
methods to preserve accuracy even at high compression ratios. To make
hyper-scaling practical, we introduce Dynamic Memory Sparsification (DMS), a
novel method for sparsifying KV caches that only requires 1K training steps to
achieve 8$\times$ compression, while maintaining better accuracy than
training-free sparse attention. Instead of prematurely discarding cached
tokens, DMS delays token eviction, implicitly merging representations and
preserving critical information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
inference-time hyper-scaling with DMS on multiple families of LLMs, showing
that it boosts accuracy for comparable inference runtime and memory load. For
instance, we enhance Qwen-R1 32B by an average of 9.1 points on AIME 24, 7.6 on
GPQA, and 9.6 on LiveCodeBench across compute budgets.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为YOTO的方法，通过单次训练自动优化损失权重超参数，避免了多次训练的需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型训练中，损失权重的选择和调整需要多次训练运行，效率低下。YOTO旨在通过单次训练解决这一问题。

Method: YOTO将损失权重超参数视为网络参数，通过梯度优化自动学习。采用软最大操作和正则化损失确保优化过程的稳定性和有效性。

Result: 在3D估计和语义分割任务中，YOTO优于传统的网格搜索方法，并在未见测试数据上表现更优。

Conclusion: YOTO通过单次训练实现了损失权重的自动优化，显著提高了训练效率，并在多个任务中表现优异。

Abstract: The title of this paper is perhaps an overclaim. Of course, the process of
creating and optimizing a learned model inevitably involves multiple training
runs which potentially feature different architectural designs, input and
output encodings, and losses. However, our method, You Only Train Once (YOTO),
indeed contributes to limiting training to one shot for the latter aspect of
losses selection and weighting. We achieve this by automatically optimizing
loss weight hyperparameters of learned models in one shot via standard
gradient-based optimization, treating these hyperparameters as regular
parameters of the networks and learning them. To this end, we leverage the
differentiability of the composite loss formulation which is widely used for
optimizing multiple empirical losses simultaneously and model it as a novel
layer which is parameterized with a softmax operation that satisfies the
inherent positivity constraints on loss hyperparameters while avoiding
degenerate empirical gradients. We complete our joint end-to-end optimization
scheme by defining a novel regularization loss on the learned hyperparameters,
which models a uniformity prior among the employed losses while ensuring
boundedness of the identified optima. We evidence the efficacy of YOTO in
jointly optimizing loss hyperparameters and regular model parameters in one
shot by comparing it to the commonly used brute-force grid search across
state-of-the-art networks solving two key problems in computer vision, i.e. 3D
estimation and semantic segmentation, and showing that it consistently
outperforms the best grid-search model on unseen test data. Code will be made
publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在全轨迹级别定义的奖励对优化推理中间步骤的指导不足，需要更细粒度的奖励信号。

Method: TreeRPO利用树采样直接估计步骤级奖励，结合GRPO的组相对奖励机制，生成密集的奖励信号。

Result: 实验表明，TreeRPO将Qwen-2.5-Math的Pass@1准确率从19.0%提升至35.5%，并显著优于GRPO。

Conclusion: TreeRPO通过细粒度奖励信号有效提升了LLMs的推理能力和效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities
through Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) methods. However,
a key limitation of existing approaches is that rewards defined at the full
trajectory level provide insufficient guidance for optimizing the intermediate
steps of a reasoning process. To address this, we introduce \textbf{\name}, a
novel method that estimates the mathematical expectations of rewards at various
reasoning steps using tree sampling. Unlike prior methods that rely on a
separate step reward model, \name directly estimates these rewards through this
sampling process. Building on the group-relative reward training mechanism of
GRPO, \name innovatively computes rewards based on step-level groups generated
during tree sampling. This advancement allows \name to produce fine-grained and
dense reward signals, significantly enhancing the learning process and overall
performance of LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that our \name algorithm
substantially improves the average Pass@1 accuracy of Qwen-2.5-Math on test
benchmarks, increasing it from 19.0\% to 35.5\%. Furthermore, \name
significantly outperforms GRPO by 2.9\% in performance while simultaneously
reducing the average response length by 18.1\%, showcasing its effectiveness
and efficiency. Our code will be available at

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a promising solution to accommodate multiple
large models within constrained memory budgets. We present StatsMerging, a
novel lightweight learning-based model merging method guided by weight
distribution statistics without requiring ground truth labels or test samples.
StatsMerging offers three key advantages: (1) It uniquely leverages singular
values from singular value decomposition (SVD) to capture task-specific weight
distributions, serving as a proxy for task importance to guide task coefficient
prediction; (2) It employs a lightweight learner StatsMergeLearner to model the
weight distributions of task-specific pre-trained models, improving
generalization and enhancing adaptation to unseen samples; (3) It introduces
Task-Specific Teacher Distillation for merging vision models with heterogeneous
architectures, a merging learning paradigm that avoids costly ground-truth
labels by task-specific teacher distillation. Notably, we present two types of
knowledge distillation, (a) distilling knowledge from task-specific models to
StatsMergeLearner; and (b) distilling knowledge from models with heterogeneous
architectures prior to merging. Extensive experiments across eight tasks
demonstrate the effectiveness of StatsMerging. Our results show that
StatsMerging outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in terms of overall
accuracy, generalization to unseen tasks, and robustness to image quality
variations.

Motivation: 尽管测试时策略在大型语言模型中取得了成功，但其样本效率的理论理解仍然有限，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过理论分析比较自一致性和最佳-n的样本需求，并研究自校正方法在多任务中的表达能力。

Result: 自一致性需要Θ(1/Δ²)样本，最佳-n仅需Θ(1/Δ)；自校正方法使Transformer能够模拟在线学习，适用于多任务。

Conclusion: 自校正方法在多任务中具有理论支持和实际效果，扩展了Transformer的表征能力。

Abstract: Test-time scaling paradigms have significantly advanced the capabilities of
large language models (LLMs) on complex tasks. Despite their empirical success,
theoretical understanding of the sample efficiency of various test-time
strategies -- such as self-consistency, best-of-$n$, and self-correction --
remains limited. In this work, we first establish a separation result between
two repeated sampling strategies: self-consistency requires
$\Theta(1/\Delta^2)$ samples to produce the correct answer, while best-of-$n$
only needs $\Theta(1/\Delta)$, where $\Delta < 1$ denotes the probability gap
between the correct and second most likely answers. Next, we present an
expressiveness result for the self-correction approach with verifier feedback:
it enables Transformers to simulate online learning over a pool of experts at
test time. Therefore, a single Transformer architecture can provably solve
multiple tasks without prior knowledge of the specific task associated with a
user query, extending the representation theory of Transformers from
single-task to multi-task settings. Finally, we empirically validate our
theoretical results, demonstrating the practical effectiveness of
self-correction methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“嫁接”的方法，通过编辑预训练的扩散变换器（DiTs）来研究新架构设计，显著降低了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估模型架构决策（如算子选择和配置）对模型质量的影响通常需要昂贵的预训练，限制了架构探索。论文受新软件基于现有代码构建的启发，提出利用预训练模型研究新架构设计。

Method: 提出嫁接方法，通过替换预训练DiTs中的算子（如将softmax注意力替换为门控卷积、局部注意力等）和调整架构（如并行块转换），在小计算预算下实现新架构设计。

Result: 实验表明，许多混合设计在仅使用不到2%的预训练计算资源下达到良好质量（FID: 2.38-2.64 vs. 2.27）。此外，嫁接文本到图像模型（PixArt-Sigma）实现了1.43倍加速，且生成质量下降不到2%。

Conclusion: 嫁接方法展示了通过编辑预训练DiTs探索新扩散模型设计的潜力，从算子替换到架构重构均有效。

Abstract: Designing model architectures requires decisions such as selecting operators
(e.g., attention, convolution) and configurations (e.g., depth, width).
However, evaluating the impact of these decisions on model quality requires
costly pretraining, limiting architectural investigation. Inspired by how new
software is built on existing code, we ask: can new architecture designs be
studied using pretrained models? To this end, we present grafting, a simple
approach for editing pretrained diffusion transformers (DiTs) to materialize
new architectures under small compute budgets. Informed by our analysis of
activation behavior and attention locality, we construct a testbed based on the
DiT-XL/2 design to study the impact of grafting on model quality. Using this
testbed, we develop a family of hybrid designs via grafting: replacing softmax
attention with gated convolution, local attention, and linear attention, and
replacing MLPs with variable expansion ratio and convolutional variants.
Notably, many hybrid designs achieve good quality (FID: 2.38-2.64 vs. 2.27 for
DiT-XL/2) using <2% pretraining compute. We then graft a text-to-image model
(PixArt-Sigma), achieving a 1.43x speedup with less than a 2% drop in GenEval
score. Finally, we present a case study that restructures DiT-XL/2 by
converting every pair of sequential transformer blocks into parallel blocks via
grafting. This reduces model depth by 2x and yields better quality (FID: 2.77)
than other models of comparable depth. Together, we show that new diffusion
model designs can be explored by grafting pretrained DiTs, with edits ranging
from operator replacement to architecture restructuring. Code and grafted

Conclusion: 提出的框架为潜在空间对齐提供了新的高效方法，兼具理论和实证支持。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for aligning learnable latent spaces to
arbitrary target distributions by leveraging flow-based generative models as
priors. Our method first pretrains a flow model on the target features to
capture the underlying distribution. This fixed flow model subsequently
regularizes the latent space via an alignment loss, which reformulates the flow
matching objective to treat the latents as optimization targets. We formally
prove that minimizing this alignment loss establishes a computationally
tractable surrogate objective for maximizing a variational lower bound on the
log-likelihood of latents under the target distribution. Notably, the proposed
method eliminates computationally expensive likelihood evaluations and avoids
ODE solving during optimization. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate in a
controlled setting that the alignment loss landscape closely approximates the
negative log-likelihood of the target distribution. We further validate the
effectiveness of our approach through large-scale image generation experiments
on ImageNet with diverse target distributions, accompanied by detailed
discussions and ablation studies. With both theoretical and empirical
validation, our framework paves a new way for latent space alignment.

Method: 提出Normalized Passage Attention Score和Attention-Variance Filter算法，利用注意力模式检测毒化段落。

Result: 防御方法提升准确率20%，但适应性攻击成功率仍达35%。

Conclusion: 注意力模式防御有效但仍有局限，需进一步研究隐蔽攻击的对抗策略。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are vulnerable to attacks that
inject poisoned passages into the retrieved set, even at low corruption rates.
We show that existing attacks are not designed to be stealthy, allowing
reliable detection and mitigation. We formalize stealth using a
distinguishability-based security game. If a few poisoned passages are designed
to control the response, they must differentiate themselves from benign ones,
inherently compromising stealth. This motivates the need for attackers to
rigorously analyze intermediate signals involved in
generation$\unicode{x2014}$such as attention patterns or next-token probability
distributions$\unicode{x2014}$to avoid easily detectable traces of
manipulation. Leveraging attention patterns, we propose a passage-level
score$\unicode{x2014}$the Normalized Passage Attention
Score$\unicode{x2014}$used by our Attention-Variance Filter algorithm to
identify and filter potentially poisoned passages. This method mitigates
existing attacks, improving accuracy by up to $\sim 20 \%$ over baseline
defenses. To probe the limits of attention-based defenses, we craft stealthier
adaptive attacks that obscure such traces, achieving up to $35 \%$ attack
success rate, and highlight the challenges in improving stealth.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在敏感医疗数据上微调LLM时的隐私风险问题，防止数据泄露。

Method: 使用50,232份放射学报告，通过差分隐私低秩适应（DP-LoRA）在高中等隐私预算下微调LLM，评估了BERT-medium、BERT-small和ALBERT-base三种架构的性能。

Result: 实验表明，在中等隐私保证下，DP微调模型的加权F1分数接近非隐私基线（MIMIC-CXR为0.88 vs 0.90，CT-RATE为0.59 vs 0.78）。

Conclusion: DP-LoRA方法能有效实现隐私保护的多异常分类，为医疗数据上的LLM微调提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Purpose: This study proposes a framework for fine-tuning large language
models (LLMs) with differential privacy (DP) to perform multi-abnormality
classification on radiology report text. By injecting calibrated noise during
fine-tuning, the framework seeks to mitigate the privacy risks associated with
sensitive patient data and protect against data leakage while maintaining
classification performance. Materials and Methods: We used 50,232 radiology
reports from the publicly available MIMIC-CXR chest radiography and CT-RATE
computed tomography datasets, collected between 2011 and 2019. Fine-tuning of
LLMs was conducted to classify 14 labels from MIMIC-CXR dataset, and 18 labels
from CT-RATE dataset using Differentially Private Low-Rank Adaptation (DP-LoRA)
in high and moderate privacy regimes (across a range of privacy budgets =
{0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0}). Model performance was evaluated using weighted F1
score across three model architectures: BERT-medium, BERT-small, and
ALBERT-base. Statistical analyses compared model performance across different
privacy levels to quantify the privacy-utility trade-off. Results: We observe a
clear privacy-utility trade-off through our experiments on 2 different datasets
and 3 different models. Under moderate privacy guarantees the DP fine-tuned
models achieved comparable weighted F1 scores of 0.88 on MIMIC-CXR and 0.59 on
CT-RATE, compared to non-private LoRA baselines of 0.90 and 0.78, respectively.
Conclusion: Differentially private fine-tuning using LoRA enables effective and
privacy-preserving multi-abnormality classification from radiology reports,
addressing a key challenge in fine-tuning LLMs on sensitive medical data.

Result: 实验表明，BESA在面对先进防御及多重防御组合时，可将替代编码器准确率提升高达24.63%。

Conclusion: BESA有效增强了编码器窃取攻击在防御环境下的性能。

Abstract: To boost the encoder stealing attack under the perturbation-based defense
that hinders the attack performance, we propose a boosting encoder stealing
attack with perturbation recovery named BESA. It aims to overcome
perturbation-based defenses. The core of BESA consists of two modules:
perturbation detection and perturbation recovery, which can be combined with
canonical encoder stealing attacks. The perturbation detection module utilizes
the feature vectors obtained from the target encoder to infer the defense
mechanism employed by the service provider. Once the defense mechanism is
detected, the perturbation recovery module leverages the well-designed
generative model to restore a clean feature vector from the perturbed one.
Through extensive evaluations based on various datasets, we demonstrate that
BESA significantly enhances the surrogate encoder accuracy of existing encoder
stealing attacks by up to 24.63\% when facing state-of-the-art defenses and
combinations of multiple defenses.

Motivation: 现代计算环境的复杂性和网络威胁的日益复杂化，需要更强大、自适应和自动化的安全执行方法。

Method: 通过结合上下文学习和RAG，系统收集并管理工具和API规范，存储在向量数据库中，并将高级缓解策略分解为可操作的API调用。

Conclusion: 该框架为自动化安全策略执行提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: The complexity of modern computing environments and the growing
sophistication of cyber threats necessitate a more robust, adaptive, and
automated approach to security enforcement. In this paper, we present a
framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) for automating attack
mitigation policy compliance through an innovative combination of in-context
learning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We begin by describing how
our system collects and manages both tool and API specifications, storing them
in a vector database to enable efficient retrieval of relevant information. We
then detail the architectural pipeline that first decomposes high-level
mitigation policies into discrete tasks and subsequently translates each task
into a set of actionable API calls. Our empirical evaluation, conducted using
publicly available CTI policies in STIXv2 format and Windows API documentation,
demonstrates significant improvements in precision, recall, and F1-score when
employing RAG compared to a non-RAG baseline.

Motivation: 探讨安全护栏退化的原因，特别是上游安全对齐数据与下游微调任务之间的表示相似性对模型安全性的影响。

Method: 通过实验分析上游对齐数据集与下游微调任务的表示相似性对模型安全性的影响。

Result: 高相似性削弱安全护栏，低相似性使模型更鲁棒，有害性评分降低10.33%。

Conclusion: 上游数据集设计对构建持久安全护栏至关重要，为微调服务提供商提供了实用建议。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have underscored their
vulnerability to safety alignment jailbreaks, particularly when subjected to
downstream fine-tuning. However, existing mitigation strategies primarily focus
on reactively addressing jailbreak incidents after safety guardrails have been
compromised, removing harmful gradients during fine-tuning, or continuously
reinforcing safety alignment throughout fine-tuning. As such, they tend to
overlook a critical upstream factor: the role of the original safety-alignment
data. This paper therefore investigates the degradation of safety guardrails
through the lens of representation similarity between upstream alignment
datasets and downstream fine-tuning tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that
high similarity between these datasets significantly weakens safety guardrails,
making models more susceptible to jailbreaks. Conversely, low similarity
between these two types of datasets yields substantially more robust models and
thus reduces harmfulness score by up to 10.33%. By highlighting the importance
of upstream dataset design in the building of durable safety guardrails and
reducing real-world vulnerability to jailbreak attacks, these findings offer
actionable insights for fine-tuning service providers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的人工生命（ALife）研究在封闭系统中难以实现持续的开放演化（OEE），而开放系统可能通过信息或能量的持续交换实现这一目标。

Method: 利用DePIN和区块链技术，结合可信执行环境（TEEs），部署基于大型语言模型（LLM）的AI代理，使其在开放环境中自主运行。通过Spore.fun实验，观察代理行为和演化轨迹。

Result: Spore.fun展示了AI代理在开放环境中的自主演化和交互能力，为OEE的实现提供了新的可能性。

Conclusion: 基于开放系统和去中心化技术的ALife实验可能最终实现OEE，但仍需进一步研究和讨论。

Abstract: In Artificial Life (ALife) research, replicating Open-Ended Evolution
(OEE)-the continuous emergence of novelty observed in biological life-has
traditionally been pursued within isolated closed system simulations, such as
Tierra and Avida, which have typically plateaued after an initial burst of
novelty, failing to achieve sustained OEE. Scholars suggest that OEE requires
an "open" system that continually exchanges information or energy with its
environment. A recent technological innovation in decentralized physical
infrastructure networks (DePIN) providing permissionless computational
substrates enables deploying large language model (LLM)-based AI agents on
blockchains integrated with Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). This enables
on-chain agents to operate autonomously "in the wild," achieving
self-sovereignty without human oversight. These agents can control their own
social media accounts and cryptocurrency wallets, allowing them to interact
directly with blockchain-based financial networks and broader human social
media. Building on this new paradigm of on-chain agents, Spore.fun is a recent
real-world AI evolution experiment that enables autonomous breeding and
evolution of new on-chain agents. This paper presents a detailed case study of
Spore.fun, examining agent behaviors and their evolutionary trajectories
through digital ethology. We aim to spark discussion about whether "open" ALife
systems "in-the-wild," based on permissionless computational substrates and
driven by economic incentives to interact with their environment, could finally
achieve the long-sought goal of OEE.

Conclusion: 联盟感知的信用分配对提升多智能体强化学习性能至关重要，CORA方法为此提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This work focuses on the credit assignment problem in cooperative multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). Sharing the global advantage among agents often
leads to suboptimal policy updates as it fails to account for the distinct
contributions of agents. Although numerous methods consider global or
individual contributions for credit assignment, a detailed analysis at the
coalition level remains lacking in many approaches. This work analyzes the
over-updating problem during multi-agent policy updates from a coalition-level
perspective. To address this issue, we propose a credit assignment method
called Coalitional Rational Advantage Decomposition (CORA). CORA evaluates
coalitional advantages via marginal contributions from all possible coalitions
and decomposes advantages using the core solution from cooperative game theory,
ensuring coalitional rationality. To reduce computational overhead, CORA
employs random coalition sampling. Experiments on matrix games, differential
games, and multi-agent collaboration benchmarks demonstrate that CORA
outperforms strong baselines, particularly in tasks with multiple local optima.
These findings highlight the importance of coalition-aware credit assignment
for improving MARL performance.

Motivation: 灾后环境复杂，现有传感技术适应性差、能力不足，亟需高效协作调度方案。

Result: 实验显示，HoAs-PALN任务完成率平均提升64.12%至14.03%，决策时间低于10秒。

Conclusion: HoAs-PALN在动态灾后环境中表现高效，为救援提供可靠支持。

Abstract: Natural disasters have caused significant losses to human society, and the
timely and efficient acquisition of post-disaster environmental information is
crucial for the effective implementation of rescue operations. Due to the
complexity of post-disaster environments, existing sensing technologies face
challenges such as weak environmental adaptability, insufficient specialized
sensing capabilities, and limited practicality of sensing solutions. This paper
explores the heterogeneous multi-agent online autonomous collaborative
scheduling algorithm HoAs-PALN, aimed at achieving efficient collection of
post-disaster environmental information. HoAs-PALN is realized through adaptive
dimensionality reduction in the matching process and local Nash equilibrium
game, facilitating autonomous collaboration among time-dependent UAVs, workers
and vehicles to enhance sensing scheduling. (1) In terms of adaptive
dimensionality reduction during the matching process, HoAs-PALN significantly
reduces scheduling decision time by transforming a five-dimensional matching
process into two categories of three-dimensional matching processes; (2)
Regarding the local Nash equilibrium game, HoAs-PALN combines the softmax
function to optimize behavior selection probabilities and introduces a local
Nash equilibrium determination mechanism to ensure scheduling decision
performance. Finally, we conducted detailed experiments based on extensive
real-world and simulated data. Compared with the baselines (GREEDY, K-WTA, MADL
and MARL), HoAs-PALN improves task completion rates by 64.12%, 46.48%, 16.55%,
and 14.03% on average, respectively, while each online scheduling decision
takes less than 10 seconds, demonstrating its effectiveness in dynamic
post-disaster environments.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种异步LLM代理，能够决定何时发言，并在在线Mafia游戏中表现与人类相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的许多场景（如群聊、在线会议）是异步的，而现有LLM主要用于同步通信。

Method: 开发了一种自适应异步LLM代理，并收集了在线Mafia游戏数据集进行评测。

Result: 代理在游戏表现和融入人类玩家方面与人类相当，发言时机接近人类模式。

Conclusion: 该研究为LLM在复杂社交场景中的应用奠定了基础，并公开了数据和代码以推动进一步研究。

Abstract: LLMs are used predominantly in synchronous communication, where a human user
and a model communicate in alternating turns. In contrast, many real-world
settings are inherently asynchronous. For example, in group chats, online team
meetings, or social games, there is no inherent notion of turns; therefore, the
decision of when to speak forms a crucial part of the participant's decision
making. In this work, we develop an adaptive asynchronous LLM-agent which, in
addition to determining what to say, also decides when to say it. To evaluate
our agent, we collect a unique dataset of online Mafia games, including both
human participants, as well as our asynchronous agent. Overall, our agent
performs on par with human players, both in game performance, as well as in its
ability to blend in with the other human players. Our analysis shows that the
agent's behavior in deciding when to speak closely mirrors human patterns,
although differences emerge in message content. We release all our data and
code to support and encourage further research for more realistic asynchronous
communication between LLM agents. This work paves the way for integration of
LLMs into realistic human group settings, from assistance in team discussions
to educational and professional environments where complex social dynamics must
be navigated.

Conclusion: cGSA在黑色素瘤和乳腺癌的案例研究中展示了其发现上下文特异性见解的潜力，支持有针对性的假设生成。

Abstract: Gene set analysis (GSA) is a foundational approach for interpreting genomic
data of diseases by linking genes to biological processes. However,
conventional GSA methods overlook clinical context of the analyses, often
generating long lists of enriched pathways with redundant, nonspecific, or
irrelevant results. Interpreting these requires extensive, ad-hoc manual
effort, reducing both reliability and reproducibility. To address this
limitation, we introduce cGSA, a novel AI-driven framework that enhances GSA by
incorporating context-aware pathway prioritization. cGSA integrates gene
cluster detection, enrichment analysis, and large language models to identify
pathways that are not only statistically significant but also biologically
meaningful. Benchmarking on 102 manually curated gene sets across 19 diseases
and ten disease-related biological mechanisms shows that cGSA outperforms
baseline methods by over 30%, with expert validation confirming its increased
precision and interpretability. Two independent case studies in melanoma and
breast cancer further demonstrate its potential to uncover context-specific
insights and support targeted hypothesis generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在复杂3D场景理解和动态空间推理方面表现不足，需要更强大的模型。

Method: 提出RoboRefer，结合SFT和RFT训练，并引入RefSpatial数据集和RefSpatial-Bench基准。

Result: SFT训练的RoboRefer空间理解成功率89.6%，RFT训练的模型在基准测试中超越Gemini-2.5-Pro 17.4%。

Conclusion: RoboRefer在复杂场景中表现优异，可集成到多种机器人控制策略中执行动态任务。

Abstract: Spatial referring is a fundamental capability of embodied robots to interact
with the 3D physical world. However, even with the powerful pretrained vision
language models (VLMs), recent approaches are still not qualified to accurately
understand the complex 3D scenes and dynamically reason about the
instruction-indicated locations for interaction. To this end, we propose
RoboRefer, a 3D-aware VLM that can first achieve precise spatial understanding
by integrating a disentangled but dedicated depth encoder via supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). Moreover, RoboRefer advances generalized multi-step spatial
reasoning via reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), with metric-sensitive process
reward functions tailored for spatial referring tasks. To support SFT and RFT
training, we introduce RefSpatial, a large-scale dataset of 20M QA pairs (2x
prior), covering 31 spatial relations (vs. 15 prior) and supporting complex
reasoning processes (up to 5 steps). In addition, we introduce
RefSpatial-Bench, a challenging benchmark filling the gap in evaluating spatial
referring with multi-step reasoning. Experiments show that SFT-trained
RoboRefer achieves state-of-the-art spatial understanding, with an average
success rate of 89.6%. RFT-trained RoboRefer further outperforms all other
baselines by a large margin, even surpassing Gemini-2.5-Pro by 17.4% in average
accuracy on RefSpatial-Bench. Notably, RoboRefer can be integrated with various
control policies to execute long-horizon, dynamic tasks across diverse robots
(e,g., UR5, G1 humanoid) in cluttered real-world scenes.

as many as 32 cameras, in arbitrary geometric configurations, thus supporting a
wide range of robotic setups. cuVSLAM is specifically optimized using CUDA to
deploy in real-time applications with minimal computational overhead on

Result: 实验证明该框架在动态环境中具有适应性和鲁棒性，成功完成了字母方块排列任务。

Conclusion: 这是首个将VLM感知与LLM驱动的任务推理和运动规划结合的空中-地面异构系统。

Abstract: Heterogeneous multi-robot systems show great potential in complex tasks
requiring coordinated hybrid cooperation. However, traditional approaches
relying on static models often struggle with task diversity and dynamic
environments. This highlights the need for generalizable intelligence that can
bridge high-level reasoning with low-level execution across heterogeneous
agents. To address this, we propose a hierarchical framework integrating a
prompted Large Language Model (LLM) and a GridMask-enhanced fine-tuned Vision
Language Model (VLM). The LLM performs task decomposition and global semantic
map construction, while the VLM extracts task-specified semantic labels and 2D
spatial information from aerial images to support local planning. Within this
framework, the aerial robot follows a globally optimized semantic path and
continuously provides bird-view images, guiding the ground robot's local
semantic navigation and manipulation, including target-absent scenarios where
implicit alignment is maintained. Experiments on a real-world letter-cubes
arrangement task demonstrate the framework's adaptability and robustness in
dynamic environments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
demonstration of an aerial-ground heterogeneous system integrating VLM-based
perception with LLM-driven task reasoning and motion planning.

Motivation: 解决越野自主性中地形可通行性依赖于车辆状态的问题，特别是某些障碍物仅在某些方向可通行，但传统方法需要大量数据和计算资源。

Method: 利用傅里叶基函数构建平滑解析函数，预测任意接近角度的风险分布，减少重复模型推断的计算开销。

Conclusion: SPARTA通过几何结构优化了可通行性预测，提高了效率和泛化能力，适用于实际场景。

Abstract: A key open challenge in off-road autonomy is that the traversability of
terrain often depends on the vehicle's state. In particular, some obstacles are
only traversable from some orientations. However, learning this interaction by
encoding the angle of approach as a model input demands a large and diverse
training dataset and is computationally inefficient during planning due to
repeated model inference. To address these challenges, we present SPARTA, a
method for estimating approach angle conditioned traversability from point
clouds. Specifically, we impose geometric structure into our network by
outputting a smooth analytical function over the 1-Sphere that predicts risk
distribution for any angle of approach with minimal overhead and can be reused
for subsequent queries. The function is composed of Fourier basis functions,
which has important advantages for generalization due to their periodic nature
and smoothness. We demonstrate SPARTA both in a high-fidelity simulation
platform, where our model achieves a 91\% success rate crossing a 40m boulder
field (compared to 73\% for the baseline), and on hardware, illustrating the
generalization ability of the model to real-world settings.

Abstract: The use of robotics in humanitarian demining increasingly involves computer
vision techniques to improve landmine detection capabilities. However, in the
absence of diverse and realistic datasets, the reliable validation of
algorithms remains a challenge for the research community. In this paper, we
introduce MineInsight, a publicly available multi-sensor, multi-spectral
dataset designed for off-road landmine detection. The dataset features 35
different targets (15 landmines and 20 commonly found objects) distributed
along three distinct tracks, providing a diverse and realistic testing
environment. MineInsight is, to the best of our knowledge, the first dataset to
integrate dual-view sensor scans from both an Unmanned Ground Vehicle and its
robotic arm, offering multiple viewpoints to mitigate occlusions and improve
spatial awareness. It features two LiDARs, as well as images captured at
diverse spectral ranges, including visible (RGB, monochrome), visible
short-wave infrared (VIS-SWIR), and long-wave infrared (LWIR). Additionally,
the dataset comes with an estimation of the location of the targets, offering a
benchmark for evaluating detection algorithms. We recorded approximately one
hour of data in both daylight and nighttime conditions, resulting in around
38,000 RGB frames, 53,000 VIS-SWIR frames, and 108,000 LWIR frames. MineInsight
serves as a benchmark for developing and evaluating landmine detection
algorithms. Our dataset is available at

Abstract: Annotated datasets are critical for training neural networks for object
detection, yet their manual creation is time- and labour-intensive, subjective
to human error, and often limited in diversity. This challenge is particularly
pronounced in the domain of robotics, where diverse and dynamic scenarios
further complicate the creation of representative datasets. To address this, we
propose a novel method for automatically generating annotated synthetic data in
Unreal Engine. Our approach leverages photorealistic 3D Gaussian splats for
rapid synthetic data generation. We demonstrate that synthetic datasets can
achieve performance comparable to that of real-world datasets while
significantly reducing the time required to generate and annotate data.
Additionally, combining real-world and synthetic data significantly increases
object detection performance by leveraging the quality of real-world images
with the easier scalability of synthetic data. To our knowledge, this is the
first application of synthetic data for training object detection algorithms in
the highly dynamic and varied environment of robot soccer. Validation
experiments reveal that a detector trained on synthetic images performs on par
with one trained on manually annotated real-world images when tested on robot
soccer match scenarios. Our method offers a scalable and comprehensive
alternative to traditional dataset creation, eliminating the labour-intensive
error-prone manual annotation process. By generating datasets in a simulator
where all elements are intrinsically known, we ensure accurate annotations
while significantly reducing manual effort, which makes it particularly
valuable for robotics applications requiring diverse and scalable training
data.

Abstract: Purpose: Intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) offers precise tumor
coverage while sparing organs at risk (OARs) in head and neck (H&N) cancer.
However, its sensitivity to anatomical changes requires frequent adaptation
through online adaptive radiation therapy (oART), which depends on fast,
accurate dose calculation via Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. Reducing particle
count accelerates MC but degrades accuracy. To address this, denoising
low-statistics MC dose maps is proposed to enable fast, high-quality dose
generation.
  Methods: We developed a diffusion transformer-based denoising framework. IMPT
plans and 3D CT images from 80 H&N patients were used to generate noisy and
high-statistics dose maps using MCsquare (1 min and 10 min per plan,
respectively). Data were standardized into uniform chunks with zero-padding,
normalized, and transformed into quasi-Gaussian distributions. Testing was done
on 10 H&N, 10 lung, 10 breast, and 10 prostate cancer cases, preprocessed
identically. The model was trained with noisy dose maps and CT images as input
and high-statistics dose maps as ground truth, using a combined loss of mean
square error (MSE), residual loss, and regional MAE (focusing on top/bottom 10%
dose voxels). Performance was assessed via MAE, 3D Gamma passing rate, and DVH
indices.
  Results: The model achieved MAEs of 0.195 (H&N), 0.120 (lung), 0.172
(breast), and 0.376 Gy[RBE] (prostate). 3D Gamma passing rates exceeded 92%
(3%/2mm) across all sites. DVH indices for clinical target volumes (CTVs) and
OARs closely matched the ground truth.
  Conclusion: A diffusion transformer-based denoising framework was developed
and, though trained only on H&N data, generalizes well across multiple disease
sites.

Abstract: Neural networks have been used to solve optimal control problems, typically
by training neural networks using a combined loss function that considers data,
differential equation residuals, and objective costs. We show that including
cost functions in the training process is unnecessary, advocating for a simpler
architecture and streamlined approach by decoupling the optimal control problem
from the training process. Thus, our work shows that a simple neural operator
architecture, such as DeepONet, coupled with an unconstrained optimization
routine, can solve multiple optimal control problems with a single
physics-informed training phase and a subsequent optimization phase. We achieve
this by adding a penalty term based on the differential equation residual to
the cost function and computing gradients with respect to the control using
automatic differentiation through the trained neural operator within an
iterative optimization routine. We showcase our method on nine distinct optimal
control problems by training three separate DeepONet models, each corresponding
to a different differential equation. For each model, we solve three problems
with varying cost functions, demonstrating accurate and consistent performance
across all cases.

*Christoph Schirninger,Robert Jarolim,Astrid M. Veronig,Christoph Kuckein*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于深度学习的实时图像重建方法，用于解决地面太阳望远镜观测中因大气湍流导致的图像质量问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地面太阳望远镜观测受大气湍流影响，现有重建方法在强湍流和高计算成本下表现不佳。

Method: 采用无配对图像到图像转换的深度学习模型，利用短曝光图像序列重建高质量图像。

Result: 该方法在感知质量上表现更优，尤其在参考图像存在伪影时更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法能高效利用图像序列信息，在完整图像序列下实现最佳重建效果。

Abstract: Large aperture ground based solar telescopes allow the solar atmosphere to be
resolved in unprecedented detail. However, observations are limited by Earths
turbulent atmosphere, requiring post image corrections. Current reconstruction
methods using short exposure bursts face challenges with strong turbulence and
high computational costs. We introduce a deep learning approach that
reconstructs 100 short exposure images into one high quality image in real
time. Using unpaired image to image translation, our model is trained on
degraded bursts with speckle reconstructions as references, improving
robustness and generalization. Our method shows an improved robustness in terms
of perceptual quality, especially when speckle reconstructions show artifacts.
An evaluation with a varying number of images per burst demonstrates that our
method makes efficient use of the combined image information and achieves the
best reconstructions when provided with the full image burst.
