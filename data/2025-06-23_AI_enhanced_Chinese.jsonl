A\nhierarchical RL strategy is employed to iteratively refine the generated text,\nenhancing both semantic accuracy and privacy.

The emergence\nof \"thinking\" through model-free RL is interesting as thinking actions neither\nproduce reward nor change the external world state to one where the agent is\nmore likely to get reward. This paper seeks to build a domain-independent\nunderstanding of when model-free RL will lead to \"thinking\" as a strategy for\nreward maximization. To build this understanding, we first introduce a\ntheoretical model which we call a \\textit{thought Markov decision process}\n(MDP). Thought MDPs minimally extend the classical MDP model to include an\nabstract notion of thought state and thought action. Using the thought MDP\nmodel, we prove the importance of policy initialization in determining whether\nor not thinking emerges and show formally that thought actions are equivalent\nto the agent choosing to perform a step of policy improvement before continuing\nto act. We then show that open-source LLMs satisfy the conditions that our\ntheory predicts are necessary for model-free RL to produce thinking-like\nbehavior. Finally, we hypothesize sufficient conditions that would enable\nthinking to be learned outside of language generation and introduce a toy\ndomain where a combination of multi-task pre-training and designated thought\nactions enable more data-efficient RL compared to non-thinking agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "论文探讨了模型无关强化学习（RL）如何通过训练产生类似推理的能力，提出了“思考MDP”理论模型，并验证了开源大语言模型（LLM）满足产生思考行为的条件。", "motivation": "研究模型无关RL在何种条件下会通过“思考”策略最大化奖励，因为“思考”行为既不直接产生奖励，也不改变外部世界状态。", "method": "引入“思考MDP”理论模型，证明策略初始化对“思考”行为的重要性，并验证开源LLM满足理论条件。", "result": "理论预测和实验验证表明，模型无关RL可以产生类似思考的行为，且在特定条件下能提升数据效率。", "conclusion": "论文为理解模型无关RL中“思考”行为的产生提供了理论基础，并展示了其在语言生成以外的潜在应用。"}}

To overcome this issue,\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) complements the static training-derived\nknowledge of LLMs with an external knowledge repository. RAG consists of three\nstages: indexing, retrieval, and generation. The retrieval stage of RAG becomes\na significant bottleneck in inference pipelines. In this stage, a user query is\nmapped to an embedding vector and an Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS)\nalgorithm searches for similar vectors in the database to identify relevant\nitems. Due to the large database sizes, ANNS incurs significant data movement\noverheads between the host and the storage system. To alleviate these\noverheads, prior works propose In-Storage Processing (ISP) techniques that\naccelerate ANNS by performing computations inside storage. However, existing\nworks that leverage ISP for ANNS (i) employ algorithms that are not tailored to\nISP systems, (ii) do not accelerate data retrieval operations for data selected\nby ANNS, and (iii) introduce significant hardware modifications, limiting\nperformance and hindering their adoption. We propose REIS, the first ISP system\ntailored for RAG that addresses these limitations with three key mechanisms.\nFirst, REIS employs a database layout that links database embedding vectors to\ntheir associated documents, enabling efficient retrieval. Second, it enables\nefficient ANNS by introducing an ISP-tailored data placement technique that\ndistributes embeddings across the planes of the storage system and employs a\nlightweight Flash Translation Layer.

First,\nthe communication and computing resource attributes of the collaborator in a\ntrusted state, along with historical collaboration data, are collected and\nrepresented using an attributed control flow graph (ACFG) that captures\ntrust-related semantic information and serves as a reference for comparison\nwith data collected during task execution. At each time slot of task execution,\nthe collaborator's communication and computing resource attributes, as well as\ntask completion effectiveness, are collected in real time and represented with\nan ACFG to convey their trust-related semantic information. A Siamese model,\nconsisting of two shared-parameter Structure2vec networks, is then employed to\nlearn the deep semantics of each pair of ACFGs and generate their embeddings.\nFinally, the similarity between the embeddings of each pair of ACFGs is\ncalculated to determine the collaborator's trust value at each time slot.
