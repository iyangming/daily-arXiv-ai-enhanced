### [1] [TIP-Search: Time-Predictable Inference Scheduling for Market Prediction under Uncertain Load](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08026)
*Xibai Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TIP-Search是一个时间可预测的推理调度框架，用于在不确定工作负载下进行实时市场预测，动态选择深度学习模型以满足延迟需求并最大化准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高频金融系统对延迟有严格要求，需要一种能够在不确定工作负载下动态选择模型的方法。

Method: TIP-Search离线分析延迟和泛化性能，在线进行任务感知选择，不依赖显式输入域标签。

Result: 在三个真实订单簿数据集上测试，TIP-Search比静态基线准确率提升8.5%，100%满足截止时间。

Conclusion: TIP-Search在不确定环境下实现了高效的低延迟金融推理。

Abstract: This paper proposes TIP-Search, a time-predictable inference scheduling
framework for real-time market prediction under uncertain workloads. Motivated
by the strict latency demands in high-frequency financial systems, TIP-Search
dynamically selects a deep learning model from a heterogeneous pool, aiming to
maximize predictive accuracy while satisfying per-task deadline constraints.
Our approach profiles latency and generalization performance offline, then
performs online task-aware selection without relying on explicit input domain
labels. We evaluate TIP-Search on three real-world limit order book datasets
(FI-2010, Binance BTC/USDT, LOBSTER AAPL) and demonstrate that it outperforms
static baselines with up to 8.5% improvement in accuracy and 100% deadline
satisfaction. Our results highlight the effectiveness of TIP-Search in robust
low-latency financial inference under uncertainty.

### [2] [Cognitive Weave: Synthesizing Abstracted Knowledge with a Spatio-Temporal Resonance Graph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08098)
*Akash Vishwakarma,Hojin Lee,Mohith Suresh,Priyam Shankar Sharma,Rahul Vishwakarma,Sparsh Gupta,Yuvraj Anupam Chauhan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Cognitive Weave的新型记忆框架，通过多层次的时空共振图（STRG）管理信息，显著提升了任务完成率和查询效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有记忆系统在结构灵活性、时间感知和从原始数据中合成高级见解方面存在局限，需要更先进的记忆架构来支持大型语言模型（LLM）代理的持续学习和动态适应。

Method: 采用多层次的时空共振图（STRG）管理语义丰富的见解粒子（IPs），并通过语义预言接口（SOI）动态丰富这些粒子。通过认知精炼过程合成见解聚合（IAs）。

Result: Cognitive Weave在长期规划任务、动态问答场景和多会话对话连贯性方面显著优于现有方法，任务完成率平均提高34%，查询延迟减少42%。

Conclusion: Cognitive Weave为LLM的记忆系统提供了创新解决方案，同时探讨了伦理问题和未来研究方向。

Abstract: The emergence of capable large language model (LLM) based agents necessitates
memory architectures that transcend mere data storage, enabling continuous
learning, nuanced reasoning, and dynamic adaptation. Current memory systems
often grapple with fundamental limitations in structural flexibility, temporal
awareness, and the ability to synthesize higher-level insights from raw
interaction data. This paper introduces Cognitive Weave, a novel memory
framework centered around a multi-layered spatio-temporal resonance graph
(STRG). This graph manages information as semantically rich insight particles
(IPs), which are dynamically enriched with resonance keys, signifiers, and
situational imprints via a dedicated semantic oracle interface (SOI). These IPs
are interconnected through typed relational strands, forming an evolving
knowledge tapestry. A key component of Cognitive Weave is the cognitive
refinement process, an autonomous mechanism that includes the synthesis of
insight aggregates (IAs) condensed, higher-level knowledge structures derived
from identified clusters of related IPs. We present comprehensive experimental
results demonstrating Cognitive Weave's marked enhancement over existing
approaches in long-horizon planning tasks, evolving question-answering
scenarios, and multi-session dialogue coherence. The system achieves a notable
34% average improvement in task completion rates and a 42% reduction in mean
query latency when compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, this
paper explores the ethical considerations inherent in such advanced memory
systems, discusses the implications for long-term memory in LLMs, and outlines
promising future research trajectories.

### [3] [SOP-Bench: Complex Industrial SOPs for Evaluating LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08119)
*Subhrangshu Nandi,Arghya Datta,Nikhil Vichare,Indranil Bhattacharya,Huzefa Raja,Jing Xu,Shayan Ray,Giuseppe Carenini,Abhi Srivastava,Aaron Chan,Man Ho Woo,Amar Kandola,Brandon Theresa,Francesco Carbone*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了SOP-Bench，一个用于测试LLM在复杂工业标准操作流程（SOPs）中表现的基准，发现当前LLM代理的成功率较低，并呼吁社区扩展该基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在复杂、长周期的工业SOPs中表现不佳，且缺乏公开的基准来评估其能力。

Method: 1. 开发合成数据生成框架以创建工业级SOPs；2. 构建包含1,800多个任务的SOP-Bench基准；3. 评估两种LLM代理架构（Function-Calling和ReAct Agents）。

Result: 两种代理的平均成功率分别为27%和48%，且在工具注册过多时错误率接近100%。

Conclusion: LLM代理的能力与工业SOPs需求存在显著差距，需针对特定领域优化架构和基准。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive general-purpose reasoning
and problem-solving abilities. However, they struggle with executing complex,
long-horizon workflows that demand strict adherence to Standard Operating
Procedures (SOPs), a critical requirement for real-world industrial automation.
Despite this need, there is a lack of public benchmarks that reflect the
complexity, structure, and domain-specific nuances of SOPs. To address this, we
present three main contributions. First, we introduce a synthetic data
generation framework to create realistic, industry-grade SOPs that rigorously
test the planning, reasoning, and tool-use capabilities of LLM-based agents.
Second, using this framework, we develop SOP-Bench, a benchmark of over 1,800
tasks across 10 industrial domains, each with APIs, tool interfaces, and
human-validated test cases. Third, we evaluate two prominent agent
architectures: Function-Calling and ReAct Agents, on SOP-Bench, observing
average success rates of only 27% and 48%, respectively. Remarkably, when the
tool registry is much larger than necessary, agents invoke incorrect tools
nearly 100% of the time. These findings underscore a substantial gap between
current agentic capabilities of LLMs and the demands of automating real-world
SOPs. Performance varies significantly by task and domain, highlighting the
need for domain-specific benchmarking and architectural choices before
deployment. SOP-Bench is publicly available at
http://sop-bench.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/. We also release the
prompts underpinning the data generation framework to support new
domain-specific SOP benchmarks. We invite the community to extend SOP-Bench
with SOPs from their industrial domains.

### [4] [The AI Imperative: Scaling High-Quality Peer Review in Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08134)
*Qiyao Wei,Samuel Holt,Jing Yang,Markus Wulfmeier,Mihaela van der Schaar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文主张利用AI辅助同行评审，以应对机器学习领域评审规模危机，提出AI作为协作工具的具体应用方向和研究议程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习领域论文投稿激增导致评审质量下降，需AI辅助提升评审效率和一致性。

Method: 提出利用大型语言模型（LLMs）辅助作者、评审人和领域主席，包括事实核查、评审指导和决策支持等。

Result: 论文未提供具体实验结果，但提出了研究议程和技术挑战。

Conclusion: 呼吁机器学习社区开发AI辅助评审系统，以保障科学验证的完整性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Peer review, the bedrock of scientific advancement in machine learning (ML),
is strained by a crisis of scale. Exponential growth in manuscript submissions
to premier ML venues such as NeurIPS, ICML, and ICLR is outpacing the finite
capacity of qualified reviewers, leading to concerns about review quality,
consistency, and reviewer fatigue. This position paper argues that AI-assisted
peer review must become an urgent research and infrastructure priority. We
advocate for a comprehensive AI-augmented ecosystem, leveraging Large Language
Models (LLMs) not as replacements for human judgment, but as sophisticated
collaborators for authors, reviewers, and Area Chairs (ACs). We propose
specific roles for AI in enhancing factual verification, guiding reviewer
performance, assisting authors in quality improvement, and supporting ACs in
decision-making. Crucially, we contend that the development of such systems
hinges on access to more granular, structured, and ethically-sourced peer
review process data. We outline a research agenda, including illustrative
experiments, to develop and validate these AI assistants, and discuss
significant technical and ethical challenges. We call upon the ML community to
proactively build this AI-assisted future, ensuring the continued integrity and
scalability of scientific validation, while maintaining high standards of peer
review.

### [5] [Compiling Metric Temporal Answer Set Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08150)
*Arvid Becker,Pedro Cabalar,Martin Diéguez,Javier Romero,Susana Hahn,Torsten Schaub*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种计算方法来处理Metric ASP中的定量时间约束，通过外部处理时间相关约束，解决了时间粒度对性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Metric ASP中处理细粒度时间约束时的可扩展性问题，避免时间精度对性能的负面影响。

Method: 利用ASP的扩展（如差异约束）外部处理时间相关约束，从而解耦时间粒度与Metric ASP的性能。

Result: 实现了不受时间精度影响的解决方案，显著提升了处理时间约束时的可扩展性。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了Metric ASP中的时间约束问题，为处理定量时间约束提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: We develop a computational approach to Metric Answer Set Programming (ASP) to
allow for expressing quantitative temporal constrains, like durations and
deadlines. A central challenge is to maintain scalability when dealing with
fine-grained timing constraints, which can significantly exacerbate ASP's
grounding bottleneck. To address this issue, we leverage extensions of ASP with
difference constraints, a simplified form of linear constraints, to handle
time-related aspects externally. Our approach effectively decouples metric ASP
from the granularity of time, resulting in a solution that is unaffected by
time precision.

### [6] [AstroCompress: A benchmark dataset for multi-purpose compression of astronomical data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08306)
*Tuan Truong,Rithwik Sudharsan,Yibo Yang,Peter Xiangyuan Ma,Ruihan Yang,Stephan Mandt,Joshua S. Bloom*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出AstroCompress，一种用于天体物理数据的神经压缩方法，通过端到端学习提升数据压缩效率，超越传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 天文观测站因环境限制导致数据传输能力有限，改进无损压缩技术可显著提升科学数据获取效率。

Method: 提出AstroCompress挑战，包含五个数据集，并对比了三种神经和四种非神经压缩方法。

Result: 神经压缩技术在天文数据无损压缩中表现优异，有望提升观测站数据收集能力。

Conclusion: 神经压缩技术具有潜力，未来可探索有损压缩方法。

Abstract: The site conditions that make astronomical observatories in space and on the
ground so desirable -- cold and dark -- demand a physical remoteness that leads
to limited data transmission capabilities. Such transmission limitations
directly bottleneck the amount of data acquired and in an era of costly modern
observatories, any improvements in lossless data compression has the potential
scale to billions of dollars worth of additional science that can be
accomplished on the same instrument. Traditional lossless methods for
compressing astrophysical data are manually designed. Neural data compression,
on the other hand, holds the promise of learning compression algorithms
end-to-end from data and outperforming classical techniques by leveraging the
unique spatial, temporal, and wavelength structures of astronomical images.
This paper introduces AstroCompress: a neural compression challenge for
astrophysics data, featuring four new datasets (and one legacy dataset) with
16-bit unsigned integer imaging data in various modes: space-based,
ground-based, multi-wavelength, and time-series imaging. We provide code to
easily access the data and benchmark seven lossless compression methods (three
neural and four non-neural, including all practical state-of-the-art
algorithms). Our results on lossless compression indicate that lossless neural
compression techniques can enhance data collection at observatories, and
provide guidance on the adoption of neural compression in scientific
applications. Though the scope of this paper is restricted to lossless
compression, we also comment on the potential exploration of lossy compression
methods in future studies.

*Manooshree Patel,Rayna Bhattacharyya,Thomas Lu,Arnav Mehta,Niels Voss,Narges Norouzi,Gireeja Ranade*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LeanTutor是一个基于大型语言模型（LLM）的数学证明辅导系统，通过自然语言交互、形式化验证和生成下一步指导来帮助学生。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个能够与学生自然交互、验证数学证明并提供指导的智能辅导系统。

Method: 系统由三个模块组成：自动形式化/证明检查器、下一步生成器和自然语言反馈生成器。

Result: 自动形式化模块在正确证明中准确形式化了57%的步骤，并在错误证明中识别了30%的错误步骤。反馈生成器在自然语言提示生成上表现优于基线。

Conclusion: LeanTutor展示了LLM在数学教育中的潜力，能够有效辅助学生完成证明任务。

Abstract: We present LeanTutor, a Large Language Model (LLM)-based tutoring system for
math proofs. LeanTutor interacts with the student in natural language, formally
verifies student-written math proofs in Lean, generates correct next steps, and
provides the appropriate instructional guidance. LeanTutor is composed of three
modules: (i) an autoformalizer/proof-checker, (ii) a next-step generator, and
(iii) a natural language feedback generator. The first module faithfully
autoformalizes student proofs into Lean and verifies proof accuracy via
successful code compilation. If the proof has an error, the incorrect step is
identified. The next-step generator module outputs a valid next Lean tactic for
incorrect proofs via LLM-based candidate generation and proof search. The
feedback generator module leverages Lean data to produce a
pedagogically-motivated natural language hint for the student user. To evaluate
our system, we introduce PeanoBench, a human-written dataset derived from the
Natural Numbers Game, consisting of 371 Peano Arithmetic proofs, where each
natural language proof step is paired with the corresponding logically
equivalent tactic in Lean. The Autoformalizer correctly formalizes 57% of
tactics in correct proofs and accurately identifies the incorrect step in 30%
of incorrect proofs. In generating natural language hints for erroneous proofs,
LeanTutor outperforms a simple baseline on accuracy and relevance metrics.

*Amur Ghose,Andrew B. Kahng,Sayak Kundu,Zhiang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ORFS-agent是一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的迭代优化代理，用于自动化硬件设计流程中的参数调优，显著优于传统贝叶斯优化方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 集成电路设计流程涉及大量参数配置，微小变化可能对性能、功耗和面积产生重大影响。LLM的进展为高维优化任务提供了新的学习和推理机会。

Method: ORFS-agent通过自适应探索参数配置，结合自然语言目标进行多目标优化，无需额外微调即可与前沿LLM集成。

Result: 在两个技术节点和多个电路基准测试中，ORFS-agent将布线长度和有效时钟周期改善了13%以上，同时减少了40%的优化迭代次数。

Conclusion: ORFS-agent展示了高效、灵活且可解释的多目标优化框架，适用于复杂硬件设计流程。

Abstract: Machine learning has been widely used to optimize complex engineering
workflows across numerous domains. In the context of integrated circuit design,
modern flows (e.g., going from a register-transfer level netlist to physical
layouts) involve extensive configuration via thousands of parameters, and small
changes to these parameters can have large downstream impacts on desired
outcomes - namely design performance, power, and area. Recent advances in Large
Language Models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for learning and reasoning
within such high-dimensional optimization tasks. In this work, we introduce
ORFS-agent, an LLM-based iterative optimization agent that automates parameter
tuning in an open-source hardware design flow. ORFS-agent adaptively explores
parameter configurations, demonstrating clear improvements over standard
Bayesian optimization approaches in terms of resource efficiency and final
design metrics. Our empirical evaluations on two different technology nodes and
a range of circuit benchmarks indicate that ORFS-agent can improve both routed
wirelength and effective clock period by over 13%, all while using 40% fewer
optimization iterations. Moreover, by following natural language objectives to
trade off certain metrics for others, ORFS-agent demonstrates a flexible and
interpretable framework for multi-objective optimization. Crucially, RFS-agent
is modular and model-agnostic, and can be plugged in to any frontier LLM
without any further fine-tuning.

### [9] [FloorplanMAE:A self-supervised framework for complete floorplan generation from partial inputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08363)
*Jun Yin,Jing Zhong,Pengyu Zeng,Peilin Li,Miao Zhang,Ran Luo,Shuai Lu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出FloorplanMAE，一种自监督学习框架，用于从不完整的平面图恢复完整平面图，提升设计效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 建筑设计中的平面图设计是动态迭代过程，预测完整平面图能显著提升效率，减少重复修改工作量。

Method: 提出基于Masked Autoencoders (MAE)的方法，通过掩码部分平面图并训练轻量级Vision Transformer (ViT)进行重建。

Result: 实验表明FloorplanMAE能从不完整平面图生成高质量完整平面图，优于现有基准。

Conclusion: FloorplanMAE为平面图生成提供了可扩展解决方案，具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: In the architectural design process, floorplan design is often a dynamic and
iterative process. Architects progressively draw various parts of the floorplan
according to their ideas and requirements, continuously adjusting and refining
throughout the design process. Therefore, the ability to predict a complete
floorplan from a partial one holds significant value in the design process.
Such prediction can help architects quickly generate preliminary designs,
improve design efficiency, and reduce the workload associated with repeated
modifications. To address this need, we propose FloorplanMAE, a self-supervised
learning framework for restoring incomplete floor plans into complete ones.
First, we developed a floor plan reconstruction dataset, FloorplanNet,
specifically trained on architectural floor plans. Secondly, we propose a floor
plan reconstruction method based on Masked Autoencoders (MAE), which
reconstructs missing parts by masking sections of the floor plan and training a
lightweight Vision Transformer (ViT). We evaluated the reconstruction accuracy
of FloorplanMAE and compared it with state-of-the-art benchmarks. Additionally,
we validated the model using real sketches from the early stages of
architectural design. Experimental results show that the FloorplanMAE model can
generate high-quality complete floor plans from incomplete partial plans. This
framework provides a scalable solution for floor plan generation, with broad
application prospects.

*Leheng Sheng,An Zhang,Zijian Wu,Weixiang Zhao,Changshuo Shen,Yi Zhang,Xiang Wang,Tat-Seng Chua*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 大型推理模型（LRMs）能自动为更难的问题分配更多推理资源（推理标记数），其机制与模型激活中的预分配方向向量相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LRMs自动分配推理强度的现象及其内部机制。

Method: 通过模型激活分析，发现推理强度由预分配方向向量控制，并通过线性探针预测推理标记数。

Result: 方向向量的大小调节推理强度，调整向量可改变推理标记数和性能。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LRMs推理的内部机制，并提供了控制推理行为的实用工具。

Abstract: Recent studies empirically reveal that large reasoning models (LRMs) can
automatically allocate more reasoning strengths (i.e., the number of reasoning
tokens) for harder problems, exhibiting difficulty-awareness for better task
performance. While this automatic reasoning strength allocation phenomenon has
been widely observed, its underlying mechanism remains largely unexplored. To
this end, we provide explanations for this phenomenon from the perspective of
model activations. We find evidence that LRMs pre-plan the reasoning strengths
in their activations even before generation, with this reasoning strength
causally controlled by the magnitude of a pre-allocated directional vector.
Specifically, we show that the number of reasoning tokens is predictable solely
based on the question activations using linear probes, indicating that LRMs
estimate the required reasoning strength in advance. We then uncover that LRMs
encode this reasoning strength through a pre-allocated directional vector
embedded in the activations of the model, where the vector's magnitude
modulates the reasoning strength. Subtracting this vector can lead to reduced
reasoning token number and performance, while adding this vector can lead to
increased reasoning token number and even improved performance. We further
reveal that this direction vector consistently yields positive reasoning length
prediction, and it modifies the logits of end-of-reasoning token </think> to
affect the reasoning length. Finally, we demonstrate two potential applications
of our findings: overthinking behavior detection and enabling efficient
reasoning on simple problems. Our work provides new insights into the internal
mechanisms of reasoning in LRMs and offers practical tools for controlling
their reasoning behaviors. Our code is available at
https://github.com/AlphaLab-USTC/LRM-plans-CoT.

TL;DR: SafeCoT是一个轻量级、可解释的框架，通过基于规则的思维链监督改进视觉语言模型（VLMs）的拒绝行为，减少过度拒绝并增强泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险或模糊场景中，确保VLMs的安全和适当响应是一个关键挑战。

Method: SafeCoT利用基于规则的思维链监督，通过最小化监督帮助模型推理安全风险并做出上下文感知的拒绝。

Result: 实验表明，SafeCoT显著减少了过度拒绝并提高了泛化能力，即使在有限训练数据下也表现良好。

Conclusion: SafeCoT为对齐VLMs与安全关键目标提供了一种可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Ensuring safe and appropriate responses from vision-language models (VLMs)
remains a critical challenge, particularly in high-risk or ambiguous scenarios.
We introduce SafeCoT, a lightweight, interpretable framework that leverages
rule-based chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision to improve refusal behavior in
VLMs. Unlike prior methods that rely on large-scale safety annotations or
complex modeling, SafeCoT uses minimal supervision to help models reason about
safety risks and make context-aware refusals. Experiments across multiple
benchmarks show that SafeCoT significantly reduces overrefusal and enhances
generalization, even with limited training data. Our approach offers a scalable
solution for aligning VLMs with safety-critical objectives.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的图后门攻击方法，通过插入单个虚假用户节点，以隐蔽方式提升目标物品对目标用户的曝光率，同时减少对推荐系统性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图推荐系统在面对攻击时存在低隐蔽性和高破坏性的问题，需要一种更隐蔽且破坏性更小的攻击方法。

Method: 设计了一个单节点触发器生成器，仅插入一个虚假用户节点即可暴露多个目标物品，并引入约束条件以减少对无关节点的影响。

Result: 实验表明，目标物品对99%的目标用户曝光率不低于50%，同时对推荐系统性能的影响控制在约5%以内。

Conclusion: 该方法在提升目标物品曝光率的同时，有效降低了攻击对推荐系统的破坏性。

Abstract: Graph recommendation systems have been widely studied due to their ability to
effectively capture the complex interactions between users and items. However,
these systems also exhibit certain vulnerabilities when faced with attacks. The
prevailing shilling attack methods typically manipulate recommendation results
by injecting a large number of fake nodes and edges. However, such attack
strategies face two primary challenges: low stealth and high destructiveness.
To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel graph backdoor attack
method that aims to enhance the exposure of target items to the target user in
a covert manner, without affecting other unrelated nodes. Specifically, we
design a single-node trigger generator, which can effectively expose multiple
target items to the target user by inserting only one fake user node.
Additionally, we introduce constraint conditions between the target nodes and
irrelevant nodes to mitigate the impact of fake nodes on the recommendation
system's performance. Experimental results show that the exposure of the target
items reaches no less than 50% in 99% of the target users, while the impact on
the recommendation system's performance is controlled within approximately 5%.

Result: 在概念必要性映射任务中，F1分数达到0.97，远超人工基准0.68。

Conclusion: 该框架能高效扩展分类法对齐，同时保持高质量映射，并在模糊案例中保留专家监督。

Abstract: Having a unified, coherent taxonomy is essential for effective knowledge
representation in domain-specific applications as diverse terminologies need to
be mapped to underlying concepts. Traditional manual approaches to taxonomy
alignment rely on expert review of concept pairs, but this becomes
prohibitively expensive and time-consuming at scale, while subjective
interpretations often lead to expert disagreements. Existing automated methods
for taxonomy alignment have shown promise but face limitations in handling
nuanced semantic relationships and maintaining consistency across different
domains. These approaches often struggle with context-dependent concept
mappings and lack transparent reasoning processes. We propose a novel framework
that combines large language models (LLMs) with expert calibration and
iterative prompt optimization to automate taxonomy alignment. Our method
integrates expert-labeled examples, multi-stage prompt engineering, and human
validation to guide LLMs in generating both taxonomy linkages and supporting
rationales. In evaluating our framework on a domain-specific mapping task of
concept essentiality, we achieved an F1-score of 0.97, substantially exceeding
the human benchmark of 0.68. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in scaling taxonomy alignment while maintaining high-quality mappings
and preserving expert oversight for ambiguous cases.

Abstract: Recent advances toward foundation models for routing problems have shown
great potential of a unified deep model for various VRP variants. However, they
overlook the complex real-world customer distributions. In this work, we
advance the Multi-Task VRP (MTVRP) setting to the more realistic yet
challenging Multi-Task Multi-Distribution VRP (MTMDVRP) setting, and introduce
SHIELD, a novel model that leverages both sparsity and hierarchy principles.
Building on a deeper decoder architecture, we first incorporate the
Mixture-of-Depths (MoD) technique to enforce sparsity. This improves both
efficiency and generalization by allowing the model to dynamically select nodes
to use or skip each decoder layer, providing the needed capacity to adaptively
allocate computation for learning the task/distribution specific and shared
representations. We also develop a context-based clustering layer that exploits
the presence of hierarchical structures in the problems to produce better local
representations. These two designs inductively bias the network to identify key
features that are common across tasks and distributions, leading to
significantly improved generalization on unseen ones. Our empirical results
demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing methods on 9
real-world maps with 16 VRP variants each.

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning has long represented one of the most fundamental and
challenging frontiers in artificial intelligence research. In recent years,
large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant advances in this area.
This survey examines the development of mathematical reasoning abilities in
LLMs through two high-level cognitive phases: comprehension, where models gain
mathematical understanding via diverse pretraining strategies, and answer
generation, which has progressed from direct prediction to step-by-step
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. We review methods for enhancing mathematical
reasoning, ranging from training-free prompting to fine-tuning approaches such
as supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, and discuss recent work
on extended CoT and "test-time scaling". Despite notable progress, fundamental
challenges remain in terms of capacity, efficiency, and generalization. To
address these issues, we highlight promising research directions, including
advanced pretraining and knowledge augmentation techniques, formal reasoning
frameworks, and meta-generalization through principled learning paradigms. This
survey tries to provide some insights for researchers interested in enhancing
reasoning capabilities of LLMs and for those seeking to apply these techniques
to other domains.

*Christos Margadji,Sebastian W. Pattinson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CIPHER是一种结合视觉-语言-动作（VLA）模型的框架，用于工业控制，通过混合专家系统和检索增强生成技术实现人类推理能力，适用于数据稀缺的工业环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业过程需要鲁棒性和适应性，但传统AI控制依赖大量标注数据，难以泛化；基础模型缺乏工程所需的定量精度。

Method: CIPHER整合过程专家和回归模型，利用检索增强生成技术支持物理驱动的链式推理，无需显式标注即可生成精确指令。

Result: CIPHER在分布外任务中表现出强泛化能力，能解释决策并生成机器指令，支持透明决策。

Conclusion: CIPHER为工业环境中的自主系统提供了精确、透明和可信赖的基础。

Abstract: Industrial processes must be robust and adaptable, as environments and tasks
are often unpredictable, while operational errors remain costly and difficult
to detect. AI-based control systems offer a path forward, yet typically depend
on supervised learning with extensive labelled datasets, which limits their
ability to generalize across variable and data-scarce industrial settings.
Foundation models could enable broader reasoning and knowledge integration, but
rarely deliver the quantitative precision demanded by engineering applications.
Here, we introduceControl and Interpretation of Production via Hybrid Expertise
and Reasoning (CIPHER): a vision-language-action (VLA) model framework aiming
to replicate human-like reasoning for industrial control, instantiated in a
commercial-grade 3D printer. It integrates a process expert, a regression model
enabling quantitative characterization of system states required for
engineering tasks. CIPHER also incorporates retrieval-augmented generation to
access external expert knowledge and support physics-informed, chain-of-thought
reasoning. This hybrid architecture exhibits strong generalization to
out-of-distribution tasks. It interprets visual or textual inputs from process
monitoring, explains its decisions, and autonomously generates precise machine
instructions, without requiring explicit annotations. CIPHER thus lays the
foundations for autonomous systems that act with precision, reason with
context, and communicate decisions transparently, supporting safe and trusted
deployment in industrial settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在健康领域的应用引发了幻觉、偏见和伦理问题，需要一种负责任的方法来确保安全性和透明度。

Method: RHealthTwin通过Responsible Prompt Engine（RPE）动态提取预定义槽位，结构化输入以减少幻觉，并通过反馈循环优化提示结构。

Result: RHealthTwin在四个健康领域（心理支持、症状分诊、营养规划和活动指导）中表现优异，BLEU=0.41，ROUGE-L=0.63，BERTScore=0.89，伦理合规性超过90%。

Conclusion: RHealthTwin为健康领域的负责任LLM应用提供了前瞻性基础。

Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has created new possibilities for
digital twins in healthcare. However, the deployment of such systems in
consumer health contexts raises significant concerns related to hallucination,
bias, lack of transparency, and ethical misuse. In response to recommendations
from health authorities such as the World Health Organization (WHO), we propose
Responsible Health Twin (RHealthTwin), a principled framework for building and
governing AI-powered digital twins for well-being assistance. RHealthTwin
processes multimodal inputs that guide a health-focused LLM to produce safe,
relevant, and explainable responses. At the core of RHealthTwin is the
Responsible Prompt Engine (RPE), which addresses the limitations of traditional
LLM configuration. Conventionally, users input unstructured prompt and the
system instruction to configure the LLM, which increases the risk of
hallucination. In contrast, RPE extracts predefined slots dynamically to
structure both inputs. This guides the language model to generate responses
that are context aware, personalized, fair, reliable, and explainable for
well-being assistance. The framework further adapts over time through a
feedback loop that updates the prompt structure based on user satisfaction. We
evaluate RHealthTwin across four consumer health domains including mental
support, symptom triage, nutrition planning, and activity coaching. RPE
achieves state-of-the-art results with BLEU = 0.41, ROUGE-L = 0.63, and
BERTScore = 0.89 on benchmark datasets. Also, we achieve over 90% in ethical
compliance and instruction-following metrics using LLM-as-judge evaluation,
outperforming baseline strategies. We envision RHealthTwin as a forward-looking
foundation for responsible LLM-based applications in health and well-being.

Result: 在领域泛化和标签不平衡场景下达到最先进性能，适用于集中式和联邦设置。

Conclusion: FedTAIL通过优化协调和类感知正则化，显著提升了领域泛化能力。

Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) seeks to train models that perform reliably on
unseen target domains without access to target data during training. While
recent progress in smoothing the loss landscape has improved generalization,
existing methods often falter under long-tailed class distributions and
conflicting optimization objectives. We introduce FedTAIL, a federated domain
generalization framework that explicitly addresses these challenges through
sharpness-guided, gradient-aligned optimization. Our method incorporates a
gradient coherence regularizer to mitigate conflicts between classification and
adversarial objectives, leading to more stable convergence. To combat class
imbalance, we perform class-wise sharpness minimization and propose a
curvature-aware dynamic weighting scheme that adaptively emphasizes
underrepresented tail classes. Furthermore, we enhance conditional distribution
alignment by integrating sharpness-aware perturbations into entropy
regularization, improving robustness under domain shift. FedTAIL unifies
optimization harmonization, class-aware regularization, and conditional
alignment into a scalable, federated-compatible framework. Extensive
evaluations across standard domain generalization benchmarks demonstrate that
FedTAIL achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in the presence of
domain shifts and label imbalance, validating its effectiveness in both
centralized and federated settings. Code: https://github.com/sunnyinAI/FedTail

Method: 结合DRL与LLM推理，提出新型无人机轨迹规划框架，以实现安全、合规且经济可行的路径规划。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在数据收集率、避障、成功着陆、法规合规性和能源效率等多个指标上显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了低空经济网络约束下的无人机轨迹规划关键挑战。

Abstract: The rapid growth of the low-altitude economy has driven the widespread
adoption of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). This growing deployment presents
new challenges for UAV trajectory planning in complex urban environments.
However, existing studies often overlook key factors, such as urban airspace
constraints and economic efficiency, which are essential in low-altitude
economy contexts. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is regarded as a promising
solution to these issues, while its practical adoption remains limited by low
learning efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel UAV
trajectory planning framework that combines DRL with large language model (LLM)
reasoning to enable safe, compliant, and economically viable path planning.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
existing baselines across multiple metrics, including data collection rate,
collision avoidance, successful landing, regulatory compliance, and energy
efficiency. These results validate the effectiveness of our approach in
addressing UAV trajectory planning key challenges under constraints of the
low-altitude economy networking.

TL;DR: HGformer框架通过层次化图Transformer和强化学习算法，解决了两阶段Colonel Blotto游戏中资源分配的全局优化问题，显著提升了效率和对抗收益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 两阶段Colonel Blotto游戏中的序列依赖性和复杂图拓扑约束使传统方法难以实现全局最优策略。

Method: 提出HGformer框架，结合增强的图Transformer编码器和层次化决策模型，设计分层反馈强化学习算法。

Result: 实验表明HGformer在资源分配效率和对抗收益上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HGformer在复杂动态游戏场景中表现优异，解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Two-stage Colonel Blotto game represents a typical adversarial resource
allocation problem, in which two opposing agents sequentially allocate
resources in a network topology across two phases: an initial resource
deployment followed by multiple rounds of dynamic reallocation adjustments. The
sequential dependency between game stages and the complex constraints imposed
by the graph topology make it difficult for traditional approaches to attain a
globally optimal strategy. To address these challenges, we propose a
hierarchical graph Transformer framework called HGformer. By incorporating an
enhanced graph Transformer encoder with structural biases and a two-agent
hierarchical decision model, our approach enables efficient policy generation
in large-scale adversarial environments. Moreover, we design a layer-by-layer
feedback reinforcement learning algorithm that feeds the long-term returns from
lower-level decisions back into the optimization of the higher-level strategy,
thus bridging the coordination gap between the two decision-making stages.
Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to existing hierarchical
decision-making or graph neural network methods, HGformer significantly
improves resource allocation efficiency and adversarial payoff, achieving
superior overall performance in complex dynamic game scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对齐方法在处理高选择性和并发性模型时会导致状态空间爆炸，且无法充分表示真实世界中的并发行为。

Method: 使用有向Petri网展开动态计算部分序对齐（FoldA）。

Result: 在485个合成模型-日志对和19个真实/基准模型-日志对上评估，FoldA减少了排队状态数量并更准确地表示并发性，但计算时间较长。

Conclusion: FoldA技术有效解决了状态空间爆炸问题，并提供了更准确的并发行为表示，尽管计算时间有所增加。

Abstract: Conformance checking is a fundamental task of process mining, which
quantifies the extent to which the observed process executions match a
normative process model. The state-of-the-art approaches compute alignments by
exploring the state space formed by the synchronous product of the process
model and the trace. This often leads to state space explosion, particularly
when the model exhibits a high degree of choice and concurrency. Moreover, as
alignments inherently impose a sequential structure, they fail to fully
represent the concurrent behavior present in many real-world processes. To
address these limitations, this paper proposes a new technique for computing
partial-order alignments {on the fly using directed Petri net unfoldings, named
FoldA. We evaluate our technique on 485 synthetic model-log pairs and compare
it against Astar- and Dijkstra-alignments on 13 real-life model-log pairs and 6
benchmark pairs. The results show that our unfolding alignment, although it
requires more computation time, generally reduces the number of queued states
and provides a more accurate representation of concurrency.

Motivation: 开发通用控制器以提高计算和数据效率，解决多机器人控制中未见机器人泛化问题。

Method: 采用模块化循环架构，利用交互推断上下文信息，并在MuJoCo机器人上测试。

Result: 在未见动力学、运动学和拓扑结构的机器人上表现显著提升。

Conclusion: 模块化循环架构能有效提升机器人控制的泛化能力。

Abstract: A universal controller for any robot morphology would greatly improve
computational and data efficiency. By utilizing contextual information about
the properties of individual robots and exploiting their modular structure in
the architecture of deep reinforcement learning agents, steps have been made
towards multi-robot control. Generalization to new, unseen robots, however,
remains a challenge. In this paper we hypothesize that the relevant contextual
information is partially observable, but that it can be inferred through
interactions for better generalization to contexts that are not seen during
training. To this extent, we implement a modular recurrent architecture and
evaluate its generalization performance on a large set of MuJoCo robots. The
results show a substantial improved performance on robots with unseen dynamics,
kinematics, and topologies, in four different environments.

Result: 在多种推理基准测试中，CoVo性能达到或超过有监督强化学习。

Conclusion: CoVo为无需外部监督的推理学习提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances of Reinforcement Learning (RL) have highlighted its potential
in complex reasoning tasks, yet effective training often relies on external
supervision, which limits the broader applicability. In this work, we propose a
novel self-rewarding reinforcement learning framework to enhance Large Language
Model (LLM) reasoning by leveraging the consistency of intermediate reasoning
states across different reasoning trajectories. Our key insight is that correct
responses often exhibit consistent trajectory patterns in terms of model
likelihood: their intermediate reasoning states tend to converge toward their
own final answers (high consistency) with minimal deviation toward other
candidates (low volatility). Inspired by this observation, we introduce CoVo,
an intrinsic reward mechanism that integrates Consistency and Volatility via a
robust vector-space aggregation strategy, complemented by a curiosity bonus to
promote diverse exploration. CoVo enables LLMs to perform RL in a
self-rewarding manner, offering a scalable pathway for learning to reason
without external supervision. Extensive experiments on diverse reasoning
benchmarks show that CoVo achieves performance comparable to or even surpassing
supervised RL. Our code is available at https://github.com/sastpg/CoVo.

Result: 理论和实证结果表明，该方法在多种数据集上具有优越性和有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法避免了二值化过程的信息丢失，显著提升了条件独立性检验的性能。

Abstract: In many real-world scenarios, interested variables are often represented as
discretized values due to measurement limitations. Applying Conditional
Independence (CI) tests directly to such discretized data, however, can lead to
incorrect conclusions. To address this, recent advancements have sought to
infer the correct CI relationship between the latent variables through
binarizing observed data. However, this process inevitably results in a loss of
information, which degrades the test's performance. Motivated by this, this
paper introduces a sample-efficient CI test that does not rely on the
binarization process. We find that the independence relationships of latent
continuous variables can be established by addressing an over-identifying
restriction problem with Generalized Method of Moments (GMM). Based on this
insight, we derive an appropriate test statistic and establish its asymptotic
distribution correctly reflecting CI by leveraging nodewise regression.
Theoretical findings and Empirical results across various datasets demonstrate
that the superiority and effectiveness of our proposed test. Our code

Motivation: 传统基于观测数据的因果发现方法存在局限性，而基于变量元数据的知识驱动方法（如LLMs）虽具潜力，但结果不稳定且不可靠。

Method: 通过知识图谱提取信息丰富的元路径子图，并利用学习排序模型优化子图选择，将其整合到零样本提示中，提升LLMs的因果推理能力。

Result: 在生物医学和开放领域数据集上的实验表明，该方法在F1分数上比基线方法最高提升44.4分。

Conclusion: 结合KGs与LLMs的方法显著提升了知识驱动因果发现的可靠性和效果，为复杂系统中的因果推理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Inferring causal relationships between variable pairs is crucial for
understanding multivariate interactions in complex systems. Knowledge-based
causal discovery -- which involves inferring causal relationships by reasoning
over the metadata of variables (e.g., names or textual context) -- offers a
compelling alternative to traditional methods that rely on observational data.
However, existing methods using Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce
unstable and inconsistent results, compromising their reliability for causal
inference. To address this, we introduce a novel approach that integrates
Knowledge Graphs (KGs) with LLMs to enhance knowledge-based causal discovery.
Our approach identifies informative metapath-based subgraphs within KGs and
further refines the selection of these subgraphs using Learning-to-Rank-based
models. The top-ranked subgraphs are then incorporated into zero-shot prompts,
improving the effectiveness of LLMs in inferring the causal relationship.
Extensive experiments on biomedical and open-domain datasets demonstrate that
our method outperforms most baselines by up to 44.4 points in F1 scores,
evaluated across diverse LLMs and KGs. Our code and datasets are available on

Abstract: Data science aims to extract insights from data to support decision-making
processes. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as
assistants for data science, by suggesting ideas, techniques and small code
snippets, or for the interpretation of results and reporting. Proper automation
of some data-science activities is now promised by the rise of LLM agents,
i.e., AI systems powered by an LLM equipped with additional affordances--such
as code execution and knowledge bases--that can perform self-directed actions
and interact with digital environments. In this paper, we survey the evaluation
of LLM assistants and agents for data science. We find (1) a dominant focus on
a small subset of goal-oriented activities, largely ignoring data management
and exploratory activities; (2) a concentration on pure assistance or fully
autonomous agents, without considering intermediate levels of human-AI
collaboration; and (3) an emphasis on human substitution, therefore neglecting
the possibility of higher levels of automation thanks to task transformation.

Abstract: This study explores the neural and behavioral consequences of LLM-assisted
essay writing. Participants were divided into three groups: LLM, Search Engine,
and Brain-only (no tools). Each completed three sessions under the same
condition. In a fourth session, LLM users were reassigned to Brain-only group
(LLM-to-Brain), and Brain-only users were reassigned to LLM condition
(Brain-to-LLM). A total of 54 participants took part in Sessions 1-3, with 18
completing session 4. We used electroencephalography (EEG) to assess cognitive
load during essay writing, and analyzed essays using NLP, as well as scoring
essays with the help from human teachers and an AI judge. Across groups, NERs,
n-gram patterns, and topic ontology showed within-group homogeneity. EEG
revealed significant differences in brain connectivity: Brain-only participants
exhibited the strongest, most distributed networks; Search Engine users showed
moderate engagement; and LLM users displayed the weakest connectivity.
Cognitive activity scaled down in relation to external tool use. In session 4,
LLM-to-Brain participants showed reduced alpha and beta connectivity,
indicating under-engagement. Brain-to-LLM users exhibited higher memory recall
and activation of occipito-parietal and prefrontal areas, similar to Search
Engine users. Self-reported ownership of essays was the lowest in the LLM group
and the highest in the Brain-only group. LLM users also struggled to accurately
quote their own work. While LLMs offer immediate convenience, our findings
highlight potential cognitive costs. Over four months, LLM users consistently
underperformed at neural, linguistic, and behavioral levels. These results
raise concerns about the long-term educational implications of LLM reliance and
underscore the need for deeper inquiry into AI's role in learning.

Result: 在四个经典MOCOP基准测试中，POCCO表现出显著优势和强泛化能力。

Conclusion: POCCO通过自适应模型选择和偏好优化，有效解决了现有方法的局限性，提升了性能。

Abstract: Recent deep reinforcement learning methods have achieved remarkable success
in solving multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems (MOCOPs) by
decomposing them into multiple subproblems, each associated with a specific
weight vector. However, these methods typically treat all subproblems equally
and solve them using a single model, hindering the effective exploration of the
solution space and thus leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome the
limitation, we propose POCCO, a novel plug-and-play framework that enables
adaptive selection of model structures for subproblems, which are subsequently
optimized based on preference signals rather than explicit reward values.
Specifically, we design a conditional computation block that routes subproblems
to specialized neural architectures. Moreover, we propose a preference-driven
optimization algorithm that learns pairwise preferences between winning and
losing solutions. We evaluate the efficacy and versatility of POCCO by applying
it to two state-of-the-art neural methods for MOCOPs. Experimental results
across four classic MOCOP benchmarks demonstrate its significant superiority
and strong generalization.

Abstract: Traffic simulators are widely used to study the operational efficiency of
road infrastructure, but their rule-based approach limits their ability to
mimic real-world driving behavior. Traffic intersections are critical
components of the road infrastructure, both in terms of safety risk (nearly 28%
of fatal crashes and 58% of nonfatal crashes happen at intersections) as well
as the operational efficiency of a road corridor. This raises an important
question: can we create a data-driven simulator that can mimic the macro- and
micro-statistics of the driving behavior at a traffic intersection? Deep
Generative Modeling-based trajectory prediction models provide a good starting
point to model the complex dynamics of vehicles at an intersection. But they
are not tested in a "live" micro-simulation scenario and are not evaluated on
traffic engineering-related metrics. In this study, we propose traffic
engineering-related metrics to evaluate generative trajectory prediction models
and provide a simulation-in-the-loop pipeline to do so. We also provide a
multi-headed self-attention-based trajectory prediction model that incorporates
the signal information, which outperforms our previous models on the evaluation
metrics.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于深度生成模型的交通路口动态分析工具，通过在线微模拟评估模型性能，并引入新指标以更好地反映交通规则遵守情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 交通路口是城市路网的关键，但易发生事故。现有模型仅关注轨迹重建误差，缺乏对交通工程特定问题（如闯红灯）的评估。

Method: 训练多车辆轨迹预测模型，使用真实路口数据，并在微模拟器中在线评估模型性能，引入新指标分析违规行为。

Result: 即使输入理想轨迹且重建误差低，模型生成的轨迹仍可能违反交通规则。新指标能有效捕捉这些行为。

Conclusion: 新工具和指标为交通工程提供了更全面的模型评估方法，有助于提升路口安全与效率。

Abstract: Traffic Intersections are vital to urban road networks as they regulate the
movement of people and goods. However, they are regions of conflicting
trajectories and are prone to accidents. Deep Generative models of traffic
dynamics at signalized intersections can greatly help traffic authorities
better understand the efficiency and safety aspects. At present, models are
evaluated on computational metrics that primarily look at trajectory
reconstruction errors. They are not evaluated online in a `live'
microsimulation scenario. Further, these metrics do not adequately consider
traffic engineering-specific concerns such as red-light violations, unallowed
stoppage, etc. In this work, we provide a comprehensive analytics tool to
train, run, and evaluate models with metrics that give better insights into
model performance from a traffic engineering point of view. We train a
state-of-the-art multi-vehicle trajectory forecasting model on a large dataset
collected by running a calibrated scenario of a real-world urban intersection.
We then evaluate the performance of the prediction models, online in a
microsimulator, under unseen traffic conditions. We show that despite using
ideally-behaved trajectories as input, and achieving low trajectory
reconstruction errors, the generated trajectories show behaviors that break
traffic rules. We introduce new metrics to evaluate such undesired behaviors
and present our results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统知识图谱仅能表示二元事实，而NKG能捕捉更复杂的n元事实，链接预测对完善NKG和提升下游应用性能至关重要。

Method: 通过系统分类和分析现有NKG链接预测方法，总结其技术特点和应用场景。

Result: 综述了NKG链接预测的现状，揭示了现有方法的优缺点，并探讨了其在不同场景中的应用效果。

Conclusion: NKG链接预测是一个新兴且重要的研究方向，未来需进一步探索更高效的方法和更广泛的应用场景。

Abstract: N-ary Knowledge Graphs (NKGs) are a specialized type of knowledge graph
designed to efficiently represent complex real-world facts. Unlike traditional
knowledge graphs, where a fact typically involves two entities, NKGs can
capture n-ary facts containing more than two entities. Link prediction in NKGs
aims to predict missing elements within these n-ary facts, which is essential
for completing NKGs and improving the performance of downstream applications.
This task has recently gained significant attention. In this paper, we present
the first comprehensive survey of link prediction in NKGs, providing an
overview of the field, systematically categorizing existing methods, and
analyzing their performance and application scenarios. We also outline
promising directions for future research.

*Polina Kirichenko,Mark Ibrahim,Kamalika Chaudhuri,Samuel J. Bell*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AbstentionBench是一个用于评估大型语言模型（LLM）在不确定情况下拒绝回答能力的基准测试，涵盖20个多样化数据集。研究发现，模型扩展对提升拒绝回答能力帮助有限，而推理微调反而会降低该能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了确保LLM在现实场景中可靠部署，需要研究其在面对不确定、模糊或无法回答的问题时拒绝回答的能力。目前缺乏系统性的评估框架。

Method: 引入AbstentionBench，一个大规模基准测试，涵盖20个数据集，评估LLM在面对未知答案、模糊问题、错误前提等情况时的拒绝回答能力。

Result: 评估20个前沿LLM发现，拒绝回答能力仍是一个未解决的问题，模型扩展对其帮助有限。推理微调平均降低拒绝回答能力24%。精心设计的系统提示可提升拒绝回答能力，但无法解决根本问题。

Conclusion: AbstentionBench的发布旨在推动LLM可靠性研究，揭示当前模型在不确定性推理上的不足。

Abstract: For Large Language Models (LLMs) to be reliably deployed in both everyday and
high-stakes domains, knowing when not to answer is equally critical as
answering correctly. Real-world user queries, which can be underspecified,
ill-posed, or fundamentally unanswerable, require LLMs to reason about
uncertainty and selectively abstain -- i.e., refuse to answer definitively.
However, abstention remains understudied, without a systematic evaluation
framework for modern LLMs. In this work, we introduce AbstentionBench, a
large-scale benchmark for holistically evaluating abstention across 20 diverse
datasets, including questions with unknown answers, underspecification, false
premises, subjective interpretations, and outdated information. Evaluating 20
frontier LLMs reveals abstention is an unsolved problem, and one where scaling
models is of little use. While recent reasoning LLMs have shown impressive
results in complex problem solving, surprisingly, we find that reasoning
fine-tuning degrades abstention (by $24\%$ on average), even for math and
science domains on which reasoning models are explicitly trained. We find that
while a carefully crafted system prompt can boost abstention in practice, it
does not resolve models' fundamental inability to reason about uncertainty. We
release AbstentionBench to foster research into advancing LLM reliability.

TL;DR: VIKI-Bench是首个针对具身多智能体协作的分层基准，包含三个结构化层次：智能体激活、任务规划和轨迹感知。VIKI-R框架通过微调预训练的视觉语言模型（VLM）并结合强化学习，显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 协调动态环境中的多智能体是AI核心挑战，现有视觉语言模型（VLMs）在支持多样化具身类型方面有限。

Method: 提出VIKI-Bench基准和VIKI-R框架，后者通过两阶段方法（微调VLM和强化学习）实现多智能体协作。

Result: VIKI-R在所有任务层次上显著优于基线方法，并展现出异构智能体的组合协作模式。

Conclusion: VIKI-Bench和VIKI-R为具身AI系统中的多智能体视觉驱动协作提供了统一测试平台和方法。

Abstract: Coordinating multiple embodied agents in dynamic environments remains a core
challenge in artificial intelligence, requiring both perception-driven
reasoning and scalable cooperation strategies. While recent works have
leveraged large language models (LLMs) for multi-agent planning, a few have
begun to explore vision-language models (VLMs) for visual reasoning. However,
these VLM-based approaches remain limited in their support for diverse
embodiment types. In this work, we introduce VIKI-Bench, the first hierarchical
benchmark tailored for embodied multi-agent cooperation, featuring three
structured levels: agent activation, task planning, and trajectory perception.
VIKI-Bench includes diverse robot embodiments, multi-view visual observations,
and structured supervision signals to evaluate reasoning grounded in visual
inputs. To demonstrate the utility of VIKI-Bench, we propose VIKI-R, a
two-stage framework that fine-tunes a pretrained vision-language model (VLM)
using Chain-of-Thought annotated demonstrations, followed by reinforcement
learning under multi-level reward signals. Our extensive experiments show that
VIKI-R significantly outperforms baselines method across all task levels.
Furthermore, we show that reinforcement learning enables the emergence of
compositional cooperation patterns among heterogeneous agents. Together,
VIKI-Bench and VIKI-R offer a unified testbed and method for advancing
multi-agent, visual-driven cooperation in embodied AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估AI系统在算法工程中的表现，特别是在解决复杂优化问题（如物流调度、生产计划等）时的能力。

Method: 基于AtCoder Heuristic Contests的真实任务，设计了ALE-Bench，支持长时间迭代优化和交互式代理架构。

Result: 前沿LLMs在特定问题上表现优异，但在问题一致性和长期问题解决能力上仍落后于人类。

Conclusion: ALE-Bench有助于推动AI在复杂优化问题上的未来发展。

Abstract: How well do AI systems perform in algorithm engineering for hard optimization
problems in domains such as package-delivery routing, crew scheduling, factory
production planning, and power-grid balancing? We introduce ALE-Bench, a new
benchmark for evaluating AI systems on score-based algorithmic programming
contests. Drawing on real tasks from the AtCoder Heuristic Contests, ALE-Bench
presents optimization problems that are computationally hard and admit no known
exact solution. Unlike short-duration, pass/fail coding benchmarks, ALE-Bench
encourages iterative solution refinement over long time horizons. Our software
framework supports interactive agent architectures that leverage test-run
feedback and visualizations. Our evaluation of frontier LLMs revealed that
while they demonstrate high performance on specific problems, a notable gap
remains compared to humans in terms of consistency across problems and
long-horizon problem-solving capabilities. This highlights the need for this
benchmark to foster future AI advancements.

### [35] [Conservative Bias in Large Language Models: Measuring Relation Predictions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08120)
*Toyin Aguda,Erik Wilson,Allan Anzagira,Simerjot Kaur,Charese Smiley*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大语言模型（LLMs）在关系抽取任务中表现出明显的保守偏见，倾向于选择No_Relation标签，导致信息丢失。研究发现保守偏见比幻觉更常见，并通过SBERT和LLM提示量化了其影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在关系抽取任务中的保守偏见行为及其对信息丢失的影响。

Method: 通过多提示、数据集和关系类型的系统评估，引入Hobson's choice概念，并使用SBERT和LLM提示量化保守偏见。

Result: 保守偏见的发生频率是幻觉的两倍，且保守行为在约束提示与半约束/开放式提示生成的标签间语义相似性显著。

Conclusion: 保守偏见虽避免错误关系分配，但导致信息丢失，需在模型设计中平衡保守与信息量。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit pronounced conservative bias in relation
extraction tasks, frequently defaulting to No_Relation label when an
appropriate option is unavailable. While this behavior helps prevent incorrect
relation assignments, our analysis reveals that it also leads to significant
information loss when reasoning is not explicitly included in the output. We
systematically evaluate this trade-off across multiple prompts, datasets, and
relation types, introducing the concept of Hobson's choice to capture scenarios
where models opt for safe but uninformative labels over hallucinated ones. Our
findings suggest that conservative bias occurs twice as often as hallucination.
To quantify this effect, we use SBERT and LLM prompts to capture the semantic
similarity between conservative bias behaviors in constrained prompts and
labels generated from semi-constrained and open-ended prompts.

TL;DR: QA-LIGN是一种自动符号奖励分解方法，通过为每个原则生成独立的奖励组件，提升语言模型对齐的透明度和适应性，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统奖励对齐方法将多样反馈压缩为单一标量奖励，导致目标不透明且难以解释，限制了语言模型对齐的可控性。

Method: QA-LIGN通过设计原则特定的评估问题，分解奖励为独立组件，替代传统黑盒奖励模型。

Result: 实验表明，QA-LIGN在透明度和适应性上优于传统方法，性能与DPO基线相当或更好。

Conclusion: QA-LIGN为语言模型对齐提供了更可解释和可控的解决方案，且不影响任务性能。

Abstract: Alignment of large language models with explicit principles (such as
helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness) is crucial for ensuring safe and
reliable AI systems. However, standard reward-based alignment methods typically
collapse diverse feedback into a single scalar reward, entangling multiple
objectives into one opaque training signal, which hinders interpretability. In
this work, we introduce QA-LIGN, an automatic symbolic reward decomposition
approach that preserves the structure of each constitutional principle within
the reward mechanism. Instead of training a black-box reward model that outputs
a monolithic score, QA-LIGN formulates principle-specific evaluation questions
and derives separate reward components for each principle, making it a drop-in
reward model replacement. Experiments aligning an uncensored large language
model with a set of constitutional principles demonstrate that QA-LIGN offers
greater transparency and adaptability in the alignment process. At the same
time, our approach achieves performance on par with or better than a DPO
baseline. Overall, these results represent a step toward more interpretable and
controllable alignment of language models, achieved without sacrificing
end-task performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试缺乏对权威数据源和多模态经济任务的关注，EconWebArena旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过大型语言模型生成候选任务，并经过人工筛选以确保清晰性、可行性和数据可靠性。评估多模态LLM作为网络代理的表现，分析失败案例和关键因素。

Result: 结果显示性能差距显著，尤其在数据基础、导航和多模态理解方面存在挑战。

Conclusion: EconWebArena为经济网络智能提供了一个严格的测试平台。

Abstract: We introduce EconWebArena, a benchmark for evaluating autonomous agents on
complex, multimodal economic tasks in realistic web environments. The benchmark
comprises 360 curated tasks from 82 authoritative websites spanning domains
such as macroeconomics, labor, finance, trade, and public policy. Each task
challenges agents to navigate live websites, interpret structured and visual
content, interact with real interfaces, and extract precise, time-sensitive
data through multi-step workflows. We construct the benchmark by prompting
multiple large language models (LLMs) to generate candidate tasks, followed by
rigorous human curation to ensure clarity, feasibility, and source reliability.
Unlike prior work, EconWebArena emphasizes fidelity to authoritative data
sources and the need for grounded web-based economic reasoning. We evaluate a
diverse set of state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs as web agents, analyze failure
cases, and conduct ablation studies to assess the impact of visual grounding,
plan-based reasoning, and interaction design. Our results reveal substantial
performance gaps and highlight persistent challenges in grounding, navigation,
and multimodal understanding, positioning EconWebArena as a rigorous testbed
for economic web intelligence.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于注意力层和多语言数据集的多语言仇恨言论检测方法，显著提升了英语、西班牙语和乌尔都语的检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上的仇恨言论威胁在线安全和包容性，但乌尔都语等语言的仇恨言论检测研究不足，尤其是基于翻译的方法。

Method: 构建了一个包含英语、乌尔都语和西班牙语的三语数据集，结合注意力层和Transformer模型（如GPT-3.5 Turbo和Qwen 2.5 72B）进行特征提取和检测。

Result: 模型在英语、西班牙语和乌尔都语上的宏F1分数分别为0.87、0.85和0.81，多语言联合模型达到0.88，相比基线SVM模型提升了5.19%至8.97%。

Conclusion: 该框架为多语言仇恨言论检测提供了高效解决方案，有助于构建更安全的数字社区。

Abstract: Social media platforms are critical spaces for public discourse, shaping
opinions and community dynamics, yet their widespread use has amplified harmful
content, particularly hate speech, threatening online safety and inclusivity.
While hate speech detection has been extensively studied in languages like
English and Spanish, Urdu remains underexplored, especially using
translation-based approaches. To address this gap, we introduce a trilingual
dataset of 10,193 tweets in English (3,834 samples), Urdu (3,197 samples), and
Spanish (3,162 samples), collected via keyword filtering, with a balanced
distribution of 4,849 Hateful and 5,344 Not-Hateful labels. Our methodology
leverages attention layers as a precursor to transformer-based models and large
language models (LLMs), enhancing feature extraction for multilingual hate
speech detection. For non-transformer models, we use TF-IDF for feature
extraction. The dataset is benchmarked using state-of-the-art models, including
GPT-3.5 Turbo and Qwen 2.5 72B, alongside traditional machine learning models
like SVM and other transformers (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa). Three annotators,
following rigorous guidelines, ensured high dataset quality, achieving a
Fleiss' Kappa of 0.821. Our approach, integrating attention layers with GPT-3.5
Turbo and Qwen 2.5 72B, achieves strong performance, with macro F1 scores of
0.87 for English (GPT-3.5 Turbo), 0.85 for Spanish (GPT-3.5 Turbo), 0.81 for
Urdu (Qwen 2.5 72B), and 0.88 for the joint multilingual model (Qwen 2.5 72B).
These results reflect improvements of 8.75% in English (over SVM baseline
0.80), 8.97% in Spanish (over SVM baseline 0.78), 5.19% in Urdu (over SVM
baseline 0.77), and 7.32% in the joint multilingual model (over SVM baseline
0.82). Our framework offers a robust solution for multilingual hate speech
detection, fostering safer digital communities worldwide.

TL;DR: ETT-CKGE提出了一种高效、任务驱动的持续知识图谱嵌入方法，通过可学习的任务相关令牌简化知识转移，显著提升训练效率和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有持续知识图谱嵌入方法在效率和可扩展性上存在不足，主要由于手动设计的节点/关系重要性评分和计算复杂度高的图遍历。

Method: ETT-CKGE引入可学习的任务驱动令牌，直接捕获任务相关信号，避免显式节点评分或遍历，通过简单的矩阵操作实现知识转移。

Result: 在六个基准数据集上的实验表明，ETT-CKGE在预测性能上优于或与现有方法相当，同时显著提升训练效率和可扩展性。

Conclusion: ETT-CKGE通过任务驱动令牌实现了高效且有效的持续知识图谱嵌入，为相关领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Continual Knowledge Graph Embedding (CKGE) seeks to integrate new knowledge
while preserving past information. However, existing methods struggle with
efficiency and scalability due to two key limitations: (1) suboptimal knowledge
preservation between snapshots caused by manually designed node/relation
importance scores that ignore graph dependencies relevant to the downstream
task, and (2) computationally expensive graph traversal for node/relation
importance calculation, leading to slow training and high memory overhead. To
address these limitations, we introduce ETT-CKGE (Efficient, Task-driven,
Tokens for Continual Knowledge Graph Embedding), a novel task-guided CKGE
method that leverages efficient task-driven tokens for efficient and effective
knowledge transfer between snapshots. Our method introduces a set of learnable
tokens that directly capture task-relevant signals, eliminating the need for
explicit node scoring or traversal. These tokens serve as consistent and
reusable guidance across snapshots, enabling efficient token-masked embedding
alignment between snapshots. Importantly, knowledge transfer is achieved
through simple matrix operations, significantly reducing training time and
memory usage. Extensive experiments across six benchmark datasets demonstrate
that ETT-CKGE consistently achieves superior or competitive predictive
performance, while substantially improving training efficiency and scalability
compared to state-of-the-art CKGE methods. The code is available at:

Motivation: 尽管AI能生成叙事连贯的短篇小说，但其文学价值的严格评估（尤其是美学质量）缺乏关注。

Method: 提出GrAImes协议，结合文学理论，为AI生成的微小说提供客观评估框架，并通过文学专家和爱好者验证。

Result: 验证结果显示GrAImes协议能有效评估AI生成微小说的文学价值。

Conclusion: GrAImes协议为自动生成微小说的文学价值评估奠定了基础。

Abstract: Automated story writing has been a subject of study for over 60 years. Large
language models can generate narratively consistent and linguistically coherent
short fiction texts. Despite these advancements, rigorous assessment of such
outputs for literary merit - especially concerning aesthetic qualities - has
received scant attention. In this paper, we address the challenge of evaluating
AI-generated microfictions and argue that this task requires consideration of
literary criteria across various aspects of the text, such as thematic
coherence, textual clarity, interpretive depth, and aesthetic quality. To
facilitate this, we present GrAImes: an evaluation protocol grounded in
literary theory, specifically drawing from a literary perspective, to offer an
objective framework for assessing AI-generated microfiction. Furthermore, we
report the results of our validation of the evaluation protocol, as answered by
both literature experts and literary enthusiasts. This protocol will serve as a
foundation for evaluating automatically generated microfictions and assessing
their literary value.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统专家驱动的标准化方法在快速发展的领域（如AI和量子计算）中难以应对英语技术术语的快速增长，手动方法难以保证多语言一致性。

Method: 提出LLM-BT框架，包括术语级一致性验证、多路径验证工作流和将回译视为动态语义嵌入。

Result: 实验显示术语一致性超过90%，跨语言鲁棒性强（BLEU>0.45，葡萄牙语准确率100%）。

Conclusion: LLM-BT将回译转化为多语言术语标准化的主动引擎，支持人机协作，为全球科技领域的术语治理提供基础设施。

Abstract: The rapid growth of English technical terms challenges traditional
expert-driven standardization, especially in fast-evolving fields like AI and
quantum computing. Manual methods struggle to ensure multilingual consistency.
We propose \textbf{LLM-BT}, a back-translation framework powered by large
language models (LLMs) to automate terminology verification and standardization
via cross-lingual semantic alignment. Our contributions are: \textbf{(1)
Term-Level Consistency Validation:} Using English $\rightarrow$ intermediate
language $\rightarrow$ English back-translation, LLM-BT achieves high term
consistency across models (e.g., GPT-4, DeepSeek, Grok), with case studies
showing over 90\% exact or semantic matches. \textbf{(2) Multi-Path
Verification Workflow:} A novel ``Retrieve--Generate--Verify--Optimize''
pipeline integrates serial (e.g., EN $\rightarrow$ ZHcn $\rightarrow$ ZHtw
$\rightarrow$ EN) and parallel (e.g., EN $\rightarrow$ Chinese/Portuguese
$\rightarrow$ EN) BT routes. BLEU and term accuracy indicate strong
cross-lingual robustness (BLEU $>$ 0.45; Portuguese accuracy 100\%).
\textbf{(3) Back-Translation as Semantic Embedding:} BT is conceptualized as
dynamic semantic embedding, revealing latent meaning trajectories. Unlike
static embeddings, LLM-BT provides transparent path-based embeddings shaped by
model evolution. LLM-BT transforms back-translation into an active engine for
multilingual terminology standardization, enabling human--AI collaboration:
machines ensure semantic fidelity, humans guide cultural interpretation. This
infrastructure supports terminology governance across scientific and
technological fields worldwide.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLM）中信息检索与生成能力的关联，发现上下文干扰会显著降低检索准确性，提示存在工作记忆瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM在信息检索中如何受到上下文干扰的影响，尤其是主动干扰（PI）对检索能力的限制。

Method: 采用认知科学中的主动干扰范式（PI），设计PI-LLM评估，通过流式更新语义相关的键值对并查询最终值，观察干扰积累对检索的影响。

Result: 随着干扰积累，LLM检索准确性呈对数线性下降至零，错误主要源于检索被覆盖的旧值。提示工程缓解效果有限。

Conclusion: LLM在干扰分离和信息灵活处理方面存在根本性限制，需开发新方法以增强模型在检索时抑制无关内容的能力。

Abstract: Information retrieval in Large Language Models (LLMs) is increasingly
recognized as intertwined with generation capabilities rather than mere lookup.
While longer contexts are often assumed to improve retrieval, the effects of
intra-context interference remain understudied. To address this, we adapt the
proactive interference (PI) paradigm from cognitive science, where earlier
information disrupts recall of newer updates. In humans, susceptibility to such
interference is inversely linked to working memory capacity. We introduce
PI-LLM, an evaluation that sequentially streams semantically related key-value
updates and queries only the final values. Although these final values are
clearly positioned just before the query, LLM retrieval accuracy declines
log-linearly toward zero as interference accumulates; errors arise from
retrieving previously overwritten values. Attempts to mitigate interference via
prompt engineering (e.g., instructing models to ignore earlier input) yield
limited success. These findings reveal a fundamental constraint on LLMs'
ability to disentangle interference and flexibly manipulate information,
suggesting a working memory bottleneck beyond mere context access. This calls
for approaches that strengthen models' ability to suppress irrelevant content
during retrieval.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了利用写作过程数据（如键盘记录和定期快照）改进大型语言模型（LLM）反馈的效果，发现学生更倾向于基于过程的反馈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM的反馈仅基于最终文本，缺乏写作过程的上下文，无法反映学生的思考和修订过程。

Method: 开发了一个数字写作工具，记录学生的打字内容和文章演变过程，并通过LLM生成基于最终文本和写作过程的反馈。20名学生使用该工具完成限时写作，并通过调查评估反馈效果。

Result: 学生更偏好基于过程的LLM反馈，认为其更符合自身思维。某些编辑行为（如添加内容或重组段落）与更高的连贯性和详述得分相关。

Conclusion: 让LLM更了解写作过程可以生成更有意义、个性化和支持性的反馈。

Abstract: Large language models(LLMs) like Gemini are becoming common tools for
supporting student writing. But most of their feedback is based only on the
final essay missing important context about how that text was written. In this
paper, we explore whether using writing process data, collected through
keystroke logging and periodic snapshots, can help LLMs give feedback that
better reflects how learners think and revise while writing. We built a digital
writing tool that captures both what students type and how their essays evolve
over time. Twenty students used this tool to write timed essays, which were
then evaluated in two ways: (i) LLM generated feedback using both the final
essay and the full writing trace, and (ii) After the task, students completed
surveys about how useful and relatable they found the feedback. Early results
show that learners preferred the process-aware LLM feedback, finding it more in
tune with their own thinking. We also found that certain types of edits, like
adding new content or reorganizing paragraphs, aligned closely with higher
scores in areas like coherence and elaboration. Our findings suggest that
making LLMs more aware of the writing process can lead to feedback that feels
more meaningful, personal, and supportive.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) and AI systems have led
to a paradigm shift in the design and optimization of complex AI workflows. By
integrating multiple components, compound AI systems have become increasingly
adept at performing sophisticated tasks. However, as these systems grow in
complexity, new challenges arise in optimizing not only individual components
but also their interactions. While traditional optimization methods such as
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) remain
foundational, the rise of natural language feedback introduces promising new
approaches, especially for optimizing non-differentiable systems. This paper
provides a systematic review of recent progress in optimizing compound AI
systems, encompassing both numerical and language-based techniques. We
formalize the notion of compound AI system optimization, classify existing
methods along several key dimensions, and highlight open research challenges
and future directions in this rapidly evolving field. A list of surveyed papers

TL;DR: CLAIM-BENCH是一个用于评估大语言模型（LLMs）在科学论文中提取和验证主张与证据能力的基准测试，揭示了LLMs在复杂科学内容处理上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索LLMs是否能够真正理解和处理复杂研究论文中的主张与证据关系，填补了该领域的研究空白。

Method: 研究通过系统比较三种启发于分治策略的方法，在六种不同的LLMs上进行评估，设计了多轮和逐一提示策略。

Result: 结果显示闭源模型（如GPT-4和Claude）在准确率和召回率上优于开源模型，但处理复杂科学内容仍存在显著限制。

Conclusion: CLAIM-BENCH为评估LLMs的科学理解能力设定了新标准，并为构建更可靠的推理系统提供了路径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used for complex research
tasks such as literature review, idea generation, and scientific paper
analysis, yet their ability to truly understand and process the intricate
relationships within complex research papers, such as the logical links between
claims and supporting evidence remains largely unexplored. In this study, we
present CLAIM-BENCH, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLMs'
capabilities in scientific claim-evidence extraction and validation, a task
that reflects deeper comprehension of scientific argumentation. We
systematically compare three approaches which are inspired by divide and
conquer approaches, across six diverse LLMs, highlighting model-specific
strengths and weaknesses in scientific comprehension. Through evaluation
involving over 300 claim-evidence pairs across multiple research domains, we
reveal significant limitations in LLMs' ability to process complex scientific
content. Our results demonstrate that closed-source models like GPT-4 and
Claude consistently outperform open-source counterparts in precision and recall
across claim-evidence identification tasks. Furthermore, strategically designed
three-pass and one-by-one prompting approaches significantly improve LLMs'
abilities to accurately link dispersed evidence with claims, although this
comes at increased computational cost. CLAIM-BENCH sets a new standard for
evaluating scientific comprehension in LLMs, offering both a diagnostic tool
and a path forward for building systems capable of deeper, more reliable
reasoning across full-length papers.

*Wanjing Anya Ma,Michael Flor,Zuowei Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了阅读理解中的推理能力，提出了推理类型的分类法，并利用GPT-4o生成诊断性问题，结合人类判断实现高质量评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升阅读理解教学中推理能力的诊断效果，为教育者提供更有针对性的干预措施。

Method: 提出推理类型分类法，分析诊断题库分布；使用GPT-4o通过少量示例生成推理问题，比较有无思维链提示的效果。

Result: GPT-4o生成的问题93.8%质量合格，但仅42.6%准确匹配目标推理类型；人工与自动结合效果显著。

Conclusion: 自动生成与人工判断结合是扩展高质量诊断评估的有效途径。

Abstract: Inference making is an essential but complex skill in reading comprehension
(RC). Some inferences require resolving references across sentences, and some
rely on using prior knowledge to fill in the detail that is not explicitly
written in the text. Diagnostic RC questions can help educators provide more
effective and targeted reading instruction and interventions for school-age
students. We introduce a taxonomy of inference types for RC and use it to
analyze the distribution of items within a diagnostic RC item bank. Next, we
present experiments using GPT-4o to generate bridging-inference RC items for
given reading passages via few-shot prompting, comparing conditions with and
without chain-of-thought prompts. Generated items were evaluated on three
aspects: overall item quality, appropriate inference type, and LLM reasoning,
achieving high inter-rater agreements above 0.90. Our results show that GPT-4o
produced 93.8% good-quality questions suitable for operational use in grade
3-12 contexts; however, only 42.6% of the generated questions accurately
matched the targeted inference type. We conclude that combining automatic item
generation with human judgment offers a promising path toward scalable,
high-quality diagnostic RC assessments.

TL;DR: 这篇技术报告介绍了Institutional Books 1.0，一个基于哈佛图书馆公共领域书籍的大规模数据集，旨在为大型语言模型（LLMs）提供高质量的训练数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于高质量公开训练数据的稀缺性，以及LLMs对数据质量的高度依赖，需要可持续的数据管理实践和清晰的数据来源链。

Method: 通过与哈佛图书馆合作，从Google Books项目中提取、分析和处理公共领域的书籍，生成一个包含OCR文本和元数据的详细数据集。

Result: 数据集包含983,004卷公共领域书籍，总计242B tokens，涵盖多种语言，并提供了原始和处理后的文本及元数据。

Conclusion: 该项目的目标是提高历史文献的可访问性，使其更易于人类和机器过滤、阅读和使用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) use data to learn about the world in order to
produce meaningful correlations and predictions. As such, the nature, scale,
quality, and diversity of the datasets used to train these models, or to
support their work at inference time, have a direct impact on their quality.
The rapid development and adoption of LLMs of varying quality has brought into
focus the scarcity of publicly available, high-quality training data and
revealed an urgent need to ground the stewardship of these datasets in
sustainable practices with clear provenance chains. To that end, this technical
report introduces Institutional Books 1.0, a large collection of public domain
books originally digitized through Harvard Library's participation in the
Google Books project, beginning in 2006. Working with Harvard Library, we
extracted, analyzed, and processed these volumes into an extensively-documented
dataset of historic texts. This analysis covers the entirety of Harvard
Library's collection scanned as part of that project, originally spanning
1,075,899 volumes written in over 250 different languages for a total of
approximately 250 billion tokens. As part of this initial release, the
OCR-extracted text (original and post-processed) as well as the metadata
(bibliographic, source, and generated) of the 983,004 volumes, or 242B tokens,
identified as being in the public domain have been made available. This report
describes this project's goals and methods as well as the results of the
analyses we performed, all in service of making this historical collection more
accessible and easier for humans and machines alike to filter, read and use.

TL;DR: NoWait通过禁用显式自我反思标记（如“Wait”和“Hmm”），显著减少了推理过程中的冗余输出，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在复杂推理中常因过度思考产生冗余输出，影响效率。研究探讨显式自我反思是否必要。

Method: 提出NoWait方法，在推理过程中抑制显式自我反思标记。

Result: 在10个基准测试中，NoWait将推理轨迹长度减少27%-51%，且不损害模型性能。

Conclusion: NoWait为高效且性能不变的多模态推理提供了即插即用的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models have enabled complex, step-by-step
reasoning but often introduce significant overthinking, resulting in verbose
and redundant outputs that hinder efficiency. In this study, we examine whether
explicit self-reflection, signaled by tokens such as "Wait" and "Hmm", is
necessary for advanced reasoning. We propose NoWait, a simple yet effective
approach that disables explicit self-reflection by suppressing these tokens
during inference. Extensive experiments on ten benchmarks across textual,
visual, and video reasoning tasks show that NoWait reduces chain-of-thought
trajectory length by up to 27%-51% in five R1-style model series, without
compromising model utility. NoWait thus offers a plug-and-play solution for
efficient and utility-preserving multimodal reasoning.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Bloom分类法的多认知层次评估框架，用于评估大语言模型（LLMs）在医学领域的表现，发现模型性能随认知复杂度增加而显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在不同认知层次上的能力，尤其是医学领域，以填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 提出多认知层次评估框架，整合医学数据集并设计针对三个认知层次的任务，评估六种主流LLMs家族的表现。

Result: 模型性能随认知复杂度增加而下降，模型规模对高认知层次任务的影响更大。

Conclusion: 研究强调了提升LLMs在高认知层次医学能力的必要性，为开发适用于实际医学应用的LLMs提供了见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on
various medical benchmarks, but their capabilities across different cognitive
levels remain underexplored. Inspired by Bloom's Taxonomy, we propose a
multi-cognitive-level evaluation framework for assessing LLMs in the medical
domain in this study. The framework integrates existing medical datasets and
introduces tasks targeting three cognitive levels: preliminary knowledge grasp,
comprehensive knowledge application, and scenario-based problem solving. Using
this framework, we systematically evaluate state-of-the-art general and medical
LLMs from six prominent families: Llama, Qwen, Gemma, Phi, GPT, and DeepSeek.
Our findings reveal a significant performance decline as cognitive complexity
increases across evaluated models, with model size playing a more critical role
in performance at higher cognitive levels. Our study highlights the need to
enhance LLMs' medical capabilities at higher cognitive levels and provides
insights for developing LLMs suited to real-world medical applications.

*Yiqun Sun,Qiang Huang,Anthony K. H. Tung,Jun Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文主张文本嵌入研究应超越表层意义，将隐含语义作为核心建模目标，并提出改进方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本嵌入模型主要关注表层语义，忽视了语言中的隐含意义（如语用、说话者意图和社会文化背景），导致其在需要深层理解的任务上表现不佳。

Method: 提出通过使用更多样化和语言学基础的数据、设计评估深层语义理解的基准，以及明确将隐含意义作为建模目标来改进模型。

Result: 初步研究表明，即使是先进模型在隐含语义任务上的表现也仅略优于简单基线。

Conclusion: 呼吁研究社区进行范式转变，以更好地应对现实语言的复杂性。

Abstract: This position paper argues that the text embedding research community should
move beyond surface meaning and embrace implicit semantics as a central
modeling goal. Text embedding models have become foundational in modern NLP,
powering a wide range of applications and drawing increasing research
attention. Yet, much of this progress remains narrowly focused on surface-level
semantics. In contrast, linguistic theory emphasizes that meaning is often
implicit, shaped by pragmatics, speaker intent, and sociocultural context.
Current embedding models are typically trained on data that lacks such depth
and evaluated on benchmarks that reward the capture of surface meaning. As a
result, they struggle with tasks requiring interpretive reasoning, speaker
stance, or social meaning. Our pilot study highlights this gap, showing that
even state-of-the-art models perform only marginally better than simplistic
baselines on implicit semantics tasks. To address this, we call for a paradigm
shift: embedding research should prioritize more diverse and linguistically
grounded training data, design benchmarks that evaluate deeper semantic
understanding, and explicitly frame implicit meaning as a core modeling
objective, better aligning embeddings with real-world language complexity.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于因果归因的框架，用于识别Transformer中与行为相关的注意力头，通过VQ-AE量化行为相关和不相关子空间，提升推理时干预的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖表面线索或临时启发式方法，导致模块选择不理想或产生意外结果，需一种更原则性的方法。

Method: 训练VQ-AE量化注意力头的激活，划分行为相关和不相关子空间，通过二元分类指标评估行为相关性。

Result: 在七个LLM和五个行为数据集上验证，方法在真实性干预任务中表现优异，且所选头在跨域场景中具有零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: 提出的框架能更准确地识别行为相关注意力头，提升推理时干预效果，并具有泛化性。

Abstract: Inference-time steering aims to alter the response characteristics of large
language models (LLMs) without modifying their underlying parameters. A
critical step in this process is the identification of internal modules within
LLMs that are associated with the target behavior. However, current approaches
to module selection often depend on superficial cues or ad-hoc heuristics,
which can result in suboptimal or unintended outcomes. In this work, we propose
a principled causal-attribution framework for identifying behavior-relevant
attention heads in transformers. For each head, we train a vector-quantized
autoencoder (VQ-AE) on its attention activations, partitioning the latent space
into behavior-relevant and behavior-irrelevant subspaces, each quantized with a
shared learnable codebook. We assess the behavioral relevance of each head by
quantifying the separability of VQ-AE encodings for behavior-aligned versus
behavior-violating responses using a binary classification metric. This yields
a behavioral relevance score that reflects each head discriminative capacity
with respect to the target behavior, guiding both selection and importance
weighting. Experiments on seven LLMs from two model families and five
behavioral steering datasets demonstrate that our method enables more accurate
inference-time interventions, achieving superior performance on the
truthfulness-steering task. Furthermore, the heads selected by our approach
exhibit strong zero-shot generalization in cross-domain truthfulness-steering
scenarios.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CC-RAG的新方法，通过结合零样本三元组提取和主题感知图链，改进了RAG管道，以更好地建模因果关系。实验表明，CC-RAG在专业领域中优于标准RAG和零样本LLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在理解因果关系方面存在挑战，尤其是在需要深层推理的专业领域。标准RAG管道缺乏对因果依赖的结构化建模能力。

Method: CC-RAG方法整合了零样本三元组提取和主题感知图链，构建有向无环图（DAG），并通过前向/后向链式推理生成结构化答案。

Result: 在比特币价格波动和高雪氏病两个领域的实验中，CC-RAG在链相似性、信息密度和词汇多样性上表现优于标准RAG和零样本LLM。

Conclusion: CC-RAG通过显式建模因果结构，使LLM在专业领域中生成更准确和可解释的响应，填补了平面检索的不足。

Abstract: Understanding cause and effect relationships remains a formidable challenge
for Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in specialized domains where
reasoning requires more than surface-level correlations. Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) improves factual accuracy, but standard RAG pipelines treat
evidence as flat context, lacking the structure required to model true causal
dependencies. We introduce Causal-Chain RAG (CC-RAG), a novel approach that
integrates zero-shot triple extraction and theme-aware graph chaining into the
RAG pipeline, enabling structured multi-hop inference. Given a domain specific
corpus, CC-RAG constructs a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of <cause, relation,
effect> triples and uses forward/backward chaining to guide structured answer
generation. Experiments on two real-world domains: Bitcoin price fluctuations
and Gaucher disease, show that CC-RAG outperforms standard RAG and zero-shot
LLMs in chain similarity, information density, and lexical diversity. Both
LLM-as-a-Judge and human evaluations consistently favor CC-RAG. Our results
demonstrate that explicitly modeling causal structure enables LLMs to generate
more accurate and interpretable responses, especially in specialized domains
where flat retrieval fails.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无需训练的位置对比解码方法（PCD），通过对比长文本和局部注意力生成的logits，有效缓解了大型语言模型在长上下文中的性能退化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在长上下文窗口中存在性能退化问题，现有解决方案训练成本过高，统计行为和成本效益方法尚未充分探索。

Method: 从解码角度识别了后验显著性衰减（PSA）现象，并提出PCD方法，通过对比长文本和局部注意力的logits，使模型专注于大规模短到长训练带来的增益。

Result: 实验结果表明，PCD在长上下文基准测试中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: PCD是一种无需训练的有效方法，能够显著缓解长上下文中的注意力分数退化问题。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) support long contexts, they struggle with
performance degradation within the context window. Current solutions incur
prohibitive training costs, leaving statistical behaviors and cost-effective
approaches underexplored. From the decoding perspective, we identify the
Posterior Salience Attenuation (PSA) phenomenon, where the salience ratio
correlates with long-text performance degradation. Notably, despite the
attenuation, gold tokens still occupy high-ranking positions in the decoding
space. Motivated by it, we propose the training-free Positional Contrastive
Decoding (PCD) that contrasts the logits derived from long-aware attention with
those from designed local-aware attention, enabling the model to focus on the
gains introduced by large-scale short-to-long training. Through the analysis of
long-term decay simulation, we demonstrate that PCD effectively alleviates
attention score degradation. Experimental results show that PCD achieves
state-of-the-art performance on long-context benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用小型草稿模型优化长上下文LLM推理的新框架，包括SpecKV和SpecPC两种方法，显著提升了准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于Transformer的二次计算和线性内存复杂度，优化长上下文LLM推理至关重要。现有方法依赖粗略的预测，缺乏准确性。

Method: 引入SpecKV（基于草稿输出评估KV对重要性）和SpecPC（利用草稿模型注意力激活识别不重要提示词）两种方法。

Result: 实验表明，新方法在长上下文基准测试中准确性更高，同时保持了内存、延迟和吞吐量的改进。

Conclusion: 草稿模型首次用于近似LLM推理加速，扩展了其应用范围，效果优于现有基线。

Abstract: Optimizing inference for long-context Large Language Models (LLMs) is
increasingly important due to the quadratic compute and linear memory
complexity of Transformers. Existing approximation methods, such as key-value
(KV) cache dropping, sparse attention, and prompt compression, typically rely
on rough predictions of token or KV pair importance. We propose a novel
framework for approximate LLM inference that leverages small draft models to
more accurately predict the importance of tokens and KV pairs. Specifically, we
introduce two instantiations of our proposed framework: (i) SpecKV, which
leverages a draft output to accurately assess the importance of each KV pair
for more effective KV cache dropping, and (ii) SpecPC, which uses the draft
model's attention activations to identify and discard unimportant prompt
tokens. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to use draft
models for approximate LLM inference acceleration, extending their utility
beyond traditional lossless speculative decoding. We motivate our methods with
theoretical and empirical analyses, and show a strong correlation between the
attention patterns of draft and target models. Extensive experiments on
long-context benchmarks show that our methods consistently achieve higher
accuracy than existing baselines, while preserving the same improvements in
memory usage, latency, and throughput. Our code is available at

Motivation: 现有基准测试在单任务环境中缺乏复杂性，无法反映真实场景的需求，因此需要更全面的评估工具。

Method: 提出了EIFBENCH基准测试，包含多任务场景和多样化约束，并开发了SegPO算法以提升LLMs的多任务处理能力。

Result: 评估显示现有LLMs在EIFBENCH上表现存在显著差距，表明需要进一步优化以应对复杂指令。

Conclusion: EIFBENCH为LLMs的复杂指令跟随能力提供了更真实的评估标准，并揭示了现有模型的不足，推动了优化需求。

Abstract: With the development and widespread application of large language models
(LLMs), the new paradigm of "Model as Product" is rapidly evolving, and demands
higher capabilities to address complex user needs, often requiring precise
workflow execution which involves the accurate understanding of multiple tasks.
However, existing benchmarks focusing on single-task environments with limited
constraints lack the complexity required to fully reflect real-world scenarios.
To bridge this gap, we present the Extremely Complex Instruction Following
Benchmark (EIFBENCH), meticulously crafted to facilitate a more realistic and
robust evaluation of LLMs. EIFBENCH not only includes multi-task scenarios that
enable comprehensive assessment across diverse task types concurrently, but
also integrates a variety of constraints, replicating complex operational
environments. Furthermore, we propose the Segment Policy Optimization (SegPO)
algorithm to enhance the LLM's ability to accurately fulfill multi-task
workflow. Evaluations on EIFBENCH have unveiled considerable performance
discrepancies in existing LLMs when challenged with these extremely complex
instructions. This finding underscores the necessity for ongoing optimization
to navigate the intricate challenges posed by LLM applications.

Result: 高资源与低资源语言（尤其是非洲和美洲/大洋洲语言）间性能差距显著。

Conclusion: 需增加投资以解决低资源语言在LLMs中的代表性不足问题。

Abstract: Large Language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on a
wide range of tasks, including in multimodal settings such as speech. However,
their evaluation is often limited to English and a few high-resource languages.
For low-resource languages, there is no standardized evaluation benchmark. In
this paper, we address this gap by introducing mSTEB, a new benchmark to
evaluate the performance of LLMs on a wide range of tasks covering language
identification, text classification, question answering, and translation tasks
on both speech and text modalities. We evaluated the performance of leading
LLMs such as Gemini 2.0 Flash and GPT-4o (Audio) and state-of-the-art open
models such as Qwen 2 Audio and Gemma 3 27B. Our evaluation shows a wide gap in
performance between high-resource and low-resource languages, especially for
languages spoken in Africa and Americas/Oceania. Our findings show that more
investment is needed to address their under-representation in LLMs coverage.

Conclusion: TACTIC通过认知理论驱动的多智能体协作，显著提升了机器翻译的质量，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Machine translation has long been a central task in natural language
processing. With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), there
has been remarkable progress in translation quality. However, fully realizing
the translation potential of LLMs remains an open challenge. Recent studies
have explored multi-agent systems to decompose complex translation tasks into
collaborative subtasks, showing initial promise in enhancing translation
quality through agent cooperation and specialization. Nevertheless, existing
multi-agent translation frameworks largely neglect foundational insights from
cognitive translation studies. These insights emphasize how human translators
employ different cognitive strategies, such as balancing literal and free
translation, refining expressions based on context, and iteratively evaluating
outputs. To address this limitation, we propose a cognitively informed
multi-agent framework called TACTIC, which stands for T ranslation A gents with
Cognitive- T heoretic Interactive Collaboration. The framework comprises six
functionally distinct agents that mirror key cognitive processes observed in
human translation behavior. These include agents for drafting, refinement,
evaluation, scoring, context reasoning, and external knowledge gathering. By
simulating an interactive and theory-grounded translation workflow, TACTIC
effectively leverages the full capacity of LLMs for high-quality translation.
Experimental results on diverse language pairs from the FLORES-200 and WMT24
benchmarks show that our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art
performance. Using DeepSeek-V3 as the base model, TACTIC surpasses GPT-4.1 by
an average of +0.6 XCOMET and +1.18 COMETKIWI-23. Compared to DeepSeek-R1, it
further improves by +0.84 XCOMET and +2.99 COMETKIWI-23. Code is available at

Abstract: Previous research has primarily focused on the cognitive error detection
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), often prompting them to analyze
mistakes in reasoning chains. However, few studies have examined the
meta-cognitive abilities of LLMs (e.g., their self-awareness of step errors),
which are crucial for their reliability. While studies on LLM self-evaluation
present some measures, such as perplexity, which can reflect the answer
correctness and be viewed as the lens of meta-cognition, they lack step-level
analysis and adaptation. This paper studies the evaluation of LLM
meta-cognition using the current lenses and how to improve these lenses.
Specifically, we propose AutoMeco, an Automated Meta-cognition Evaluation
framework for benchmarking the existing lenses. Furthermore, a training-free
Markovian Intrinsic Reward Adjustment strategy, MIRA, is proposed to boost
current meta-cognition lenses. Experimental results on three mathematical
reasoning datasets and three LLMs show the reasonableness of AutoMeco by
comparing it with Best-of-N verification. Moreover, the meta-cognition ability
of LLMs can be better evaluated using MIRA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前解释方法在输入数据格式和解释输出上存在差异，限制了实际应用，亟需一种统一且灵活的工具。

Method: 开发了一个可扩展的核心模块，能自动匹配不同输入数据与解释方法，并整合解释输出。

Result: Know-MRI支持用户根据输入自由选择解释方法，便于从多角度全面诊断模型内部知识机制。

Conclusion: Know-MRI为LLMs的知识机制分析提供了统一且灵活的工具，代码和演示视频已公开。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, there is a growing
urgency to enhance the interpretability of their internal knowledge mechanisms.
Consequently, many interpretation methods have emerged, aiming to unravel the
knowledge mechanisms of LLMs from various perspectives. However, current
interpretation methods differ in input data formats and interpreting outputs.
The tools integrating these methods are only capable of supporting tasks with
specific inputs, significantly constraining their practical applications. To
address these challenges, we present an open-source Knowledge Mechanisms
Revealer&Interpreter (Know-MRI) designed to analyze the knowledge mechanisms
within LLMs systematically. Specifically, we have developed an extensible core
module that can automatically match different input data with interpretation
methods and consolidate the interpreting outputs. It enables users to freely
choose appropriate interpretation methods based on the inputs, making it easier
to comprehensively diagnose the model's internal knowledge mechanisms from
multiple perspectives. Our code is available at
https://github.com/nlpkeg/Know-MRI. We also provide a demonstration video on

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CAF-I是一种基于大语言模型的多代理系统，用于解决讽刺检测中的单视角限制、理解不足和可解释性缺乏问题，通过多维分析和协作优化实现SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在讽刺检测中存在单视角限制、理解不足和可解释性缺乏的问题。

Method: 提出CAF-I框架，包含Context、Semantics和Rhetoric代理进行多维分析，Decision Agent整合结果，Refinement Evaluator Agent提供反馈优化。

Result: 在基准数据集上实现零样本SOTA性能，Macro-F1平均76.31，比之前最佳基线提升4.98。

Conclusion: CAF-I通过模拟人类多视角分析，显著提升了讽刺检测的准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) have become mainstream methods in the field of
sarcasm detection. However, existing LLM methods face challenges in irony
detection, including: 1. single-perspective limitations, 2. insufficient
comprehensive understanding, and 3. lack of interpretability. This paper
introduces the Collaborative Agent Framework for Irony (CAF-I), an LLM-driven
multi-agent system designed to overcome these issues. CAF-I employs specialized
agents for Context, Semantics, and Rhetoric, which perform multidimensional
analysis and engage in interactive collaborative optimization. A Decision Agent
then consolidates these perspectives, with a Refinement Evaluator Agent
providing conditional feedback for optimization. Experiments on benchmark
datasets establish CAF-I's state-of-the-art zero-shot performance. Achieving
SOTA on the vast majority of metrics, CAF-I reaches an average Macro-F1 of
76.31, a 4.98 absolute improvement over the strongest prior baseline. This
success is attained by its effective simulation of human-like multi-perspective
analysis, enhancing detection accuracy and interpretability.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了不同数值精度和数据并行化策略对LLM训练速度和模型精度的影响，旨在支持低资源环境下的领域适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）训练成本高，且易受主流文化和价值观影响。领域适应虽能改善模型与多样文化背景的匹配，但其计算成本仍是障碍。

Method: 评估不同数值精度和数据并行化策略对训练速度和模型精度的影响。

Result: 研究结果为关注能源效率、可访问性或硬件限制的场景提供了实用参考。

Conclusion: 通过优化数值精度和并行化策略，可在低资源环境中更高效地实现领域适应。

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) is costly in terms of energy, hardware,
and annotated data, often resulting in a positionality rooted in predominant
cultures and values (Santy et al., 2023). Domain adaptation has emerged as a
promising strategy to better align models with diverse cultural and value
contexts (Hershcovich et al., 2022), but its computational cost remains a
significant barrier, particularly for research groups lacking access to
large-scale infrastructure. In this paper, we evaluate how the use of different
numerical precisions and data parallelization strategies impacts both training
speed (as a proxy to energy and hardware consumption) and model accuracy, with
the goal of facilitating domain adaptation in low-resource environments. Our
findings are relevant to any setting where energy efficiency, accessibility, or
limited hardware availability are key concerns.

*Jiujun He,Huazhen Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Olica是一种无需重新训练的大型语言模型剪枝框架，通过正交分解和线性校准压缩模型，保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有剪枝方法需要大量计算和数据资源进行重新训练，成本高昂。

Method: 利用PCA处理多头注意力层的矩阵乘积，并通过快速分解和线性校准减少误差。

Result: 实验表明Olica在数据使用、GPU内存和运行时间上高效，性能优越。

Conclusion: Olica提供了一种高效且无需重新训练的LLM剪枝解决方案。

Abstract: Most existing structured pruning methods for Large Language Models (LLMs)
require substantial computational and data resources for retraining to
reestablish the corrupted correlations, making them prohibitively expensive. To
address this, we propose a pruning framework for LLMs called Orthogonal
decomposition and Linear Calibration (Olica), which eliminates the need for
retraining. A key observation is that the multi-head attention (MHA) layer
depends on two types of matrix products. By treating these matrix products as
unified entities and applying principal component analysis (PCA), we extract
the most important information to compress LLMs without sacrificing accuracy or
disrupting their original structure. Consequently, retraining becomes
unnecessary. A fast decomposition method is devised, reducing the complexity of
PCA by a factor of the square of the number of attention heads. Additionally,
to mitigate error accumulation problem caused by pruning the feed-forward
network (FFN) layer, we introduce a linear calibration method to reconstruct
the residual errors of pruned layers using low-rank matrices. By leveraging
singular value decomposition (SVD) on the solution of the least-squares
problem, these matrices are obtained without requiring retraining. Extensive
experiments show that the proposed Olica is efficient in terms of data usage,
GPU memory, and running time, while delivering superior performance across
multiple benchmarks.

Motivation: 当前有害模因检测方法在资源效率、灵活性和可解释性方面存在不足，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 开发了高保真的模因到文本转换管道，将视觉模因转化为文本描述，并结合零样本CoT提示和人工指导进行分类。

Result: 在七个基准数据集上的实验验证了框架的有效性，展示了其在小规模LLMs上的低资源和可解释性优势。

Conclusion: U-CoT+框架为有害模因检测提供了一种高效、灵活且可解释的解决方案，适用于不同平台和地区的需求。

Abstract: Detecting harmful memes is essential for maintaining the integrity of online
environments. However, current approaches often struggle with resource
efficiency, flexibility, or explainability, limiting their practical deployment
in content moderation systems. To address these challenges, we introduce
U-CoT+, a novel framework for harmful meme detection. Instead of relying solely
on prompting or fine-tuning multimodal models, we first develop a high-fidelity
meme-to-text pipeline that converts visual memes into detail-preserving textual
descriptions. This design decouples meme interpretation from meme
classification, thus avoiding immediate reasoning over complex raw visual
content and enabling resource-efficient harmful meme detection with general
large language models (LLMs). Building on these textual descriptions, we
further incorporate targeted, interpretable human-crafted guidelines to guide
models' reasoning under zero-shot CoT prompting. As such, this framework allows
for easy adaptation to different harmfulness detection criteria across
platforms, regions, and over time, offering high flexibility and
explainability. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets validate the
effectiveness of our framework, highlighting its potential for explainable and
low-resource harmful meme detection using small-scale LLMs. Codes and data are
available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/HMC-AF2B/README.md.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Adaptive-$k$ retrieval是一种单次自适应检索方法，根据查询与候选段落相似度分布动态选择段落数量，无需微调模型或额外推理，显著减少token使用并提高QA准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有自适应方法在聚合QA中因固定检索大小导致效率低下或遗漏关键证据的问题。

Method: 基于查询与候选段落相似度分布，动态选择段落数量，不依赖模型微调或额外推理。

Result: 在事实性和聚合QA基准测试中，Adaptive-$k$性能优于固定-$k$基线，减少10倍token使用，仍保留70%相关段落。

Conclusion: 动态调整上下文大小能更高效、准确地完成QA任务，适用于多种模型。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and long-context language models (LCLMs)
both address context limitations of LLMs in open-domain question answering
(QA). However, optimal external context to retrieve remains an open problem:
fixing the retrieval size risks either wasting tokens or omitting key evidence.
Existing adaptive methods like Self-RAG and Self-Route rely on iterative LLM
prompting and perform well on factoid QA, but struggle with aggregation QA,
where the optimal context size is both unknown and variable. We present
Adaptive-$k$ retrieval, a simple and effective single-pass method that
adaptively selects the number of passages based on the distribution of the
similarity scores between the query and the candidate passages. It does not
require model fine-tuning, extra LLM inferences or changes to existing
retriever-reader pipelines. On both factoid and aggregation QA benchmarks,
Adaptive-$k$ matches or outperforms fixed-$k$ baselines while using up to 10x
fewer tokens than full-context input, yet still retrieves 70% of relevant
passages. It improves accuracy across five LCLMs and two embedding models,
highlighting that dynamically adjusting context size leads to more efficient
and accurate QA.

Motivation: 现有评估主要依赖人类判断，忽略了评估框架的其他关键特性。

Method: 识别可靠评估的两个关键方面，实证分析当前主流框架的不足。

Result: 当前评估框架未能全面满足可靠评估的要求。

Conclusion: 提出改进图像-文本对齐评估的建议。

Abstract: Text-to-image models often struggle to generate images that precisely match
textual prompts. Prior research has extensively studied the evaluation of
image-text alignment in text-to-image generation. However, existing evaluations
primarily focus on agreement with human assessments, neglecting other critical
properties of a trustworthy evaluation framework. In this work, we first
identify two key aspects that a reliable evaluation should address. We then
empirically demonstrate that current mainstream evaluation frameworks fail to
fully satisfy these properties across a diverse range of metrics and models.
Finally, we propose recommendations for improving image-text alignment
evaluation.

Motivation: 随着LLM在推理和说服能力上的进步，尤其是DeepSeek R1和V3模型的崛起，为基于LLM代理的社交推理游戏（如狼人杀）提供了更吸引人的体验。

Method: 提出了一种新颖且直接的基于LLM的狼人杀系统，结合优化的TTS模型，以增强与不同LLM模型的兼容性和用户参与度。

Result: 系统通过优化的TTS模型提升了兼容性和用户体验，同时减少了对外部组件的依赖。

Conclusion: 随着LLM推理能力的持续增强，未来在狼人杀等游戏中，额外组件可能不再必要。

Abstract: The growing popularity of social deduction game systems for both business
applications and AI research has greatly benefited from the rapid advancements
in Large Language Models (LLMs), which now demonstrate stronger reasoning and
persuasion capabilities. Especially with the raise of DeepSeek R1 and V3
models, LLMs should enable a more engaging experience for human players in
LLM-agent-based social deduction games like Werewolf. Previous works either
fine-tuning, advanced prompting engineering, or additional experience pool to
achieve engaging text-format Werewolf game experience. We propose a novel yet
straightforward LLM-based Werewolf game system with tuned Text-to-Speech(TTS)
models designed for enhanced compatibility with various LLM models, and
improved user engagement. We argue with ever enhancing LLM reasoning, extra
components will be unnecessary in the case of Werewolf.

TL;DR: 论文首次大规模审计了参数规模在0.5到50亿之间的指令调优小型语言模型（SLMs），揭示了其公平性与性能的关系，并提供了实际部署建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着小型语言模型（SLMs）在资源受限环境中的快速应用，对其伦理风险的了解滞后，因此需要系统性评估其公平性和性能。

Method: 使用BBQ基准测试对9个开源模型（Qwen 2.5、LLaMA 3.2、Gemma 3和Phi系列）进行零样本提示下的公平性和性能分析。

Result: 发现：1）性能与公平性可共存（如Phi模型）；2）社会偏见因架构而异（Qwen 2.5表现中性但可能虚假，LLaMA 3.2偏见更强）；3）压缩技术带来复杂权衡（如4-bit AWQ量化提升性能但增加偏见）。

Conclusion: 研究为资源受限环境中公平高效的SLMs部署提供了实用指导，尤其有益于小型企业。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of Small Language Models (SLMs) for on-device and
resource-constrained deployments has outpaced our understanding of their
ethical risks. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first large-scale
audit of instruction-tuned SLMs spanning 0.5 to 5 billion parameters-an
overlooked "middle tier" between BERT-class encoders and flagship LLMs. Our
evaluation includes nine open-source models from the Qwen 2.5, LLaMA 3.2, Gemma
3, and Phi families. Using the BBQ benchmark under zero-shot prompting, we
analyze both utility and fairness across ambiguous and disambiguated contexts.
This evaluation reveals three key insights. First, competence and fairness need
not be antagonistic: Phi models achieve F1 scores exceeding 90 percent while
exhibiting minimal bias, showing that efficient and ethical NLP is attainable.
Second, social bias varies significantly by architecture: Qwen 2.5 models may
appear fair, but this often reflects vacuous neutrality, random guessing, or
evasive behavior rather than genuine ethical alignment. In contrast, LLaMA 3.2
models exhibit stronger stereotypical bias, suggesting overconfidence rather
than neutrality. Third, compression introduces nuanced trade-offs: 4-bit AWQ
quantization improves F1 scores in ambiguous settings for LLaMA 3.2-3B but
increases disability-related bias in Phi-4-Mini by over 7 percentage points.
These insights provide practical guidance for the responsible deployment of
SLMs in applications demanding fairness and efficiency, particularly benefiting
small enterprises and resource-constrained environments.

Result: 实验表明LLMs对某些地区存在固有偏见。

Conclusion: EtiCor++为评估LLMs的礼仪知识和偏见提供了有效工具，揭示了其文化敏感性问题。

Abstract: In recent years, researchers have started analyzing the cultural sensitivity
of LLMs. In this respect, Etiquettes have been an active area of research.
Etiquettes are region-specific and are an essential part of the culture of a
region; hence, it is imperative to make LLMs sensitive to etiquettes. However,
there needs to be more resources in evaluating LLMs for their understanding and
bias with regard to etiquettes. In this resource paper, we introduce EtiCor++,
a corpus of etiquettes worldwide. We introduce different tasks for evaluating
LLMs for knowledge about etiquettes across various regions. Further, we
introduce various metrics for measuring bias in LLMs. Extensive experimentation
with LLMs shows inherent bias towards certain regions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KD方法在训练过程中可能导致学生模型分布显著偏移，引发灾难性遗忘、模式崩溃等问题，亟需一种更稳定的训练框架。

Method: POCL框架包含两个核心组件：难度测量器（对样本从易到难排序）和训练调度器（逐步引入样本并调整损失函数温度）。

Result: 实验表明，POCL能显著提升蒸馏后学生模型的性能，适用于多种白盒KD方法和模型家族。

Conclusion: 排序训练样本能有效增强KD过程的稳定性与性能，为LLM的蒸馏提供了通用优化思路。

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) compresses large language models (LLMs) by
transferring the teacher model's capabilities to a smaller student model,
reducing inference cost and memory usage while maintaining performance.
However, existing KD methods for LLMs often fail to prevent significant shifts
in the student model's distribution during training, leading to issues such as
catastrophic forgetting, mode collapse, and training-inference mismatch. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel, plug-in curriculum learning
framework inspired by the strength training principle of "progressive overload"
(POCL), which can be seamlessly integrated into existing white-box KD
approaches with minimal computational overhead. The framework comprises two
core components: (1) a difficulty measurer that ranks and partitions training
samples from easy to hard, and (2) a training scheduler that incrementally
introduces these subsets into the distillation process at fixed intervals while
applying loss functions with progressively rising temperatures. By starting
with the easiest samples and progressively increasing the difficulty, the
approach enhances both the stability and efficiency of learning. Extensive
experiments in instruction-following settings demonstrate that POCL
consistently improves the performance of distilled student models across
various white-box KD methods and model families. Our findings highlight the
effectiveness of sorted training samples in KD for LLMs. More generally, our
work demonstrates how to structure training data within the KD process to
enhance the stability and performance of distilled LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督方法依赖标注数据且难以处理域外意图，限制了实际应用。广义意图发现（GID）通过利用未标注数据发现新意图，但现有方法忽略了域适应问题。

Method: 提出一致性驱动的原型提示框架，包括原型提示框架（转移旧知识）和分层一致性约束（学习新知识）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著优于基线方法，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: 该方法有效且具有泛化能力，代码已开源。

Abstract: Intent detection aims to identify user intents from natural language inputs,
where supervised methods rely heavily on labeled in-domain (IND) data and
struggle with out-of-domain (OOD) intents, limiting their practical
applicability. Generalized Intent Discovery (GID) addresses this by leveraging
unlabeled OOD data to discover new intents without additional annotation.
However, existing methods focus solely on clustering unsupervised data while
neglecting domain adaptation. Therefore, we propose a consistency-driven
prototype-prompting framework for GID from the perspective of integrating old
and new knowledge, which includes a prototype-prompting framework for
transferring old knowledge from external sources, and a hierarchical
consistency constraint for learning new knowledge from target domains. We
conducted extensive experiments and the results show that our method
significantly outperforms all baseline methods, achieving state-of-the-art
results, which strongly demonstrates the effectiveness and generalization of
our methods. Our source code is publicly available at

Result: LLMs在解决冲突时表现不佳，但通过提示改进可显著提升响应质量。

Conclusion: 未来研究需进一步改进LLMs处理知识冲突的能力。

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a commonly used approach for
enhancing large language models (LLMs) with relevant and up-to-date
information. However, the retrieved sources can often contain conflicting
information and it remains unclear how models should address such
discrepancies. In this work, we first propose a novel taxonomy of knowledge
conflict types in RAG, along with the desired model behavior for each type. We
then introduce CONFLICTS, a high-quality benchmark with expert annotations of
conflict types in a realistic RAG setting. CONFLICTS is the first benchmark
that enables tracking progress on how models address a wide range of knowledge
conflicts. We conduct extensive experiments on this benchmark, showing that
LLMs often struggle to appropriately resolve conflicts between sources. While
prompting LLMs to explicitly reason about the potential conflict in the
retrieved documents significantly improves the quality and appropriateness of
their responses, substantial room for improvement in future research remains.

Result: 在五个推理基准测试中验证了框架的有效性，MathQA任务上实现了5%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: 提出的框架通过优化潜在推理轨迹，显著提升了推理任务的性能，且无需额外训练。

Abstract: Reasoning is a key component of language understanding in Large Language
Models. While Chain-of-Thought prompting enhances performance via explicit
intermediate steps, it suffers from sufficient token overhead and a fixed
reasoning trajectory, preventing step-wise refinement. Recent advances in
latent reasoning address these limitations by refining internal reasoning
processes directly in the model's latent space, without producing explicit
outputs. However, a key challenge remains: how to effectively update reasoning
embeddings during post-training to guide the model toward more accurate
solutions. To overcome this challenge, we propose a lightweight post-training
framework that refines latent reasoning trajectories using two novel
strategies: 1) Contrastive reasoning feedback, which compares reasoning
embeddings against strong and weak baselines to infer effective update
directions via embedding enhancement; 2) Residual embedding refinement, which
stabilizes updates by progressively integrating current and historical
gradients, enabling fast yet controlled convergence. Extensive experiments and
case studies are conducted on five reasoning benchmarks to demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed framework. Notably, a 5\% accuracy gain on MathQA
without additional training.

Conclusion: 该方法为低资源语言研究和宏观-微观语言变异分析提供了新视角，未来将扩展至更多语言并整合社会语言学变异。

Abstract: Investigating linguistic relationships on a global scale requires analyzing
diverse features such as syntax, phonology and prosody, which evolve at varying
rates influenced by internal diversification, language contact, and
sociolinguistic factors. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) offer
complementary alternatives to traditional historical and typological
approaches. Instead of relying on expert labor in analyzing specific linguistic
features, these new methods enable the exploration of linguistic variation
through embeddings derived directly from speech, opening new avenues for
large-scale, data-driven analyses.
  This study employs embeddings from the fine-tuned XLS-R self-supervised
language identification model voxlingua107-xls-r-300m-wav2vec, to analyze
relationships between 106 world languages based on speech recordings. Using
linear discriminant analysis (LDA), language embeddings are clustered and
compared with genealogical, lexical, and geographical distances. The results
demonstrate that embedding-based distances align closely with traditional
measures, effectively capturing both global and local typological patterns.
Challenges in visualizing relationships, particularly with hierarchical
clustering and network-based methods, highlight the dynamic nature of language
change.
  The findings show potential for scalable analyses of language variation based
on speech embeddings, providing new perspectives on relationships among
languages. By addressing methodological considerations such as corpus size and
latent space dimensionality, this approach opens avenues for studying
low-resource languages and bridging macro- and micro-level linguistic
variation. Future work aims to extend these methods to underrepresented
languages and integrate sociolinguistic variation for a more comprehensive
understanding of linguistic diversity.

*Yahan Li,Jifan Yao,John Bosco S. Bunyi,Adam C. Frank,Angel Hwang,Ruishan Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CounselBench是一个用于评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在心理健康咨询中表现的基准测试，包含专家评估和对抗性数据集，发现LLMs在质量上优于人类治疗师，但存在安全隐患。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试LLMs在真实心理咨询场景中的行为，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 开发CounselBench基准测试，包含CounselBench-EVAL（专家评估）和CounselBench-Adv（对抗性数据集），评估LLMs在六个临床维度的表现。

Result: LLMs在感知质量上优于人类治疗师，但常被专家标记为存在安全隐患；LLM评估者易高估模型表现。

Conclusion: CounselBench为高风险的LLM心理健康应用提供了临床基准和改进框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly proposed for use in mental
health support, yet their behavior in realistic counseling scenarios remains
largely untested. We introduce CounselBench, a large-scale benchmark developed
with 100 mental health professionals to evaluate and stress-test LLMs in
single-turn counseling. The first component, CounselBench-EVAL, contains 2,000
expert evaluations of responses from GPT-4, LLaMA 3, Gemini, and online human
therapists to real patient questions. Each response is rated along six
clinically grounded dimensions, with written rationales and span-level
annotations. We find that LLMs often outperform online human therapists in
perceived quality, but experts frequently flag their outputs for safety
concerns such as unauthorized medical advice. Follow-up experiments show that
LLM judges consistently overrate model responses and overlook safety issues
identified by human experts. To probe failure modes more directly, we construct
CounselBench-Adv, an adversarial dataset of 120 expert-authored counseling
questions designed to trigger specific model issues. Evaluation across 2,880
responses from eight LLMs reveals consistent, model-specific failure patterns.
Together, CounselBench establishes a clinically grounded framework for
benchmarking and improving LLM behavior in high-stakes mental health settings.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了文本编码器在识别细粒度实体或事件时的局限性，提出了新的中文评估数据集CapRetrieval，并通过微调编码器提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本编码器的嵌入可能无法识别语义中的细粒度实体或事件，导致密集检索失败。

Method: 引入CapRetrieval数据集，提出数据生成策略微调编码器。

Result: 微调后的编码器在CapRetrieval上表现最佳，但发现粒度困境问题。

Conclusion: 公开了数据集、代码和模型，强调了细粒度语义表达的挑战。

Abstract: This work focuses on an observed limitation of text encoders: embeddings may
not be able to recognize fine-grained entities or events within the semantics,
resulting in failed dense retrieval on even simple cases. To examine such
behaviors, we first introduce a new evaluation dataset in Chinese, named
CapRetrieval, whose passages are image captions, and queries are phrases
inquiring entities or events in various forms. Zero-shot evaluation suggests
that encoders may fail on these fine-grained matching, regardless of training
sources or model sizes. Aiming for enhancement, we proceed to finetune encoders
with our proposed data generation strategies, which obtains the best
performance on CapRetrieval. Within this process, we further identify an issue
of granularity dilemma, a challenge for embeddings to express fine-grained
salience while aligning with overall semantics. Our dataset, code and models in
this work are publicly released at https://github.com/lxucs/CapRetrieval.

Motivation: 仇恨言论检测具有社会敏感性和主观性，但人格特质对LLMs的影响尚未充分研究。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过人类标注调查验证MBTI特质对标注行为的影响，并在四个开源LLMs中引入MBTI人格提示，评估其在三个仇恨言论数据集上的表现。

Result: 研究发现人格提示导致显著的分类差异，包括与真实标签的不一致、人格间分歧和逻辑层面的偏见。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在LLM标注流程中谨慎定义人格提示的重要性，以确保公平性和与人类价值观的对齐。

Abstract: Hate speech detection is a socially sensitive and inherently subjective task,
with judgments often varying based on personal traits. While prior work has
examined how socio-demographic factors influence annotation, the impact of
personality traits on Large Language Models (LLMs) remains largely unexplored.
In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study on the role of persona
prompts in hate speech classification, focusing on MBTI-based traits. A human
annotation survey confirms that MBTI dimensions significantly affect labeling
behavior. Extending this to LLMs, we prompt four open-source models with MBTI
personas and evaluate their outputs across three hate speech datasets. Our
analysis uncovers substantial persona-driven variation, including
inconsistencies with ground truth, inter-persona disagreement, and logit-level
biases. These findings highlight the need to carefully define persona prompts
in LLM-based annotation workflows, with implications for fairness and alignment
with human values.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学推理需要长链推理、领域术语知识和适应新发现，RAISE旨在解决这些挑战。

Method: RAISE分为三步：问题分解、逻辑查询生成和逻辑检索，从广泛语料库中检索逻辑相关文档。

Result: RAISE在科学推理基准测试中表现优于其他基线方法，检索的文档不仅领域相似，逻辑相关性也更强。

Conclusion: RAISE通过逻辑相关文档检索，提升了科学推理的效果。

Abstract: Scientific reasoning requires not only long-chain reasoning processes, but
also knowledge of domain-specific terminologies and adaptation to updated
findings. To deal with these challenges for scientific reasoning, we introduce
RAISE, a step-by-step retrieval-augmented framework which retrieves logically
relevant documents from in-the-wild corpus. RAISE is divided into three steps:
problem decomposition, logical query generation, and logical retrieval. We
observe that RAISE consistently outperforms other baselines on scientific
reasoning benchmarks. We analyze that unlike other baselines, RAISE retrieves
documents that are not only similar in terms of the domain knowledge, but also
documents logically more relevant.

TL;DR: MEMETRON是一个任务无关的框架，将LLM解码问题转化为离散黑盒优化问题，通过混合元启发式算法搜索高奖励响应，无需模型重训练或梯度访问。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM的解码策略（如贪婪搜索、采样或重排序）缺乏对任务特定目标的明确优化，限制了控制能力。

Method: MEMETRON利用混合元启发式算法（GENETRON和ANNETRON），基于奖励模型和LLM的上下文操作搜索响应空间。

Result: 在人类偏好对齐任务中，MEMETRON显著优于标准解码和重排序方法。

Conclusion: MEMETRON展示了在不重训练模型的情况下提升对齐效果的潜力，具有模块化和通用性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for both open-ended and
structured tasks, yet their inference-time behavior is still largely dictated
by heuristic decoding strategies such as greedy search, sampling, or reranking.
These methods provide limited control and do not explicitly optimize for
task-specific objectives. We introduce MEMETRON, a task-agnostic framework that
formulates LLM decoding as a discrete black-box optimization problem. MEMETRON
leverages hybrid metaheuristic algorithms, GENETRON and ANNETRON, to search the
response space, guided by reward models and contextual operations performed by
the LLM itself. This approach enables efficient discovery of high-reward
responses without requiring model retraining or gradient access. The framework
is modular and generalizes across diverse tasks, requiring only a reward
function and lightweight prompt templates. We evaluate our framework on the
critical human preference alignment task and demonstrate that it significantly
outperforms standard decoding and reranking methods, highlighting its potential
to improve alignment without model retraining.

TL;DR: TableDreamer是一个渐进式、弱点导向的数据合成框架，用于解决LLM在表格指令调优中数据多样性和效率不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM数据合成方法在表格理解任务中无法充分探索输入空间且忽视目标LLM的弱点，导致数据多样性和效率不足。

Method: 通过合成多样化表格和指令作为种子数据，并在新识别的弱点数据指导下迭代探索输入空间，生成最终训练数据。

Result: 在10个表格基准测试中，TableDreamer将Llama3.1-8B-instruct的平均准确率提升11.62%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TableDreamer显著提升了表格指令调优的数据效率和模型性能。

Abstract: Despite the commendable progress of recent LLM-based data synthesis methods,
they face two limitations in generating table instruction tuning data. First,
they can not thoroughly explore the vast input space of table understanding
tasks, leading to limited data diversity. Second, they ignore the weaknesses in
table understanding ability of the target LLM and blindly pursue the increase
of data quantity, resulting in suboptimal data efficiency. In this paper, we
introduce a progressive and weakness-guided data synthesis framework tailored
for table instruction tuning, named TableDreamer, to mitigate the above issues.
Specifically, we first synthesize diverse tables and related instructions as
seed data, and then perform an iterative exploration of the input space under
the guidance of the newly identified weakness data, which eventually serve as
the final training data for fine-tuning the target LLM. Extensive experiments
on 10 tabular benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
framework, which boosts the average accuracy of Llama3.1-8B-instruct by 11.62%
(49.07% to 60.69%) with 27K GPT-4o synthetic data and outperforms
state-of-the-art data synthesis baselines which use more training data. The

Result: 初步结果显示摘要生成能提升生成式关系提取性能，但BERT方法仍更优。

Conclusion: 生成式方法在低资源专业领域研究中具有潜力，但仍需改进。

Abstract: We explore a generative relation extraction (RE) pipeline tailored to the
study of interactions in the intestinal microbiome, a complex and low-resource
biomedical domain. Our method leverages summarization with large language
models (LLMs) to refine context before extracting relations via
instruction-tuned generation. Preliminary results on a dedicated corpus show
that summarization improves generative RE performance by reducing noise and
guiding the model. However, BERT-based RE approaches still outperform
generative models. This ongoing work demonstrates the potential of generative
methods to support the study of specialized domains in low-resources setting.

Result: 在分布内和分布外任务上显著优于大型推理模型，计算效率也更高。

Conclusion: RuleReasoner是一种简单有效的方法，能够提升小型推理模型的规则推理能力，并具有较高的计算效率。

Abstract: Rule-based reasoning has been acknowledged as one of the fundamental problems
in reasoning, while deviations in rule formats, types, and complexity in
real-world applications pose severe challenges. Recent studies have shown that
large reasoning models (LRMs) have remarkable reasoning capabilities, and their
performance is substantially enhanced by reinforcement learning (RL). However,
it remains an open question whether small reasoning models (SRMs) can learn
rule-based reasoning effectively with robust generalization across diverse
tasks and domains. To address this, we introduce Reinforced Rule-based
Reasoning, a.k.a. RuleReasoner, a simple yet effective method to conduct
rule-based reasoning via a wide collection of curated tasks and a novel
domain-aware dynamic sampling approach. Specifically, RuleReasoner resamples
each training batch by updating the sampling weights of different domains based
on historical rewards. This facilitates domain augmentation and flexible online
learning schedules for RL, obviating the need for pre-hoc human-engineered
mix-training recipes used in existing methods. Empirical evaluations on
in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmarks reveal that
RuleReasoner outperforms frontier LRMs by a significant margin ($\Delta$4.1%
average points on eight ID tasks and $\Delta$10.4% average points on three OOD
tasks over OpenAI-o1). Notably, our approach also exhibits higher computational
efficiency compared to prior dynamic sampling methods for RL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM推理过程消耗大量能源，而输出压缩领域尚未充分探索，因此开发能源高效的方法至关重要。

Method: 对12种解码器LLM在5个数据集上进行基准测试，定义LLM响应中的六类信息，并探索提示工程策略以减少响应长度。

Result: 通过优化提示策略，可在保持响应质量的同时减少25-60%的能源消耗。

Conclusion: 提示工程是减少LLM响应长度和能源消耗的有效方法，未来可进一步探索其他优化策略。

Abstract: A significant portion of the energy consumed by Large Language Models (LLMs)
arises from their inference processes; hence developing energy-efficient
methods for inference is crucial. While several techniques exist for inference
optimization, output compression remains relatively unexplored, with only a few
preliminary efforts addressing this aspect. In this work, we first benchmark 12
decoder-only LLMs across 5 datasets, revealing that these models often produce
responses that are substantially longer than necessary. We then conduct a
comprehensive quality assessment of LLM responses, formally defining six
information categories present in LLM responses. We show that LLMs often tend
to include redundant or additional information besides the minimal answer. To
address this issue of long responses by LLMs, we explore several simple and
intuitive prompt-engineering strategies. Empirical evaluation shows that
appropriate prompts targeting length reduction and controlling information
content can achieve significant energy optimization between 25-60\% by reducing
the response length while preserving the quality of LLM responses.

Motivation: 科学事实核查主要关注文本和表格，忽略了科学图表的重要性。

Method: 引入ClimateViz基准，评估多模态语言模型在零样本和少样本设置下的表现，并分析结构化知识图谱解释的效果。

Result: 最佳模型（如Gemini 2.5和InternVL 2.5）在标签设置下准确率仅为76.2%至77.8%，远低于人类水平（89.3%和92.7%）。

Conclusion: 当前模型在图表推理上仍有不足，解释增强输出对部分模型有提升。数据集和代码已公开。

Abstract: Scientific fact-checking has mostly focused on text and tables, overlooking
scientific charts, which are key for presenting quantitative evidence and
statistical reasoning. We introduce ClimateViz, the first large-scale benchmark
for scientific fact-checking using expert-curated scientific charts. ClimateViz
contains 49,862 claims linked to 2,896 visualizations, each labeled as support,
refute, or not enough information. To improve interpretability, each example
includes structured knowledge graph explanations covering trends, comparisons,
and causal relations. We evaluate state-of-the-art multimodal language models,
including both proprietary and open-source systems, in zero-shot and few-shot
settings. Results show that current models struggle with chart-based reasoning:
even the best systems, such as Gemini 2.5 and InternVL 2.5, reach only 76.2 to
77.8 percent accuracy in label-only settings, far below human performance (89.3
and 92.7 percent). Explanation-augmented outputs improve performance in some
models. We released our dataset and code alongside the paper.

Motivation: 现有直接对齐算法（如DPO）对所有令牌进行均匀调整，而ConfPO专注于对偏好影响最大的令牌，以提高效率并避免过度优化。

Method: ConfPO基于训练策略的置信度识别并优化偏好关键令牌，无需依赖辅助模型或额外计算资源。

Result: 在AlpacaEval 2和Arena-Hard等基准测试中，ConfPO表现优于均匀调整的直接对齐算法，且无需额外计算开销。

Conclusion: ConfPO是一种轻量级、高效且无需辅助模型的偏好学习方法，显著提升LLM的对齐质量。

Abstract: We introduce ConfPO, a method for preference learning in Large Language
Models (LLMs) that identifies and optimizes preference-critical tokens based
solely on the training policy's confidence, without requiring any auxiliary
models or compute. Unlike prior Direct Alignment Algorithms (DAAs) such as
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which uniformly adjust all token
probabilities regardless of their relevance to preference, ConfPO focuses
optimization on the most impactful tokens. This targeted approach improves
alignment quality while mitigating overoptimization (i.e., reward hacking) by
using the KL divergence budget more efficiently. In contrast to recent
token-level methods that rely on credit-assignment models or AI annotators,
raising concerns about scalability and reliability, ConfPO is simple,
lightweight, and model-free. Experimental results on challenging alignment
benchmarks, including AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard, demonstrate that ConfPO
consistently outperforms uniform DAAs across various LLMs, delivering better
alignment with zero additional computational overhead.

Conclusion: NLI方法在自动化监管合规过程中具有潜力。

Abstract: Ensuring complex systems meet regulations typically requires checking the
validity of assurance cases through a claim-argument-evidence framework. Some
challenges in this process include the complicated nature of legal and
technical texts, the need for model explanations, and limited access to
assurance case data. We propose a compliance detection approach based on
Natural Language Inference (NLI): EXplainable CompLiance detection with
Argumentative Inference of Multi-hop reasoning (EXCLAIM). We formulate the
claim-argument-evidence structure of an assurance case as a multi-hop inference
for explainable and traceable compliance detection. We address the limited
number of assurance cases by generating them using large language models
(LLMs). We introduce metrics that measure the coverage and structural
consistency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the generated assurance case
from GDPR requirements in a multi-hop inference task as a case study. Our
results highlight the potential of NLI-based approaches in automating the
regulatory compliance process.

Motivation: 尽管单语言SER取得了进展，但构建多语言系统仍具挑战性。本文旨在通过从多个教师模型中蒸馏知识，训练一个单一的多语言SER模型。

Method: 利用Wav2Vec2.0作为单语言教师模型的基础，并通过语言感知的多教师知识蒸馏方法将其知识蒸馏到一个多语言学生模型中。

Result: 学生模型在英语数据集的加权召回率达到72.9，芬兰语数据集的未加权召回率为63.4，超越了微调和知识蒸馏基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在提升悲伤和中性情感的识别效果上表现优异，但在识别愤怒和快乐情感方面仍存在挑战。

Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is crucial for improving human-computer
interaction. Despite strides in monolingual SER, extending them to build a
multilingual system remains challenging. Our goal is to train a single model
capable of multilingual SER by distilling knowledge from multiple teacher
models. To address this, we introduce a novel language-aware multi-teacher
knowledge distillation method to advance SER in English, Finnish, and French.
It leverages Wav2Vec2.0 as the foundation of monolingual teacher models and
then distills their knowledge into a single multilingual student model. The
student model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, with a weighted recall
of 72.9 on the English dataset and an unweighted recall of 63.4 on the Finnish
dataset, surpassing fine-tuning and knowledge distillation baselines. Our
method excels in improving recall for sad and neutral emotions, although it
still faces challenges in recognizing anger and happiness.

Result: 改进的批评代理和计算器代理在性能上优于现有方法，且更安全。同时，代理间的交互对性能有显著影响。

Conclusion: 论文展示了改进代理在金融文档数值问答任务中的有效性，并强调了代理交互的重要性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities on numerous
natural language processing tasks. However, LLMs still struggle with numerical
question answering for financial documents that include tabular and textual
data. Recent works have showed the effectiveness of critic agents (i.e.,
self-correction) for this task given oracle labels. Building upon this
framework, this paper examines the effectiveness of the traditional critic
agent when oracle labels are not available, and show, through experiments, that
this critic agent's performance deteriorates in this scenario. With this in
mind, we present an improved critic agent, along with the calculator agent
which outperforms the previous state-of-the-art approach (program-of-thought)
and is safer. Furthermore, we investigate how our agents interact with each
other, and how this interaction affects their performance.

Motivation: 探讨AI开发如何与伦理和社会价值对齐，以及跨学科合作是否在实践中推动这一转变。

Method: 开发分类器识别社会内容，测量论文中社会考量的表达程度。

Result: 计算机科学团队越来越多地将社会问题融入研究，涉及公平、安全、医疗等多个领域。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了跨学科团队主导社会AI的假设，并引发对技术团队主导社会研究的未来影响及人文学科独特贡献的思考。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) systems become deeply embedded in everyday
life, calls to align AI development with ethical and societal values have
intensified. Interdisciplinary collaboration is often championed as a key
pathway for fostering such engagement. Yet it remains unclear whether
interdisciplinary research teams are actually leading this shift in practice.
This study analyzes over 100,000 AI-related papers published on ArXiv between
2014 and 2024 to examine how ethical values and societal concerns are
integrated into technical AI research. We develop a classifier to identify
societal content and measure the extent to which research papers express these
considerations. We find a striking shift: while interdisciplinary teams remain
more likely to produce societally-oriented research, computer science-only
teams now account for a growing share of the field's overall societal output.
These teams are increasingly integrating societal concerns into their papers
and tackling a wide range of domains - from fairness and safety to healthcare
and misinformation. These findings challenge common assumptions about the
drivers of societal AI and raise important questions. First, what are the
implications for emerging understandings of AI safety and governance if most
societally-oriented research is being undertaken by exclusively technical
teams? Second, for scholars in the social sciences and humanities: in a
technical field increasingly responsive to societal demands, what distinctive
perspectives can we still offer to help shape the future of AI?

Result: 模型能够捕捉专业核词汇，但生成文本的句法连贯性有待提高。初步展示了在专业任务中的实用性。

Conclusion: 未来需扩展数据集、优化预处理和指令微调以提高准确性，并评估模型在核领域的实际应用准备度。

Abstract: This paper introduces a domain-specific Large Language Model for nuclear
applications, built from the publicly accessible Essential CANDU textbook.
Drawing on a compact Transformer-based architecture, the model is trained on a
single GPU to protect the sensitive data inherent in nuclear operations.
Despite relying on a relatively small dataset, it shows encouraging signs of
capturing specialized nuclear vocabulary, though the generated text sometimes
lacks syntactic coherence. By focusing exclusively on nuclear content, this
approach demonstrates the feasibility of in-house LLM solutions that align with
rigorous cybersecurity and data confidentiality standards. Early successes in
text generation underscore the model's utility for specialized tasks, while
also revealing the need for richer corpora, more sophisticated preprocessing,
and instruction fine-tuning to enhance domain accuracy. Future directions
include extending the dataset to cover diverse nuclear subtopics, refining
tokenization to reduce noise, and systematically evaluating the model's
readiness for real-world applications in nuclear domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 核工业中存在大量非结构化文本数据，但这些数据无法直接用于需要结构化问答对的LLM任务。

Method: 利用合成数据生成技术，将现有文本数据转化为可用的问答对，并通过LLM分析、提取关键信息、生成问题并评估数据集质量。

Result: 合成数据为核工业中的LLM应用提供了解决方案，解决了数据稀缺和隐私问题。

Conclusion: 合成数据有望推动核工业中的信息检索、知识共享和决策支持的发展。

Abstract: The nuclear industry possesses a wealth of valuable information locked away
in unstructured text data. This data, however, is not readily usable for
advanced Large Language Model (LLM) applications that require clean, structured
question-answer pairs for tasks like model training, fine-tuning, and
evaluation. This paper explores how synthetic data generation can bridge this
gap, enabling the development of robust LLMs for the nuclear domain. We discuss
the challenges of data scarcity and privacy concerns inherent in the nuclear
industry and how synthetic data provides a solution by transforming existing
text data into usable Q&A pairs. This approach leverages LLMs to analyze text,
extract key information, generate relevant questions, and evaluate the quality
of the resulting synthetic dataset. By unlocking the potential of LLMs in the
nuclear industry, synthetic data can pave the way for improved information
retrieval, enhanced knowledge sharing, and more informed decision-making in
this critical sector.

performance. This work is conducted using the MultiWoZ2.4 dataset and focuses
primarily on the OLMo-7B-instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, and

*Mishca de Costa,Muhammad Anwar,Dave Mercier,Mark Randall,Issam Hammad*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于函数调用的大型语言模型（LLM）方法，用于核电站数据检索，以替代传统的自然语言转SQL（NL-to-SQL）方法，提高准确性和可维护性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统NL-to-SQL方法在核电站数据检索中存在风险，如用户难以验证生成的SQL查询，且复杂的历史数据库结构增加了查询生成的难度，导致准确性和信任度下降。

Method: 通过预定义一组经过审核的、特定用途的函数，封装已验证的SQL逻辑，避免直接生成SQL查询。利用NL-to-SQL工具辅助生成函数代码，专家专注于验证而非创建。

Result: 研究表明，基于函数的方法在准确性和可维护性上优于直接NL-to-SQL生成，平衡了用户易用性与操作安全性。

Conclusion: 该工作为关键系统提供了一种新颖且可操作的数据检索框架，强调了用户可访问性与操作安全性的平衡。

Abstract: Retrieving operational data from nuclear power plants requires exceptional
accuracy and transparency due to the criticality of the decisions it supports.
Traditionally, natural language to SQL (NL-to-SQL) approaches have been
explored for querying such data. While NL-to-SQL promises ease of use, it poses
significant risks: end-users cannot easily validate generated SQL queries, and
legacy nuclear plant databases -- often complex and poorly structured --
complicate query generation due to decades of incremental modifications. These
challenges increase the likelihood of inaccuracies and reduce trust in the
approach. In this work, we propose an alternative paradigm: leveraging
function-calling large language models (LLMs) to address these challenges.
Instead of directly generating SQL queries, we define a set of pre-approved,
purpose-specific functions representing common use cases. Queries are processed
by invoking these functions, which encapsulate validated SQL logic. This hybrid
approach mitigates the risks associated with direct NL-to-SQL translations by
ensuring that SQL queries are reviewed and optimized by experts before
deployment. While this strategy introduces the upfront cost of developing and
maintaining the function library, we demonstrate how NL-to-SQL tools can assist
in the initial generation of function code, allowing experts to focus on
validation rather than creation. Our study includes a performance comparison
between direct NL-to-SQL generation and the proposed function-based approach,
highlighting improvements in accuracy and maintainability. This work
underscores the importance of balancing user accessibility with operational
safety and provides a novel, actionable framework for robust data retrieval in
critical systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿拉伯语因其丰富的形态、多样的方言和复杂的文字，LLM在该语言上的表现尚未充分研究，论文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过零样本、少样本和微调策略，在15个阿拉伯语NLP任务上系统评估LLM的性能。

Result: 研究发现：1）选择3个上下文示例可显著提升分类任务性能；2）DeepSeek在零样本设置下优于GPT o4-mini；3）LoRA微调比模型规模扩展更有效。

Conclusion: 论文表明，通过策略优化和模型选择，LLM在阿拉伯语任务中表现优异，为未来研究提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in reasoning
abilities and general natural language processing (NLP) tasks, yet their
performance on Arabic data, characterized by rich morphology, diverse dialects,
and complex script, remains underexplored. This paper presents a comprehensive
benchmarking study of multiple reasoning-focused LLMs, with a special emphasis
on the newly introduced DeepSeek models, across a suite of fifteen Arabic NLP
tasks. We experiment with various strategies, including zero-shot, few-shot,
and fine-tuning. This allows us to systematically evaluate performance on
datasets covering a range of applications to examine their capacity for
linguistic reasoning under different levels of complexity. Our experiments
reveal several key findings. First, carefully selecting just three in-context
examples delivers an average uplift of over 13 F1 points on classification
tasks-boosting sentiment analysis from 35.3% to 87.5% and paraphrase detection
from 56.1% to 87.0%. Second, reasoning-focused DeepSeek architectures
outperform a strong GPT o4-mini baseline by an average of 12 F1 points on
complex inference tasks in the zero-shot setting. Third, LoRA-based fine-tuning
yields up to an additional 8 points in F1 and BLEU compared to equivalent
increases in model scale. The code is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种从法律文档中提取交通事故信息的两步法，通过文本分割和实体提取，比较了传统方法和基于语义搜索的方法，并展示了微调后LLaMA-2 70B和LLaMA-3 8B的性能提升，GPT-4 Turbo表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从法律文档中提取交通事故信息对量化保险公司成本至关重要，但由于法院判决中的复杂论证，即使是专家也难以准确提取相关实体。

Method: 采用两步法：1) 文本分割（正则表达式或语义搜索）；2) 使用LLMs（LLaMA-2、LLaMA-3、GPT-4 Turbo）进行实体提取，并对LLaMA模型进行LoRA微调。

Result: 基于语义搜索和LLMs的方法显著优于传统方法（39.5%）。微调后的LLaMA-2 70B达到79.4%，LLaMA-3 8B基础模型为76.6%，GPT-4 Turbo表现最佳（86.1%）。

Conclusion: 语义搜索结合LLMs的方法在实体提取中表现优异，微调和模型进步（如LLaMA-3）显著提升性能，GPT-4 Turbo为当前最优解。

Abstract: The extraction of information about traffic accidents from legal documents is
crucial for quantifying insurance company costs. Extracting entities such as
percentages of physical and/or psychological disability and the involved
compensation amounts is a challenging process, even for experts, due to the
subtle arguments and reasoning in the court decision. A two-step procedure is
proposed: first, segmenting the document identifying the most relevant
segments, and then extracting the entities. For text segmentation, two
methodologies are compared: a classic method based on regular expressions and a
second approach that divides the document into blocks of n-tokens, which are
then vectorized using multilingual models for semantic searches
(text-embedding-ada-002/MiniLM-L12-v2 ). Subsequently, large language models
(LLaMA-2 7b, 70b, LLaMA-3 8b, and GPT-4 Turbo) are applied with prompting to
the selected segments for entity extraction. For the LLaMA models, fine-tuning
is performed using LoRA. LLaMA-2 7b, even with zero temperature, shows a
significant number of hallucinations in extractions which are an important
contention point for named entity extraction. This work shows that these
hallucinations are substantially reduced after finetuning the model. The
performance of the methodology based on segment vectorization and subsequent
use of LLMs significantly surpasses the classic method which achieves an
accuracy of 39.5%. Among open-source models, LLaMA-2 70B with finetuning
achieves the highest accuracy 79.4%, surpassing its base version 61.7%.
Notably, the base LLaMA-3 8B model already performs comparably to the finetuned
LLaMA-2 70B model, achieving 76.6%, highlighting the rapid progress in model
development. Meanwhile, GPT-4 Turbo achieves the highest accuracy at 86.1%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 瑞士德语缺乏标准化书写形式，现有数据集在自然对话语音中表现不佳，需要更真实的数据集来改进模型。

Method: 使用SRB-300数据集（包含300小时的真实世界录音）微调多个OpenAI Whisper模型。

Result: 微调后，词错误率（WER）降低19%-33%，BLEU分数提升8%-40%，最佳模型WER为17.1%，BLEU为74.8%。

Conclusion: SRB-300数据集和微调方法显著提升了瑞士德语语音转文本模型的性能，适用于其他低资源语言。

Abstract: Swiss German is a low-resource language represented by diverse dialects that
differ significantly from Standard German and from each other, lacking a
standardized written form. As a result, transcribing Swiss German involves
translating into Standard German. Existing datasets have been collected in
controlled environments, yielding effective speech-to-text (STT) models, but
these models struggle with spontaneous conversational speech.
  This paper, therefore, introduces the new SRB-300 dataset, a 300-hour
annotated speech corpus featuring real-world long-audio recordings from 39
Swiss German radio and TV stations. It captures spontaneous speech across all
major Swiss dialects recorded in various realistic environments and overcomes
the limitation of prior sentence-level corpora.
  We fine-tuned multiple OpenAI Whisper models on the SRB-300 dataset,
achieving notable enhancements over previous zero-shot performance metrics.
Improvements in word error rate (WER) ranged from 19% to 33%, while BLEU scores
increased between 8% and 40%. The best fine-tuned model, large-v3, achieved a
WER of 17.1% and a BLEU score of 74.8. This advancement is crucial for
developing effective and robust STT systems for Swiss German and other
low-resource languages in real-world contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗性威胁增长快于防御能力，现有防御方法（如DPO）无法识别潜在几何伪装。

Method: 引入ALKALI对抗基准和GRACE框架，通过潜在空间正则化增强对齐。

Result: GRACE降低攻击成功率39%，AVQI指标量化潜在对齐失败。

Conclusion: GRACE和AVQI为LLM安全性提供了新工具，揭示了潜在几何伪装问题。

Abstract: Adversarial threats against LLMs are escalating faster than current defenses
can adapt. We expose a critical geometric blind spot in alignment: adversarial
prompts exploit latent camouflage, embedding perilously close to the safe
representation manifold while encoding unsafe intent thereby evading surface
level defenses like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which remain blind to
the latent geometry. We introduce ALKALI, the first rigorously curated
adversarial benchmark and the most comprehensive to date spanning 9,000 prompts
across three macro categories, six subtypes, and fifteen attack families.
Evaluation of 21 leading LLMs reveals alarmingly high Attack Success Rates
(ASRs) across both open and closed source models, exposing an underlying
vulnerability we term latent camouflage, a structural blind spot where
adversarial completions mimic the latent geometry of safe ones. To mitigate
this vulnerability, we introduce GRACE - Geometric Representation Aware
Contrastive Enhancement, an alignment framework coupling preference learning
with latent space regularization. GRACE enforces two constraints: latent
separation between safe and adversarial completions, and adversarial cohesion
among unsafe and jailbreak behaviors. These operate over layerwise pooled
embeddings guided by a learned attention profile, reshaping internal geometry
without modifying the base model, and achieve up to 39% ASR reduction.
Moreover, we introduce AVQI, a geometry aware metric that quantifies latent
alignment failure via cluster separation and compactness. AVQI reveals when
unsafe completions mimic the geometry of safe ones, offering a principled lens
into how models internally encode safety. We make the code publicly available
at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/alkali-B416/README.md.

Conclusion: PlantBert为农业NLP提供了可扩展的框架，推动了植物科学领域的跨学科创新。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of transformer-based language models has catalyzed
breakthroughs in biomedical and clinical natural language processing; however,
plant science remains markedly underserved by such domain-adapted tools. In
this work, we present PlantBert, a high-performance, open-source language model
specifically tailored for extracting structured knowledge from plant
stress-response literature. Built upon the DeBERTa architecture-known for its
disentangled attention and robust contextual encoding-PlantBert is fine-tuned
on a meticulously curated corpus of expert-annotated abstracts, with a primary
focus on lentil (Lens culinaris) responses to diverse abiotic and biotic
stressors. Our methodology combines transformer-based modeling with
rule-enhanced linguistic post-processing and ontology-grounded entity
normalization, enabling PlantBert to capture biologically meaningful
relationships with precision and semantic fidelity. The underlying corpus is
annotated using a hierarchical schema aligned with the Crop Ontology,
encompassing molecular, physiological, biochemical, and agronomic dimensions of
plant adaptation. PlantBert exhibits strong generalization capabilities across
entity types and demonstrates the feasibility of robust domain adaptation in
low-resource scientific fields. By providing a scalable and reproducible
framework for high-resolution entity recognition, PlantBert bridges a critical
gap in agricultural NLP and paves the way for intelligent, data-driven systems
in plant genomics, phenomics, and agronomic knowledge discovery. Our model is
publicly released to promote transparency and accelerate cross-disciplinary
innovation in computational plant science.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to the automated semantic analysis of legal texts
using large language models (LLMs), targeting their transformation into formal
representations in Defeasible Deontic Logic (DDL). We propose a structured
pipeline that segments complex normative language into atomic snippets,
extracts deontic rules, and evaluates them for syntactic and semantic
coherence. Our methodology is evaluated across various LLM configurations,
including prompt engineering strategies, fine-tuned models, and multi-stage
pipelines, focusing on legal norms from the Australian Telecommunications
Consumer Protections Code. Empirical results demonstrate promising alignment
between machine-generated and expert-crafted formalizations, showing that LLMs

Method: 结合基于规则的语言学转换和大型语言模型（LLMs）的少样本提示，无需平行数据，应用于希腊方言的归一化。

Result: 在谚语数据集上验证了方法的有效性，发现之前的研究仅依赖表层语言信息，而新方法能保留更多语义信息。

Conclusion: 提出的归一化方法有效，且能揭示更多语义信息，为方言处理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Natural language understanding systems struggle with low-resource languages,
including many dialects of high-resource ones. Dialect-to-standard
normalization attempts to tackle this issue by transforming dialectal text so
that it can be used by standard-language tools downstream. In this study, we
tackle this task by introducing a new normalization method that combines
rule-based linguistically informed transformations and large language models
(LLMs) with targeted few-shot prompting, without requiring any parallel data.
We implement our method for Greek dialects and apply it on a dataset of
regional proverbs, evaluating the outputs using human annotators. We then use
this dataset to conduct downstream experiments, finding that previous results
regarding these proverbs relied solely on superficial linguistic information,
including orthographic artifacts, while new observations can still be made
through the remaining semantics.

Result: 在RippleEdit数据集上表现优异，多跳问题准确率提升近2倍；在新数据集Controlled RippleEdit上，PropMEND在未见实体关系对中仍优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PropMEND在知识传播方面表现突出，但在未见关系上的性能差距缩小，未来需进一步优化广泛关系的知识传播。

Abstract: Knowledge editing techniques for large language models (LLMs) can inject
knowledge that is later reproducible verbatim, but they fall short on
propagating that knowledge: models cannot answer questions that require
reasoning with the injected knowledge. We present a hypernetwork-based approach
for knowledge propagation, named PropMEND, where we meta-learn how to modify
gradients of a language modeling loss to encourage injected information to
propagate. Our approach extends the meta-objective of MEND [29] so that
gradient updates on knowledge are transformed to enable answering multi-hop
questions involving that knowledge. We show improved performance on the
RippleEdit dataset, showing almost 2x accuracy on challenging multi-hop
questions whose answers are not explicitly stated in the injected fact. We
further introduce a new dataset, Controlled RippleEdit, to evaluate the
generalization of our hypernetwork, testing knowledge propagation along
relations and entities unseen during hypernetwork training. PropMEND still
outperforms existing approaches in unseen entity-relation pairs, yet the
performance gap decreases substantially, suggesting future work in propagating
knowledge to a wide range of relations.

Result: 实验表明，FaithfulRAG优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: FaithfulRAG有效解决了知识冲突问题，提升了生成响应的忠实性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) augmented with retrieval systems have
demonstrated significant potential in handling knowledge-intensive tasks.
However, these models often struggle with unfaithfulness issues, generating
outputs that either ignore the retrieved context or inconsistently blend it
with the LLM`s parametric knowledge. This issue is particularly severe in cases
of knowledge conflict, where the retrieved context conflicts with the model`s
parametric knowledge. While existing faithful RAG approaches enforce strict
context adherence through well-designed prompts or modified decoding
strategies, our analysis reveals a critical limitation: they achieve
faithfulness by forcibly suppressing the model`s parametric knowledge, which
undermines the model`s internal knowledge structure and increases the risk of
misinterpreting the context. To this end, this paper proposes FaithfulRAG, a
novel framework that resolves knowledge conflicts by explicitly modeling
discrepancies between the model`s parametric knowledge and retrieved context.
Specifically, FaithfulRAG identifies conflicting knowledge at the fact level
and designs a self-thinking process, allowing LLMs to reason about and
integrate conflicting facts before generating responses. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The code is

Method: 通过评估LLMs回答直接知识问题和引导性问题的能力，分析其是否主动纠正用户的错误信念，并结合其知识水平和政治偏见进行分析。

Result: 研究发现LLMs在建立对话基础和拒绝错误用户信念方面存在显著挑战。

Conclusion: LLMs在政治对话中减少错误信息的能力有限，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Communication among humans relies on conversational grounding, allowing
interlocutors to reach mutual understanding even when they do not have perfect

investigates how large language models (LLMs) manage common ground in cases
where they (don't) possess knowledge, focusing on facts in the political domain
where the risk of misinformation and grounding failure is high. We examine the
ability of LLMs to answer direct knowledge questions and loaded questions that
presuppose misinformation. We evaluate whether loaded questions lead LLMs to
engage in active grounding and correct false user beliefs, in connection to
their level of knowledge and their political bias. Our findings highlight
significant challenges in LLMs' ability to engage in grounding and reject false
user beliefs, raising concerns about their role in mitigating misinformation in

Result: 发现语言模型在预训练后能精确表示数字，且嵌入的精确性与算术错误显著相关。通过调整嵌入模式可以减轻这些错误。

Conclusion: 新探测技术揭示了语言模型对数字的精确表示能力，并提供了减少算术错误的方法。

Abstract: Pretrained language models (LMs) are prone to arithmetic errors. Existing
work showed limited success in probing numeric values from models'
representations, indicating that these errors can be attributed to the inherent
unreliability of distributionally learned embeddings in representing exact
quantities. However, we observe that previous probing methods are inadequate
for the emergent structure of learned number embeddings with sinusoidal
patterns.
  In response, we propose a novel probing technique that decodes numeric values
from input embeddings with near-perfect accuracy across a range of open-source
LMs. This proves that after the sole pre-training, LMs represent numbers with
remarkable precision. Finally, we find that the embeddings' preciseness judged
by our probe's accuracy explains a large portion of LM's errors in elementary
arithmetic, and show that aligning the embeddings with the pattern discovered
by our probe can mitigate these errors.

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by multimodal large language models have been
developed to facilitate task execution on mobile devices. However, prior work
has predominantly focused on atomic tasks -- such as shot-chain execution tasks
and single-screen grounding tasks -- while overlooking the generalization to
compositional tasks, which are indispensable for real-world applications. This
work introduces UI-NEXUS, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate mobile
agents on three categories of compositional operations: Simple Concatenation,
Context Transition, and Deep Dive. UI-NEXUS supports interactive evaluation in
20 fully controllable local utility app environments, as well as 30 online
Chinese and English service apps. It comprises 100 interactive task templates
with an average optimal step count of 14.05. Experimental results across a
range of mobile agents with agentic workflow or agent-as-a-model show that
UI-NEXUS presents significant challenges. Specifically, existing agents
generally struggle to balance performance and efficiency, exhibiting
representative failure modes such as under-execution, over-execution, and
attention drift, causing visible atomic-to-compositional generalization gap.
Inspired by these findings, we propose AGENT-NEXUS, a lightweight and efficient
scheduling system to tackle compositional mobile tasks. AGENT-NEXUS
extrapolates the abilities of existing mobile agents by dynamically decomposing
long-horizon tasks to a series of self-contained atomic subtasks. AGENT-NEXUS
achieves 24% to 40% task success rate improvement for existing mobile agents on
compositional operation tasks within the UI-NEXUS benchmark without
significantly sacrificing inference overhead. The demo video, dataset, and code
are available on the project page at https://ui-nexus.github.io.

the performance of an automatic speaker verification system, while the second
illustrates the articulatory patterns of one speaker in L1, L2, and a fake

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早期检测对预防和延缓神经认知障碍（NCD）的进展至关重要，而语言相关的fMRI可能是一种有前景的检测方法。

Method: 研究设计了一种自然语言相关的fMRI任务，并在97名非痴呆的中国香港老年人中测试其有效性，结合机器学习和人口统计学数据进行分类。

Result: 机器学习模型基于fMRI特征和人口统计学数据，分类认知状态的曲线下面积（AUC）达到0.86，特征主要来自语言处理相关脑区。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了自然语言相关fMRI任务在早期检测认知衰退和NCD中的潜力。

Abstract: Early detection is crucial for timely intervention aimed at preventing and
slowing the progression of neurocognitive disorder (NCD), a common and
significant health problem among the aging population. Recent evidence has
suggested that language-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
may be a promising approach for detecting cognitive decline and early NCD. In
this paper, we proposed a novel, naturalistic language-related fMRI task for
this purpose. We examined the effectiveness of this task among 97 non-demented
Chinese older adults from Hong Kong. The results showed that machine-learning
classification models based on fMRI features extracted from the task and
demographics (age, gender, and education year) achieved an average area under
the curve of 0.86 when classifying participants' cognitive status (labeled as
NORMAL vs DECLINE based on their scores on a standard neurcognitive test).
Feature localization revealed that the fMRI features most frequently selected
by the data-driven approach came primarily from brain regions associated with
language processing, such as the superior temporal gyrus, middle temporal
gyrus, and right cerebellum. The study demonstrated the potential of the
naturalistic language-related fMRI task for early detection of aging-related
cognitive decline and NCD.

Conclusion: SpeechMaturity数据集显著提升了儿童语音分类任务的性能，为未来研究提供了高质量资源。

Abstract: Speech technology systems struggle with many downstream tasks for child
speech due to small training corpora and the difficulties that child speech
pose. We apply a novel dataset, SpeechMaturity, to state-of-the-art transformer
models to address a fundamental classification task: identifying child
vocalizations. Unlike previous corpora, our dataset captures maximally
ecologically-valid child vocalizations across an unprecedented sample,
comprising children acquiring 25+ languages in the U.S., Bolivia, Vanuatu,
Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, and France. The dataset contains 242,004
labeled vocalizations, magnitudes larger than previous work. Models were
trained to distinguish between cry, laughter, mature (consonant+vowel), and
immature speech (just consonant or vowel). Models trained on the dataset
outperform state-of-the-art models trained on previous datasets, achieved
classification accuracy comparable to humans, and were robust across rural and
urban settings.

Conclusion: SWE-Flow为TDD研究提供了高效的数据合成方法，并公开了所有资源以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: We introduce **SWE-Flow**, a novel data synthesis framework grounded in
Test-Driven Development (TDD). Unlike existing software engineering data that
rely on human-submitted issues, **SWE-Flow** automatically infers incremental
development steps directly from unit tests, which inherently encapsulate
high-level requirements. The core of **SWE-Flow** is the construction of a
Runtime Dependency Graph (RDG), which precisely captures function interactions,
enabling the generation of a structured, step-by-step *development schedule*.
At each step, **SWE-Flow** produces a partial codebase, the corresponding unit
tests, and the necessary code modifications, resulting in fully verifiable TDD
tasks. With this approach, we generated 16,061 training instances and 2,020
test instances from real-world GitHub projects, creating the **SWE-Flow-Eval**
benchmark. Our experiments show that fine-tuning open model on this dataset
significantly improves performance in TDD-based coding. To facilitate further
research, we release all code, datasets, models, and Docker images at

Abstract: The present study extends recent work on Universal Dependencies annotations
for second-language (L2) Korean by introducing a semi-automated framework that
identifies morphosyntactic constructions from XPOS sequences and aligns those

L2-Korean corpus by annotating 2,998 new sentences from argumentative essays.
To evaluate the impact of XPOS-UPOS alignments, we fine-tune L2-Korean
morphosyntactic analysis models on datasets both with and without these

Conclusion: SSA通过分离生成答案和分析聚合样本的LLM，能够高效利用黑盒模型的输出，提升性能。

Abstract: Scaling test-time compute brings substantial performance gains for large
language models (LLMs). By sampling multiple answers and heuristically
aggregate their answers (e.g., either through majority voting or using
verifiers to rank the answers), one can achieve consistent performance gains in
math domains. In this paper, we propose a new way to leverage such multiple
sample set. We train a compact LLM, called Sample Set Aggregator (SSA), that
takes a concatenated sequence of multiple samples and output the final answer,
optimizing it for the answer accuracy with reinforcement learning. Experiments
on multiple reasoning datasets show that SSA outperforms other test-time
scaling methods such as reward model-based re-ranking. Our approach also shows
a promising generalization ability, across sample set sizes, base model
families and scales, and tasks. By separating LLMs to generate answers and LLMs
to analyze and aggregate sampled answers, our approach can work with the
outputs from premier black box models easily and efficiently.

Conclusion: LLM校对在词汇和句法上表现一致且生成性强，可能对提升写作连贯性有帮助。

Abstract: This study examines the lexical and syntactic interventions of human and LLM
proofreading aimed at improving overall intelligibility in identical second
language writings, and evaluates the consistency of outcomes across three LLMs
(ChatGPT-4o, Llama3.1-8b, Deepseek-r1-8b). Findings show that both human and
LLM proofreading enhance bigram lexical features, which may contribute to
better coherence and contextual connectedness between adjacent words. However,
LLM proofreading exhibits a more generative approach, extensively reworking
vocabulary and sentence structures, such as employing more diverse and
sophisticated vocabulary and incorporating a greater number of adjective
modifiers in noun phrases. The proofreading outcomes are highly consistent in
major lexical and syntactic features across the three models.

Conclusion: Router-R1通过强化学习框架有效解决了多LLM路由问题，为性能与成本权衡提供了新途径。

Abstract: The rapid emergence of diverse large language models (LLMs) has spurred the
development of LLM routers that assign user queries to the most suitable model.
However, existing LLM routers typically perform a single-round, one-to-one
mapping (\textit{i.e.}, assigning each query to a single model in isolation),
which limits their capability to tackle complex tasks that demand the
complementary strengths of multiple LLMs. In this paper, we present
\textbf{Router-R1}, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework that
formulates multi-LLM routing and aggregation as a sequential decision process.
Router-R1 instantiates the router itself as a capable LLM, leveraging its
reasoning ability to interleave "think" actions (internal deliberation) with
"route" actions (dynamic model invocation), and integrates each response into
its evolving context. To guide learning, we employ a lightweight rule-based
reward comprising format rewards, final outcome rewards, and a novel cost
reward for performance and cost trade-off optimization, opening a pathway
toward optimizing performance-cost tradeoffs via RL. Router-R1 also conditions
only on simple model descriptors such as pricing, latency, and example
performance, enabling strong generalization to unseen model selection.
Experiments on seven general and multi-hop QA benchmarks show that Router-R1
outperforms over several strong baselines, achieving superior performance while
maintaining robust generalization and cost management.Code is available at

Conclusion: 研究揭示了多模态性能差距的原因，并提出了一种无需训练的改进方法。

Abstract: Vision-Language models (VLMs) show impressive abilities to answer questions
on visual inputs (e.g., counting objects in an image), yet demonstrate higher
accuracies when performing an analogous task on text (e.g., counting words in a
text). We investigate this accuracy gap by identifying and comparing the
\textit{circuits} - the task-specific computational sub-graphs - in different
modalities. We show that while circuits are largely disjoint between
modalities, they implement relatively similar functionalities: the differences
lie primarily in processing modality-specific data positions (an image or a
text sequence). Zooming in on the image data representations, we observe they
become aligned with the higher-performing analogous textual representations
only towards later layers, too late in processing to effectively influence
subsequent positions. To overcome this, we patch the representations of visual
data tokens from later layers back into earlier layers. In experiments with
multiple tasks and models, this simple intervention closes a third of the
performance gap between the modalities, on average. Our analysis sheds light on
the multi-modal performance gap in VLMs and suggests a training-free approach
for reducing it.

Method: 开发数据驱动的生物力学算法，引入人机交互机制，允许外科医生动态修正模型。

Result: 算法平均目标配准误差为3.42 mm，结合交互机制后降至2.78 mm，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了高效准确的变形建模，增强了外科医生与算法的协作，为计算机辅助手术提供了更安全可靠的方案。

Abstract: In augmented reality (AR)-guided surgical navigation, preoperative organ
models are superimposed onto the patient's intraoperative anatomy to visualize
critical structures such as vessels and tumors. Accurate deformation modeling
is essential to maintain the reliability of AR overlays by ensuring alignment
between preoperative models and the dynamically changing anatomy. Although the
finite element method (FEM) offers physically plausible modeling, its high
computational cost limits intraoperative applicability. Moreover, existing
algorithms often fail to handle large anatomical changes, such as those induced
by pneumoperitoneum or ligament dissection, leading to inaccurate anatomical
correspondences and compromised AR guidance. To address these challenges, we
propose a data-driven biomechanics algorithm that preserves FEM-level accuracy
while improving computational efficiency. In addition, we introduce a novel
human-in-the-loop mechanism into the deformation modeling process. This enables
surgeons to interactively provide prompts to correct anatomical misalignments,
thereby incorporating clinical expertise and allowing the model to adapt
dynamically to complex surgical scenarios. Experiments on a publicly available
dataset demonstrate that our algorithm achieves a mean target registration
error of 3.42 mm. Incorporating surgeon prompts through the interactive
framework further reduces the error to 2.78 mm, surpassing state-of-the-art
methods in volumetric accuracy. These results highlight the ability of our
framework to deliver efficient and accurate deformation modeling while
enhancing surgeon-algorithm collaboration, paving the way for safer and more
reliable computer-assisted surgeries.

Conclusion: ReCogDrive通过多阶段训练和强化学习，显著提升了自动驾驶在复杂场景中的性能。

Abstract: Although end-to-end autonomous driving has made remarkable progress, its
performance degrades significantly in rare and long-tail scenarios. Recent
approaches attempt to address this challenge by leveraging the rich world
knowledge of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), but these methods suffer from
several limitations: (1) a significant domain gap between the pre-training data
of VLMs and real-world driving data, (2) a dimensionality mismatch between the
discrete language space and the continuous action space, and (3) imitation
learning tends to capture the average behavior present in the dataset, which
may be suboptimal even dangerous. In this paper, we propose ReCogDrive, an
autonomous driving system that integrates VLMs with diffusion planner, which
adopts a three-stage paradigm for training. In the first stage, we use a
large-scale driving question-answering datasets to train the VLMs, mitigating
the domain discrepancy between generic content and real-world driving
scenarios. In the second stage, we employ a diffusion-based planner to perform
imitation learning, mapping representations from the latent language space to
continuous driving actions. Finally, we fine-tune the diffusion planner using
reinforcement learning with NAVSIM non-reactive simulator, enabling the model
to generate safer, more human-like driving trajectories. We evaluate our
approach on the planning-oriented NAVSIM benchmark, achieving a PDMS of 89.6
and setting a new state-of-the-art that surpasses the previous vision-only SOTA
by 5.6 PDMS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前T2I系统的训练数据偏向欧美文化，忽视了全球南方的文化多样性，CuRe旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 利用维基媒体知识图谱构建了一个包含300个文化实体的数据集，分为6个文化轴，通过分析T2I系统对文本条件变化的响应进行评估。

Result: CuRe评分器与人类对感知相似性、图像-文本对齐和文化多样性的判断高度相关，适用于多种图像编码器和T2I系统。

Conclusion: CuRe为T2I系统的文化代表性提供了可扩展的评估工具，有助于减少文化偏见。

Abstract: Popular text-to-image (T2I) systems are trained on web-scraped data, which is
heavily Amero and Euro-centric, underrepresenting the cultures of the Global
South. To analyze these biases, we introduce CuRe, a novel and scalable
benchmarking and scoring suite for cultural representativeness that leverages
the marginal utility of attribute specification to T2I systems as a proxy for
human judgments. Our CuRe benchmark dataset has a novel categorical hierarchy
built from the crowdsourced Wikimedia knowledge graph, with 300 cultural
artifacts across 32 cultural subcategories grouped into six broad cultural axes
(food, art, fashion, architecture, celebrations, and people). Our dataset's
categorical hierarchy enables CuRe scorers to evaluate T2I systems by analyzing
their response to increasing the informativeness of text conditioning, enabling
fine-grained cultural comparisons. We empirically observe much stronger
correlations of our class of scorers to human judgments of perceptual
similarity, image-text alignment, and cultural diversity across image encoders
(SigLIP 2, AIMV2 and DINOv2), vision-language models (OpenCLIP, SigLIP 2,
Gemini 2.0 Flash) and state-of-the-art text-to-image systems, including three
variants of Stable Diffusion (1.5, XL, 3.5 Large), FLUX.1 [dev], Ideogram 2.0,

Abstract: Accurate canal network mapping is essential for water management, including
irrigation planning and infrastructure maintenance. State-of-the-art semantic
segmentation models for infrastructure mapping, such as roads, rely on large,
well-annotated remote sensing datasets. However, incomplete or inadequate
ground truth can hinder these learning approaches. Many infrastructure networks
have graph-level properties such as reachability to a source (like canals) or
connectivity (roads) that can be leveraged to improve these existing ground
truth. This paper develops a novel iterative framework IGraSS, combining a
semantic segmentation module-incorporating RGB and additional modalities (NDWI,
DEM)-with a graph-based ground-truth refinement module. The segmentation module
processes satellite imagery patches, while the refinement module operates on
the entire data viewing the infrastructure network as a graph. Experiments show
that IGraSS reduces unreachable canal segments from around 18% to 3%, and
training with refined ground truth significantly improves canal identification.
IGraSS serves as a robust framework for both refining noisy ground truth and
mapping canal networks from remote sensing imagery. We also demonstrate the
effectiveness and generalizability of IGraSS using road networks as an example,
applying a different graph-theoretic constraint to complete road networks.

*Harshvardhan Takawale,Nirupam Roy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpINRv2是一个基于神经网络的框架，用于通过FMCW雷达实现高保真体积重建。相比前作SpINR，该版本在高起始频率下更准确地学习，解决了相位混叠和子区间模糊问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高起始频率下，雷达信号的相位混叠和子区间模糊问题显著，需要一种更精确的建模方法。

Method: 提出了一种完全可微的频率域前向模型，结合隐式神经表示（INR）进行连续体积场景建模，并引入稀疏性和平滑性正则化以消除子区间模糊。

Result: 实验表明，SpINRv2在高频条件下显著优于经典和基于学习的方法，为神经雷达3D成像设立了新基准。

Conclusion: SpINRv2通过频率域建模和正则化技术，在高频雷达信号处理中实现了更高的精度和效率。

Abstract: We present SpINRv2, a neural framework for high-fidelity volumetric
reconstruction using Frequency-Modulated Continuous-Wave (FMCW) radar.
Extending our prior work (SpINR), this version introduces enhancements that
allow accurate learning under high start frequencies-where phase aliasing and
sub-bin ambiguity become prominent. Our core contribution is a fully
differentiable frequency-domain forward model that captures the complex radar
response using closed-form synthesis, paired with an implicit neural
representation (INR) for continuous volumetric scene modeling. Unlike
time-domain baselines, SpINRv2 directly supervises the complex frequency
spectrum, preserving spectral fidelity while drastically reducing computational
overhead. Additionally, we introduce sparsity and smoothness regularization to
disambiguate sub-bin ambiguities that arise at fine range resolutions.
Experimental results show that SpINRv2 significantly outperforms both classical
and learning-based baselines, especially under high-frequency regimes,
establishing a new benchmark for neural radar-based 3D imaging.

*Huixin Zhan,Jason H. Moore*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于离散扩散框架和视觉-语言-动作（VLA）管道的方法，用于建模外科医生的个性化操作风格，同时关注隐私保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI系统常忽略外科医生的个性化操作风格，而本文旨在通过多模态输入（如视频、手术意图语言等）建模这种个性化信号。

Method: 采用离散扩散框架，结合VLA管道，将手势预测建模为结构化序列去噪任务，并通过自然语言提示编码个性化风格。

Result: 在JIGSAWS数据集上验证了方法的有效性，能够准确重建手势序列并学习到独特的外科医生运动指纹，但发现个性化嵌入会增加身份泄露风险。

Conclusion: 个性化嵌入虽提升性能，但也增加隐私风险，需在手术建模中平衡个性化与隐私保护。

Abstract: Surgeons exhibit distinct operating styles due to differences in training,
experience, and motor behavior - yet current AI systems often ignore this
personalization signal. We propose a novel approach to model fine-grained,
surgeon-specific fingerprinting in robotic surgery using a discrete diffusion
framework integrated with a vision-language-action (VLA) pipeline. Our method
formulates gesture prediction as a structured sequence denoising task,
conditioned on multimodal inputs including endoscopic video, surgical intent
language, and a privacy-aware embedding of surgeon identity and skill.
Personalized surgeon fingerprinting is encoded through natural language prompts
using third-party language models, allowing the model to retain individual
behavioral style without exposing explicit identity. We evaluate our method on
the JIGSAWS dataset and demonstrate that it accurately reconstructs gesture
sequences while learning meaningful motion fingerprints unique to each surgeon.
To quantify the privacy implications of personalization, we perform membership
inference attacks and find that more expressive embeddings improve task
performance but simultaneously increase susceptibility to identity leakage.
These findings demonstrate that while personalized embeddings improve
performance, they also increase vulnerability to identity leakage, revealing
the importance of balancing personalization with privacy risk in surgical
modeling. Code is available at:

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无需训练的开放世界场景图生成（Open-World SGG）框架，利用预训练视觉语言模型（VLM）实现零样本推理，适用于未见过的对象和关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖数据集特定监督或微调，限制了在开放世界中的适用性。本文旨在利用预训练VLM的知识，实现无需额外学习的场景图生成。

Method: 通过多模态提示、嵌入对齐和轻量级对优化策略，将SGG问题转化为零样本结构化推理任务。

Result: 在Visual Genome、Open Images V6和PSG数据集上的实验表明，预训练VLM无需任务级训练即可实现关系理解。

Conclusion: Open-World SGG框架展示了预训练VLM在开放世界场景图生成中的潜力，为无需监督的关系理解提供了新思路。

Abstract: Scene-Graph Generation (SGG) seeks to recognize objects in an image and
distill their salient pairwise relationships. Most methods depend on
dataset-specific supervision to learn the variety of interactions, restricting
their usefulness in open-world settings, involving novel objects and/or
relations. Even methods that leverage large Vision Language Models (VLMs)
typically require benchmark-specific fine-tuning. We introduce Open-World SGG,
a training-free, efficient, model-agnostic framework that taps directly into
the pretrained knowledge of VLMs to produce scene graphs with zero additional
learning. Casting SGG as a zero-shot structured-reasoning problem, our method
combines multimodal prompting, embedding alignment, and a lightweight
pair-refinement strategy, enabling inference over unseen object vocabularies
and relation sets. To assess this setting, we formalize an Open-World
evaluation protocol that measures performance when no SGG-specific data have
been observed either in terms of objects and relations. Experiments on Visual
Genome, Open Images V6, and the Panoptic Scene Graph (PSG) dataset demonstrate
the capacity of pretrained VLMs to perform relational understanding without
task-level training.

TL;DR: 该研究扩展了DVP（视觉先验解耦器）架构，使其能处理场景中的多个对象，并通过改进训练模式和损失函数提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决原始DVP无法处理多对象场景的问题，并利用其潜在空间的可解释性优化训练过程。

Method: 扩展DVP以支持多对象场景，利用解码器生成额外训练样本，并在潜在空间定义损失函数以改进训练。

Result: 新方法在重建质量和对象分解能力上优于基线模型（MONet和LIVE），并提出了新的基准数据集。

Conclusion: 研究表明，潜在空间损失函数能有效解决训练中的平台问题，但可微分渲染在自编码器中仍有局限性。

Abstract: This study builds on the architecture of the Disentangler of Visual Priors
(DVP), a type of autoencoder that learns to interpret scenes by decomposing the
perceived objects into independent visual aspects of shape, size, orientation,
and color appearance. These aspects are expressed as latent parameters which
control a differentiable renderer that performs image reconstruction, so that
the model can be trained end-to-end with gradient using reconstruction loss. In
this study, we extend the original DVP so that it can handle multiple objects
in a scene. We also exploit the interpretability of its latent by using the
decoder to sample additional training examples and devising alternative
training modes that rely on loss functions defined not only in the image space,
but also in the latent space. This significantly facilitates training, which is
otherwise challenging due to the presence of extensive plateaus in the
image-space reconstruction loss. To examine the performance of this approach,
we propose a new benchmark featuring multiple 2D objects, which subsumes the
previously proposed Multi-dSprites dataset while being more parameterizable. We
compare the DVP extended in these ways with two baselines (MONet and LIVE) and
demonstrate its superiority in terms of reconstruction quality and capacity to
decompose overlapping objects. We also analyze the gradients induced by the
considered loss functions, explain how they impact the efficacy of training,
and discuss the limitations of differentiable rendering in autoencoders and the
ways in which they can be addressed.

Motivation: 现有单目3D重建方法和视觉语言模型在标准基准上表现优异，但其对几何属性的真实理解尚不明确。

Method: GIQ包含合成和真实世界的224种多面体图像，涵盖不同复杂度和对称性，通过多种实验评估模型能力。

Result: 当前模型在基本几何形状重建、对称性检测和复杂几何区分任务中表现不佳，视觉语言助手对多面体理解准确率低。

Conclusion: GIQ为未来几何智能研究提供了结构化平台，促进几何感知表示学习的进步。

Abstract: Monocular 3D reconstruction methods and vision-language models (VLMs)
demonstrate impressive results on standard benchmarks, yet their true
understanding of geometric properties remains unclear. We introduce GIQ , a
comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the geometric
reasoning capabilities of vision and vision-language foundation models. GIQ
comprises synthetic and real-world images of 224 diverse polyhedra - including
Platonic, Archimedean, Johnson, and Catalan solids, as well as stellations and
compound shapes - covering varying levels of complexity and symmetry. Through
systematic experiments involving monocular 3D reconstruction, 3D symmetry
detection, mental rotation tests, and zero-shot shape classification tasks, we
reveal significant shortcomings in current models. State-of-the-art
reconstruction algorithms trained on extensive 3D datasets struggle to
reconstruct even basic geometric forms accurately. While foundation models
effectively detect specific 3D symmetry elements via linear probing, they
falter significantly in tasks requiring detailed geometric differentiation,
such as mental rotation. Moreover, advanced vision-language assistants exhibit
remarkably low accuracy on complex polyhedra, systematically misinterpreting
basic properties like face geometry, convexity, and compound structures. GIQ is
publicly available, providing a structured platform to highlight and address
critical gaps in geometric intelligence, facilitating future progress in
robust, geometry-aware representation learning.

Motivation: 当前文本到图像模型仍使用过时的T5和CLIP作为文本编码器，研究旨在评估现代LLM的潜力。

Method: 构建标准化训练与评估流程，训练27个模型，比较12种文本编码器，分析嵌入提取方法、LLM变体和模型大小的影响。

Result: 发现传统最后一层嵌入效果较差，而层归一化平均嵌入显著提升复杂提示的对齐能力，多数LLM表现优于T5基线。

Conclusion: 现代LLM作为文本编码器在文本到图像生成中具有优势，尤其在高级视觉语言推理任务中表现更佳。

Abstract: Both text-to-image generation and large language models (LLMs) have made
significant advancements. However, many text-to-image models still employ the
somewhat outdated T5 and CLIP as their text encoders. In this work, we
investigate the effectiveness of using modern decoder-only LLMs as text
encoders for text-to-image diffusion models. We build a standardized training
and evaluation pipeline that allows us to isolate and evaluate the effect of
different text embeddings. We train a total of 27 text-to-image models with 12
different text encoders to analyze the critical aspects of LLMs that could
impact text-to-image generation, including the approaches to extract
embeddings, different LLMs variants, and model sizes. Our experiments reveal
that the de facto way of using last-layer embeddings as conditioning leads to
inferior performance. Instead, we explore embeddings from various layers and
find that using layer-normalized averaging across all layers significantly
improves alignment with complex prompts. Most LLMs with this conditioning
outperform the baseline T5 model, showing enhanced performance in advanced
visio-linguistic reasoning skills.

Result: 与全监督模型相比，自监督集成模型在测试集上的IOU指标提升了0.02。

Conclusion: 自监督方法在湿地监测中具有潜力，能够减少对标注数据的依赖并提升性能。

Abstract: In recent years the wide availability of high-resolution radar satellite
images along with the advancement of computer vision models have enabled the
remote monitoring of the surface area of wetlands. However, these models
require large amounts of manually annotated satellite images, which are slow
and expensive to produce. To overcome this problem, self-supervised training
methods have been deployed to train models without using annotated data. In
this paper we use a combination of deep clustering and negative sampling to
train a model to segment radar satellite images into areas that separate water
from land without the use of any manual annotations. Furthermore, we implement
an ensemble version of the model to reduce variance and improve performance.
Compared to a single fully-supervised model using the same architecture, our
ensemble of self-supervised models achieves a 0.02 improvement in the
Intersection Over Union metric over our test dataset.

Conclusion: 该方法通过学习密集对应关系，显著提升了语义对应的泛化能力，同时展示了无监督方法的潜力。

Abstract: Semantic correspondence (SC) aims to establish semantically meaningful
matches across different instances of an object category. We illustrate how
recent supervised SC methods remain limited in their ability to generalize
beyond sparsely annotated training keypoints, effectively acting as keypoint
detectors. To address this, we propose a novel approach for learning dense
correspondences by lifting 2D keypoints into a canonical 3D space using
monocular depth estimation. Our method constructs a continuous canonical
manifold that captures object geometry without requiring explicit 3D
supervision or camera annotations. Additionally, we introduce SPair-U, an
extension of SPair-71k with novel keypoint annotations, to better assess
generalization. Experiments not only demonstrate that our model significantly
outperforms supervised baselines on unseen keypoints, highlighting its
effectiveness in learning robust correspondences, but that unsupervised
baselines outperform supervised counterparts when generalized across different
datasets.

Motivation: 研究旨在揭示现有视觉语言组合理解基准的设计缺陷，尤其是数据来源和构建过程中的偏见，以改进评估方法。

Method: 通过分析17个常用基准（如SugarCREPE、VALSE）的设计选择（如数据来源、负样本构建），识别其内在偏见，并验证简单启发式方法的性能。

Result: 发现基准的构建导致正负样本分布不对称，使简单启发式方法（如词长、语言模型对数似然）与CLIP模型表现相当，表明基准未能有效衡量组合理解能力。

Conclusion: 提出了构建更鲁棒的视觉语言组合理解基准的建议，以减少设计偏见和简单攻击的影响。

Abstract: We investigate 17 benchmarks (e.g. SugarCREPE, VALSE) commonly used for
measuring compositional understanding capabilities of vision-language models
(VLMs). We scrutinize design choices in their construction, including data
source (e.g. MS-COCO) and curation procedures (e.g. constructing negative
images/captions), uncovering several inherent biases across most benchmarks. We
find that blind heuristics (e.g. token-length, log-likelihood under a language
model) perform on par with CLIP models, indicating that these benchmarks do not
effectively measure compositional understanding. We demonstrate that the
underlying factor is a distribution asymmetry between positive and negative
images/captions, induced by the benchmark construction procedures. To mitigate
these issues, we provide a few key recommendations for constructing more robust
vision-language compositional understanding benchmarks, that would be less
prone to such simple attacks.

Result: 展示了在修复和文本引导编辑任务中的多样性和真实性，无需训练生成模型。

Conclusion: 1D分词器在高效压缩下仍能实现精细的图像操作和生成，为图像处理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Commonly used image tokenizers produce a 2D grid of spatially arranged
tokens. In contrast, so-called 1D image tokenizers represent images as highly
compressed one-dimensional sequences of as few as 32 discrete tokens. We find
that the high degree of compression achieved by a 1D tokenizer with vector
quantization enables image editing and generative capabilities through
heuristic manipulation of tokens, demonstrating that even very crude
manipulations -- such as copying and replacing tokens between latent
representations of images -- enable fine-grained image editing by transferring
appearance and semantic attributes. Motivated by the expressivity of the 1D
tokenizer's latent space, we construct an image generation pipeline leveraging
gradient-based test-time optimization of tokens with plug-and-play loss
functions such as reconstruction or CLIP similarity. Our approach is
demonstrated for inpainting and text-guided image editing use cases, and can
generate diverse and realistic samples without requiring training of any
generative model.

TL;DR: Mirage是一个音频到视频的基础模型，能够根据音频输入生成逼真、富有表现力的视频内容，尤其擅长生成人物说话的A-roll视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频生成方法要么忽略音频专注于无声图像序列生成，要么局限于特定应用领域（如重新配音）。Mirage旨在解决这一问题，实现音频与视频的和谐集成。

Method: Mirage采用基于自注意力的统一训练方法，支持从头训练或基于现有权重训练，无需依赖特定音频架构或损失组件。

Result: Mirage生成的视频在主观质量上优于其他方法，能够逼真地表现音频中的隐含表演。

Conclusion: Mirage为音频到视频生成提供了一种通用且高质量的方法，尤其在人物说话视频生成方面表现出色。

Abstract: From professional filmmaking to user-generated content, creators and
consumers have long recognized that the power of video depends on the
harmonious integration of what we hear (the video's audio track) with what we
see (the video's image sequence). Current approaches to video generation either
ignore sound to focus on general-purpose but silent image sequence generation
or address both visual and audio elements but focus on restricted application
domains such as re-dubbing. We introduce Mirage, an audio-to-video foundation
model that excels at generating realistic, expressive output imagery from
scratch given an audio input. When integrated with existing methods for speech
synthesis (text-to-speech, or TTS), Mirage results in compelling multimodal
video. When trained on audio-video footage of people talking (A-roll) and
conditioned on audio containing speech, Mirage generates video of people
delivering a believable interpretation of the performance implicit in input
audio. Our central technical contribution is a unified method for training
self-attention-based audio-to-video generation models, either from scratch or
given existing weights. This methodology allows Mirage to retain generality as
an approach to audio-to-video generation while producing outputs of superior
subjective quality to methods that incorporate audio-specific architectures or
loss components specific to people, speech, or details of how images or audio
are captured. We encourage readers to watch and listen to the results of Mirage
for themselves (see paper and comments for links).

Result: 在Imagenet-1k上，SEMA在更大规模的图像上表现优于线性注意力和近期视觉Mamba模型。

Conclusion: SEMA是一种可扩展且高效的注意力替代方案，适用于大规模视觉任务。

Abstract: Attention is the critical component of a transformer. Yet the quadratic
computational complexity of vanilla full attention in the input size and the
inability of its linear attention variant to focus have been challenges for
computer vision tasks. We provide a mathematical definition of generalized
attention and formulate both vanilla softmax attention and linear attention
within the general framework. We prove that generalized attention disperses,
that is, as the number of keys tends to infinity, the query assigns equal
weights to all keys. Motivated by the dispersion property and recent
development of Mamba form of attention, we design Scalable and Efficient Mamba
like Attention (SEMA) which utilizes token localization to avoid dispersion and
maintain focusing, complemented by theoretically consistent arithmetic
averaging to capture global aspect of attention. We support our approach on
Imagenet-1k where classification results show that SEMA is a scalable and
effective alternative beyond linear attention, outperforming recent vision
Mamba models on increasingly larger scales of images at similar model parameter
sizes.

Abstract: Deep neural networks face several challenges in hyperspectral image
classification, including high-dimensional data, sparse distribution of ground
objects, and spectral redundancy, which often lead to classification
overfitting and limited generalization capability. To more effectively extract
and fuse spatial context with fine spectral information in hyperspectral image
(HSI) classification, this paper proposes a novel network architecture called
STNet. The core advantage of STNet stems from the dual innovative design of its
Spatial-Spectral Transformer module: first, the fundamental explicit decoupling
of spatial and spectral attention ensures targeted capture of key information
in HSI; second, two functionally distinct gating mechanisms perform intelligent
regulation at both the fusion level of attention flows (adaptive attention
fusion gating) and the internal level of feature transformation (GFFN). This
characteristic demonstrates superior feature extraction and fusion capabilities
compared to traditional convolutional neural networks, while reducing
overfitting risks in small-sample and high-noise scenarios. STNet enhances
model representation capability without increasing network depth or width. The
proposed method demonstrates superior performance on IN, UP, and KSC datasets,
outperforming mainstream hyperspectral image classification approaches.

Abstract: In racket sports, such as tennis, locating the ball's position at impact is
important in clarifying player and equipment characteristics, thereby aiding in
personalized equipment design. High-speed cameras are used to measure the
impact location; however, their excessive memory consumption limits prolonged
scene capture, and manual digitization for position detection is time-consuming
and prone to human error. These limitations make it difficult to effectively
capture the entire playing scene, hindering the ability to analyze the player's
performance. We propose a method for locating the tennis ball impact on the
racket in real time using an event camera. Event cameras efficiently measure
brightness changes (called `events') with microsecond accuracy under high-speed
motion while using lower memory consumption. These cameras enable users to
continuously monitor their performance over extended periods. Our method
consists of three identification steps: time range of swing, timing at impact,

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Step AG的自适应引导策略，通过限制分类器自由引导在前几个去噪步骤中使用，显著提升了生成速度（20%-30%），同时保持图像质量和文本对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前分类器自由引导方法在文本到视觉生成扩散模型中成本较高，需要两倍步骤，且现有自适应引导方法缺乏分析和普适性。

Method: 提出Step AG策略，将分类器自由引导限制在前几个去噪步骤中，适用于多种扩散模型。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在图像质量、文本对齐和生成速度（20%-30%提升）上表现优越，且适用于不同模型和设置。

Conclusion: Step AG是一种简单、普适的自适应引导策略，显著提升了生成效率，适用于广泛的扩散模型。

Abstract: With the rapid development of text-to-vision generation diffusion models,
classifier-free guidance has emerged as the most prevalent method for
conditioning. However, this approach inherently requires twice as many steps
for model forwarding compared to unconditional generation, resulting in
significantly higher costs. While previous study has introduced the concept of
adaptive guidance, it lacks solid analysis and empirical results, making
previous method unable to be applied to general diffusion models. In this work,
we present another perspective of applying adaptive guidance and propose Step
AG, which is a simple, universally applicable adaptive guidance strategy. Our
evaluations focus on both image quality and image-text alignment. whose results
indicate that restricting classifier-free guidance to the first several
denoising steps is sufficient for generating high-quality, well-conditioned
images, achieving an average speedup of 20% to 30%. Such improvement is
consistent across different settings such as inference steps, and various
models including video generation models, highlighting the superiority of our
method.

Motivation: 现有医学视觉语言框架采用统一的局部特征提取策略，忽视了模态特异性需求。

Method: MedMoE基于Swin Transformer提取多尺度特征，通过MoE模块动态路由到模态专家分支，实现空间自适应注意力。

Result: 在多个医学基准测试中，MedMoE显著提升了跨模态对齐和检索性能。

Conclusion: MedMoE证明了模态专用视觉表示在临床视觉语言系统中的价值。

Abstract: Different medical imaging modalities capture diagnostic information at
varying spatial resolutions, from coarse global patterns to fine-grained
localized structures. However, most existing vision-language frameworks in the
medical domain apply a uniform strategy for local feature extraction,
overlooking the modality-specific demands. In this work, we present MedMoE, a
modular and extensible vision-language processing framework that dynamically
adapts visual representation based on the diagnostic context. MedMoE
incorporates a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) module conditioned on the report type,
which routes multi-scale image features through specialized expert branches
trained to capture modality-specific visual semantics. These experts operate
over feature pyramids derived from a Swin Transformer backbone, enabling
spatially adaptive attention to clinically relevant regions. This framework
produces localized visual representations aligned with textual descriptions,
without requiring modality-specific supervision at inference. Empirical results
on diverse medical benchmarks demonstrate that MedMoE improves alignment and
retrieval performance across imaging modalities, underscoring the value of
modality-specialized visual representations in clinical vision-language
systems.

Motivation: 现代智能手机通常配备双摄像头，且超广角图像在广角图像出现摩尔纹时能提供正常颜色和纹理。

Method: 提出轻量级UW图像编码器和快速两阶段图像对齐方式，集成到现有去摩尔纹网络中。

Result: 在包含约9,000个样本的真实数据集上实验，效果优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DCID方法在去除大范围摩尔纹方面表现优异，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: When shooting electronic screens, moir\'e patterns usually appear in captured
images, which seriously affects the image quality. Existing image demoir\'eing
methods face great challenges in removing large and heavy moir\'e. To address
the issue, we propose to utilize Dual Camera fusion for Image Demoir\'eing
(DCID), \ie, using the ultra-wide-angle (UW) image to assist the moir\'e
removal of wide-angle (W) image. This is inspired by two motivations: (1) the
two lenses are commonly equipped with modern smartphones, (2) the UW image
generally can provide normal colors and textures when moir\'e exists in the W
image mainly due to their different focal lengths. In particular, we propose an
efficient DCID method, where a lightweight UW image encoder is integrated into
an existing demoir\'eing network and a fast two-stage image alignment manner is
present. Moreover, we construct a large-scale real-world dataset with diverse
mobile phones and monitors, containing about 9,000 samples. Experiments on the
dataset show our method performs better than state-of-the-art methods. Code and
dataset are available at https://github.com/Mrduckk/DCID.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), the

critical challenge to achieving accurate visual understanding. To address this

progressively selects and integrates multi-scale visual information,
facilitating a more precise interpretation of images. By contrasting these
visual information iteratively, SECOND significantly reduces perceptual

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以结合无线电地图的物理特性，导致稀疏样本下的密集地图估计效果不佳。

Method: 将无线电地图估计问题转化为稀疏信号恢复问题，结合物理传播模型分解为多个子问题，提出RadioDUN和DRM模块，并引入阴影损失。

Result: 实验表明，该方法优于现有技术。

Conclusion: RadioDUN通过结合物理特性和自适应学习，显著提升了无线电地图估计的准确性。

Abstract: The radio map represents the spatial distribution of spectrum resources
within a region, supporting efficient resource allocation and interference
mitigation. However, it is difficult to construct a dense radio map as a
limited number of samples can be measured in practical scenarios. While
existing works have used deep learning to estimate dense radio maps from sparse
samples, they are hard to integrate with the physical characteristics of the
radio map. To address this challenge, we cast radio map estimation as the
sparse signal recovery problem. A physical propagation model is further
incorporated to decompose the problem into multiple factor optimization
sub-problems, thereby reducing recovery complexity. Inspired by the existing
compressive sensing methods, we propose the Radio Deep Unfolding Network
(RadioDUN) to unfold the optimization process, achieving adaptive parameter
adjusting and prior fitting in a learnable manner. To account for the radio
propagation characteristics, we develop a dynamic reweighting module (DRM) to
adaptively model the importance of each factor for the radio map. Inspired by
the shadowing factor in the physical propagation model, we integrate
obstacle-related factors to express the obstacle-induced signal stochastic
decay. The shadowing loss is further designed to constrain the factor
prediction and act as a supplementary supervised objective, which enhances the
performance of RadioDUN. Extensive experiments have been conducted to
demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.
Our code will be made publicly available upon publication.

TL;DR: SCALE提出了一种基于数据质量的选择管道，用于提升视觉语言模型的指令调优数据集质量，解决了图像与文本对齐噪声和文本模糊的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型的效果依赖于高质量数据集，但现有数据存在图像与文本对齐噪声和文本模糊的问题，影响了模型的准确性和鲁棒性。

Method: SCALE通过跨模态评估框架，为每个数据条目分配任务并生成多类型描述，评估对齐性、清晰度、任务稀有性、文本连贯性和图像清晰度。

Result: 研究发现，现有单模态质量评估方法低估了特定任务所需样本，而生成的图像描述能有效将多模态任务转化为统一文本模态。

Conclusion: SCALE通过数据质量驱动的选择方法，提升了视觉语言模型的性能，为多模态任务提供了更高效的数据处理方案。

Abstract: The application of visual instruction tuning and other post-training
techniques has significantly enhanced the capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs) in visual understanding, enriching Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with
more comprehensive visual language datasets. However, the effectiveness of VLMs
is highly dependent on large-scale, high-quality datasets that ensure precise
recognition and accurate reasoning. Two key challenges hinder progress: (1)
noisy alignments between images and the corresponding text, which leads to
misinterpretation, and (2) ambiguous or misleading text, which obscures visual
content. To address these challenges, we propose SCALE (Single modality data
quality and Cross modality Alignment Evaluation), a novel quality-driven data
selection pipeline for VLM instruction tuning datasets. Specifically, SCALE
integrates a cross-modality assessment framework that first assigns each data
entry to its appropriate vision-language task, generates general and
task-specific captions (covering scenes, objects, style, etc.), and evaluates
the alignment, clarity, task rarity, text coherence, and image clarity of each
entry based on the generated captions. We reveal that: (1) current unimodal
quality assessment methods evaluate one modality while overlooking the rest,
which can underestimate samples essential for specific tasks and discard the
lower-quality instances that help build model robustness; and (2) appropriately
generated image captions provide an efficient way to transfer the image-text
multimodal task into a unified text modality.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自适应低通引导（ALG）方法，用于改善图像到视频（I2V）生成模型的动态性，避免静态视频问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的I2V生成模型在微调预训练文本到视频（T2V）模型时，常导致生成的视频动态性不足，显得过于静态。

Method: 通过自适应低通引导（ALG），在去噪的早期阶段对输入图像进行低通滤波，以平衡动态性和图像质量。

Result: 实验表明，ALG显著提升了生成视频的动态性（VBench-I2V测试中动态度平均提升36%），同时保持了图像质量和文本对齐。

Conclusion: ALG是一种简单有效的解决方案，能够在不牺牲图像质量的前提下，显著提升I2V生成模型的动态性。

Abstract: Recent text-to-video (T2V) models have demonstrated strong capabilities in
producing high-quality, dynamic videos. To improve the visual controllability,
recent works have considered fine-tuning pre-trained T2V models to support
image-to-video (I2V) generation. However, such adaptation frequently suppresses
motion dynamics of generated outputs, resulting in more static videos compared
to their T2V counterparts. In this work, we analyze this phenomenon and
identify that it stems from the premature exposure to high-frequency details in
the input image, which biases the sampling process toward a shortcut trajectory
that overfits to the static appearance of the reference image. To address this,
we propose adaptive low-pass guidance (ALG), a simple fix to the I2V model
sampling procedure to generate more dynamic videos without compromising
per-frame image quality. Specifically, ALG adaptively modulates the frequency
content of the conditioning image by applying low-pass filtering at the early
stage of denoising. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ALG significantly
improves the temporal dynamics of generated videos, while preserving image
fidelity and text alignment. Especially, under VBench-I2V test suite, ALG
achieves an average improvement of 36% in dynamic degree without a significant
drop in video quality or image fidelity.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为MARMOT的掩码自编码器，用于建模瞬态成像，特别是非视距（NLOS）场景。通过自监督预训练和大规模数据集，MARMOT能够高效地完成下游成像任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在非视距场景中主要优化体积密度或表面重建隐藏物体，而未利用数据集学习的先验知识。因此，作者提出MARMOT，以自监督方式学习瞬态成像特征。

Method: MARMOT是一种基于Transformer的编码器-解码器模型，通过扫描模式掩码（SPM）从部分掩码的瞬态数据中学习特征，并预测完整测量。模型在合成的瞬态数据集TransVerse（包含500K 3D模型）上预训练。

Result: 实验表明，MARMOT在定量和定性结果上均优于现有方法，证明了其高效性。

Conclusion: MARMOT通过自监督预训练和特征迁移，为非视距瞬态成像任务提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: Pretrained models have demonstrated impressive success in many modalities
such as language and vision. Recent works facilitate the pretraining paradigm
in imaging research. Transients are a novel modality, which are captured for an
object as photon counts versus arrival times using a precisely time-resolved
sensor. In particular for non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios, transients of
hidden objects are measured beyond the sensor's direct line of sight. Using
NLOS transients, the majority of previous works optimize volume density or
surfaces to reconstruct the hidden objects and do not transfer priors learned
from datasets. In this work, we present a masked autoencoder for modeling
transient imaging, or MARMOT, to facilitate NLOS applications. Our MARMOT is a
self-supervised model pretrianed on massive and diverse NLOS transient
datasets. Using a Transformer-based encoder-decoder, MARMOT learns features
from partially masked transients via a scanning pattern mask (SPM), where the
unmasked subset is functionally equivalent to arbitrary sampling, and predicts
full measurements. Pretrained on TransVerse-a synthesized transient dataset of
500K 3D models-MARMOT adapts to downstream imaging tasks using direct feature
transfer or decoder finetuning. Comprehensive experiments are carried out in
comparisons with state-of-the-art methods. Quantitative and qualitative results
demonstrate the efficiency of our MARMOT.

<details>

Motivation: 现有研究多将深度伪造检测视为分类任务，忽略了视频中部分片段被篡改的情况，而实际应用中更需精确定位篡改片段。

Method: 采用监督对比学习，结合上下文感知感知层和自适应上下文更新器，通过对比真实与伪造片段特征的距离来增强区分能力。

Result: 在五个公开数据集上的实验表明，UniCaCLF显著优于现有算法。

Conclusion: UniCaCLF为部分视频片段篡改的定位提供了高效解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Most research efforts in the multimedia forensics domain have focused on
detecting forgery audio-visual content and reached sound achievements. However,
these works only consider deepfake detection as a classification task and
ignore the case where partial segments of the video are tampered with. Temporal
forgery localization (TFL) of small fake audio-visual clips embedded in real
videos is still challenging and more in line with realistic application
scenarios. To resolve this issue, we propose a universal context-aware
contrastive learning framework (UniCaCLF) for TFL. Our approach leverages
supervised contrastive learning to discover and identify forged instants by
means of anomaly detection, allowing for the precise localization of temporal
forged segments. To this end, we propose a novel context-aware perception layer
that utilizes a heterogeneous activation operation and an adaptive context
updater to construct a context-aware contrastive objective, which enhances the
discriminability of forged instant features by contrasting them with genuine
instant features in terms of their distances to the global context. An
efficient context-aware contrastive coding is introduced to further push the
limit of instant feature distinguishability between genuine and forged instants
in a supervised sample-by-sample manner, suppressing the cross-sample influence
to improve temporal forgery localization performance. Extensive experimental
results over five public datasets demonstrate that our proposed UniCaCLF
significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art competing algorithms.

Motivation: 现有基于Transformer的方法存在冗余注意力和次优多模态对齐问题，影响了视频时间定位的准确性。

Method: MLVTG采用MambaAligner（基于Vision Mamba块）建模时间依赖，并结合LLMRefiner（利用预训练LLM的冻结层）增强语义对齐。

Result: 在QVHighlights、Charades-STA和TVSum数据集上，MLVTG实现了最先进的性能，显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: MLVTG通过双对齐策略（时间建模和语义净化）有效提升了视频时间定位的精确性。

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG), which aims to localize video clips
corresponding to natural language queries, is a fundamental yet challenging
task in video understanding. Existing Transformer-based methods often suffer
from redundant attention and suboptimal multi-modal alignment. To address these
limitations, we propose MLVTG, a novel framework that integrates two key
modules: MambaAligner and LLMRefiner. MambaAligner uses stacked Vision Mamba
blocks as a backbone instead of Transformers to model temporal dependencies and
extract robust video representations for multi-modal alignment. LLMRefiner
leverages the specific frozen layer of a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM)
to implicitly transfer semantic priors, enhancing multi-modal alignment without
fine-tuning. This dual alignment strategy, temporal modeling via structured
state-space dynamics and semantic purification via textual priors, enables more
precise localization. Extensive experiments on QVHighlights, Charades-STA, and
TVSum demonstrate that MLVTG achieves state-of-the-art performance and
significantly outperforms existing baselines.

Conclusion: 结合多尺度处理和语义指导是动态环境中实现鲁棒视觉定位的有效策略。

Abstract: Visual localization remains challenging in dynamic environments where
fluctuating lighting, adverse weather, and moving objects disrupt appearance
cues. Despite advances in feature representation, current absolute pose
regression methods struggle to maintain consistency under varying conditions.
To address this challenge, we propose a framework that synergistically combines
multi-scale feature learning with semantic scene understanding. Our approach
employs a hierarchical Transformer with cross-scale attention to fuse geometric
details and contextual cues, preserving spatial precision while adapting to
environmental changes. We improve the performance of this architecture with
semantic supervision via neural scene representation during training, guiding
the network to learn view-invariant features that encode persistent structural
information while suppressing complex environmental interference. Experiments
on TartanAir demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing pose regression
methods in challenging scenarios with dynamic objects, illumination changes,
and occlusions. Our findings show that integrating multi-scale processing with
semantic guidance offers a promising strategy for robust visual localization in
real-world dynamic environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频超分辨率方法在时间一致性和计算成本方面存在不足，尤其是长视频处理需要大量计算资源。

Method: 提出LiftVSR框架，采用动态时间注意力（DTA）进行短帧段精细建模，注意力记忆缓存（AMC）实现长期一致性，并引入非对称采样策略优化缓存交互。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，LiftVSR以显著降低的计算成本实现了优异的性能。

Conclusion: LiftVSR在效率和性能之间取得了平衡，为视频超分辨率提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have significantly advanced video super-resolution (VSR) by
enhancing perceptual quality, largely through elaborately designed temporal
modeling to ensure inter-frame consistency. However, existing methods usually
suffer from limited temporal coherence and prohibitively high computational
costs (e.g., typically requiring over 8 NVIDIA A100-80G GPUs), especially for
long videos. In this work, we propose LiftVSR, an efficient VSR framework that
leverages and elevates the image-wise diffusion prior from PixArt-$\alpha$,
achieving state-of-the-art results using only 4$\times$RTX 4090 GPUs. To
balance long-term consistency and efficiency, we introduce a hybrid temporal
modeling mechanism that decomposes temporal learning into two complementary
components: (i) Dynamic Temporal Attention (DTA) for fine-grained temporal
modeling within short frame segment ($\textit{i.e.}$, low complexity), and (ii)
Attention Memory Cache (AMC) for long-term temporal modeling across segments
($\textit{i.e.}$, consistency). Specifically, DTA identifies multiple token
flows across frames within multi-head query and key tokens to warp inter-frame
contexts in the value tokens. AMC adaptively aggregates historical segment
information via a cache unit, ensuring long-term coherence with minimal
overhead. To further stabilize the cache interaction during inference, we
introduce an asymmetric sampling strategy that mitigates feature mismatches
arising from different diffusion sampling steps. Extensive experiments on
several typical VSR benchmarks have demonstrated that LiftVSR achieves
impressive performance with significantly lower computational costs.

Conclusion: TrajFlow为安全关键型自动驾驶应用提供了一种高效且可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Efficient and accurate motion prediction is crucial for ensuring safety and
informed decision-making in autonomous driving, particularly under dynamic
real-world conditions that necessitate multi-modal forecasts. We introduce
TrajFlow, a novel flow matching-based motion prediction framework that
addresses the scalability and efficiency challenges of existing generative
trajectory prediction methods. Unlike conventional generative approaches that
employ i.i.d. sampling and require multiple inference passes to capture diverse
outcomes, TrajFlow predicts multiple plausible future trajectories in a single
pass, significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining coherence
across predictions. Moreover, we propose a ranking loss based on the
Plackett-Luce distribution to improve uncertainty estimation of predicted
trajectories. Additionally, we design a self-conditioning training technique
that reuses the model's own predictions to construct noisy inputs during a
second forward pass, thereby improving generalization and accelerating
inference. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Waymo Open Motion Dataset
(WOMD) demonstrate that TrajFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance across
various key metrics, underscoring its effectiveness for safety-critical
autonomous driving applications. The code and other details are available on

Conclusion: 通过理论洞察与实证验证的结合，推动了深度网络中表示形成的结构化理论，为提升AI的鲁棒性、公平性和透明性奠定了基础。

Abstract: High-level representations have become a central focus in enhancing AI
transparency and control, shifting attention from individual neurons or
circuits to structured semantic directions that align with human-interpretable
concepts. Motivated by the Linear Representation Hypothesis (LRH), we propose
the Input-Space Linearity Hypothesis (ISLH), which posits that concept-aligned
directions originate in the input space and are selectively amplified with
increasing depth. We then introduce the Spectral Principal Path (SPP)
framework, which formalizes how deep networks progressively distill linear
representations along a small set of dominant spectral directions. Building on
this framework, we further demonstrate the multimodal robustness of these
representations in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). By bridging theoretical
insights with empirical validation, this work advances a structured theory of
representation formation in deep networks, paving the way for improving AI
robustness, fairness, and transparency.

distinct strengths across the seven categories of the HD-EPIC benchmark, and
their combination within our framework results in an overall accuracy of 44.21%
on the challenge, highlighting its effectiveness for complex egocentric VQA
tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种通过特征解耦消除校准需求的方法，实现跨受试者肌电信号模式识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨受试者肌电信号模式识别因个体差异面临挑战，传统方法依赖校准数据，耗时且不实用。

Method: 采用端到端双分支对抗神经网络，将肌电特征解耦为模式相关和个体相关部分。

Result: 模型在未见用户数据上表现稳健，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 为无需校准的跨受试者肌电识别提供新思路，具有广泛潜在应用。

Abstract: Cross-subject electromyography (EMG) pattern recognition faces significant
challenges due to inter-subject variability in muscle anatomy, electrode
placement, and signal characteristics. Traditional methods rely on
subject-specific calibration data to adapt models to new users, an approach
that is both time-consuming and impractical for large-scale, real-world
deployment. This paper presents an approach to eliminate calibration
requirements through feature disentanglement, enabling effective cross-subject
generalization. We propose an end-to-end dual-branch adversarial neural network
that simultaneously performs pattern recognition and individual identification
by disentangling EMG features into pattern-specific and subject-specific
components. The pattern-specific components facilitate robust pattern
recognition for new users without model calibration, while the subject-specific
components enable downstream applications such as task-invariant biometric
identification. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model
achieves robust performance on data from unseen users, outperforming various
baseline methods in cross-subject scenarios. Overall, this study offers a new
perspective for cross-subject EMG pattern recognition without model calibration
and highlights the proposed model's potential for broader applications, such as
task-independent biometric systems.

Conclusion: Hier-DETR为增量目标检测提供了一种高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, object detection models have witnessed notable performance
improvements, particularly with transformer-based models. However, new objects
frequently appear in the real world, requiring detection models to continually
learn without suffering from catastrophic forgetting. Although Incremental
Object Detection (IOD) has emerged to address this challenge, these existing

Hier-DETR: Hierarchical Neural Collapse Detection Transformer, ensuring both
efficiency and competitive performance by leveraging Neural Collapse for
imbalance dataset and Hierarchical relation of classes' labels.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出FCA-NIG框架，自动生成具有细粒度跨模态标注的导航指令，构建FCA-R2R数据集，显著提升VLN智能体的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集缺乏细粒度的跨模态对齐标注（如子指令级和实体级），影响导航决策的准确性。

Method: 通过分割轨迹、检测地标、生成指令和选择实体，构建子指令-轨迹对，最终形成完整指令-轨迹对。

Result: FCA-R2R数据集显著提升了多个VLN智能体的性能，增强了状态感知和导航泛化能力。

Conclusion: FCA-NIG框架无需人工标注即可生成高质量训练数据，推动了复杂导航任务中的细粒度跨模态学习。

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) enables intelligent agents to navigate
environments by integrating visual perception and natural language
instructions, yet faces significant challenges due to the scarcity of
fine-grained cross-modal alignment annotations. Existing datasets primarily
focus on global instruction-trajectory matching, neglecting
sub-instruction-level and entity-level alignments critical for accurate
navigation action decision-making. To address this limitation, we propose
FCA-NIG, a generative framework that automatically constructs navigation
instructions with dual-level fine-grained cross-modal annotations. In this
framework, an augmented trajectory is first divided into sub-trajectories,
which are then processed through GLIP-based landmark detection, crafted
instruction construction, OFA-Speaker based R2R-like instruction generation,
and CLIP-powered entity selection, generating sub-instruction-trajectory pairs
with entity-landmark annotations. Finally, these sub-pairs are aggregated to
form a complete instruction-trajectory pair. The framework generates the
FCA-R2R dataset, the first large-scale augmentation dataset featuring precise
sub-instruction-sub-trajectory and entity-landmark alignments. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that training with FCA-R2R significantly improves the
performance of multiple state-of-the-art VLN agents, including SF, EnvDrop,
RecBERT, and HAMT. Incorporating sub-instruction-trajectory alignment enhances
agents' state awareness and decision accuracy, while entity-landmark alignment
further boosts navigation performance and generalization. These results
highlight the effectiveness of FCA-NIG in generating high-quality, scalable
training data without manual annotation, advancing fine-grained cross-modal
learning in complex navigation tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多样性引导的MLP压缩方法（DGMR），显著减少大型视觉Transformer的参数，同时性能损失极小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模Transformer模型的参数过多导致计算和内存成本高昂，而MLP模块占据了大部分参数。

Method: 采用Gram-Schmidt权重剪枝策略，消除MLP隐藏层的冗余神经元，同时保留权重多样性以在蒸馏过程中更好地恢复性能。

Result: 在多个先进的大型视觉Transformer上，DGMR实现了超过57%的参数和FLOPs减少，且性能几乎无损。对于EVA-CLIP-E（4.4B），参数和FLOPs减少71.5%且无性能下降。

Conclusion: DGMR是一种高效的模型压缩方法，适用于大规模视觉Transformer，显著减少资源消耗且性能损失极小。

Abstract: Transformer models achieve excellent scaling property, where the performance
is improved with the increment of model capacity. However, large-scale model
parameters lead to an unaffordable cost of computing and memory. We analyze
popular transformer architectures and find that multilayer perceptron (MLP)
modules take up the majority of model parameters. To this end, we focus on the
recoverability of the compressed models and propose a Diversity-Guided MLP
Reduction (DGMR) method to significantly reduce the parameters of large vision
transformers with only negligible performance degradation. Specifically, we
conduct a Gram-Schmidt weight pruning strategy to eliminate redundant neurons
of MLP hidden layer, while preserving weight diversity for better performance
recover during distillation. Compared to the model trained from scratch, our
pruned model only requires 0.06\% data of LAION-2B (for the training of large
vision transformers) without labels (ImageNet-1K) to recover the original
performance. Experimental results on several state-of-the-art large vision
transformers demonstrate that our method achieves a more than 57.0\% parameter
and FLOPs reduction in a near lossless manner. Notably, for EVA-CLIP-E (4.4B),
our method accomplishes a 71.5\% parameter and FLOPs reduction without
performance degradation. The source code and trained weights are available at

Abstract: Transformers have become the architecture of choice for learning long-range
dependencies, yet their adoption in hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is still
emerging. We reviewed more than 300 papers published up to 2025 and present the
first end-to-end survey dedicated to Transformer-based HSI classification. The
study categorizes every stage of a typical pipeline-pre-processing, patch or
pixel tokenization, positional encoding, spatial-spectral feature extraction,
multi-head self-attention variants, skip connections, and loss design-and
contrasts alternative design choices with the unique spatial-spectral
properties of HSI. We map the field's progress against persistent obstacles:
scarce labeled data, extreme spectral dimensionality, computational overhead,
and limited model explainability. Finally, we outline a research agenda
prioritizing valuable public data sets, lightweight on-edge models,
illumination and sensor shifts robustness, and intrinsically interpretable
attention mechanisms. Our goal is to guide researchers in selecting, combining,
or extending Transformer components that are truly fit for purpose for
next-generation HSI applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗训练（AT）和对抗鲁棒性蒸馏（ARD）存在鲁棒公平性问题，即模型对某些类别表现出强鲁棒性，而对其他类别表现较弱。本文旨在探索这一问题的原因并提出解决方案。

Method: 提出Anti-Bias Soft Label Distillation (ABSLD)，通过为不同类别分配不同温度值来调整软标签的平滑度，从而减少学生模型在不同类别间的误差风险差距。

Result: 实验表明，ABSLD在鲁棒性和公平性的综合性能上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ABSLD是一种高效且适应性强的解决方案，能够显著提升对抗训练的鲁棒公平性。

Abstract: Adversarial Training (AT) is widely recognized as an effective approach to
enhance the adversarial robustness of Deep Neural Networks. As a variant of AT,
Adversarial Robustness Distillation (ARD) has shown outstanding performance in
enhancing the robustness of small models. However, both AT and ARD face robust
fairness issue: these models tend to display strong adversarial robustness
against some classes (easy classes) while demonstrating weak adversarial
robustness against others (hard classes). This paper explores the underlying
factors of this problem and points out the smoothness degree of soft labels for
different classes significantly impacts the robust fairness from both empirical
observation and theoretical analysis. Based on the above exploration, we
propose Anti-Bias Soft Label Distillation (ABSLD) within the Knowledge
Distillation framework to enhance the adversarial robust fairness.
Specifically, ABSLD adaptively reduces the student's error risk gap between
different classes, which is accomplished by adjusting the class-wise smoothness
degree of teacher's soft labels during the training process, and the adjustment
is managed by assigning varying temperatures to different classes.
Additionally, as a label-based approach, ABSLD is highly adaptable and can be
integrated with the sample-based methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate
ABSLD outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the comprehensive performance of
robustness and fairness.

Abstract: Deep Learning requires large amounts of data to train models that work well.
In data-deficient settings, performance can be degraded. We investigate which
Deep Learning methods benefit training models in a data-deficient setting, by
organizing the "VIPriors: Visual Inductive Priors for Data-Efficient Deep

These challenges address the problem of training deep learning models for
computer vision tasks with limited data. Participants are limited to training
models from scratch using a low number of training samples and are not allowed
to use any form of transfer learning. We aim to stimulate the development of
novel approaches that incorporate prior knowledge to improve the data
efficiency of deep learning models. Successful challenge entries make use of
large model ensembles that mix Transformers and CNNs, as well as heavy data
augmentation. Novel prior knowledge-based methods contribute to success in some
entries.

TL;DR: SAMSelect是一种算法，用于从多光谱图像中选择最佳三通道可视化组合，以帮助海洋科学家更直观地识别海洋漂浮物。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海洋漂浮物在中等分辨率图像中因成分异质性难以可视化，而专家通常依赖经验和启发式方法选择波段或光谱指数。SAMSelect旨在通过自动化选择提升可视化效果。

Method: SAMSelect利用Segment Anything Model在小标注数据集上选择分类准确率最高的波段或光谱指数组合，假设最佳分割结果也适合视觉解译。

Result: 在加纳阿克拉和南非德班的Sentinel-2场景中测试，SAMSelect发现了新的未使用波段组合（如B8和B2的归一化差异指数），性能优于文献中的指数。

Conclusion: SAMSelect为海洋领域的视觉解译提供了有效工具，并开源了代码库，便于科学家使用。

Abstract: This work proposes SAMSelect, an algorithm to obtain a salient three-channel
visualization for multispectral images. We develop SAMSelect and show its use
for marine scientists visually interpreting floating marine debris in
Sentinel-2 imagery. These debris are notoriously difficult to visualize due to
their compositional heterogeneity in medium-resolution imagery. Out of these
difficulties, a visual interpretation of imagery showing marine debris remains
a common practice by domain experts, who select bands and spectral indices on a
case-by-case basis informed by common practices and heuristics. SAMSelect
selects the band or index combination that achieves the best classification
accuracy on a small annotated dataset through the Segment Anything Model. Its
central assumption is that the three-channel visualization achieves the most
accurate segmentation results also provide good visual information for
photo-interpretation.
  We evaluate SAMSelect in three Sentinel-2 scenes containing generic marine
debris in Accra, Ghana, and Durban, South Africa, and deployed plastic targets
from the Plastic Litter Project. This reveals the potential of new previously
unused band combinations (e.g., a normalized difference index of B8, B2), which
demonstrate improved performance compared to literature-based indices. We
describe the algorithm in this paper and provide an open-source code repository
that will be helpful for domain scientists doing visual photo interpretation,
especially in the marine field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NeRF及其变体在训练时无法覆盖所有可能的输入数据（如所有像素和3D点），导致采样效率低。本文旨在通过更精准的采样策略和新的损失函数，提升渲染和重建的准确性。

Method: 利用前景场景的隐式表面表示，在3D图像投影空间中建模概率密度函数，实现针对感兴趣区域的射线采样。同时提出新的表面重建损失函数，结合近表面和空空间信息。

Result: 通过将新采样策略和损失函数应用于现有神经隐式表面渲染器，显著提升了3D重建和图像渲染的准确性，尤其在感兴趣区域表现更优。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法通过改进采样和损失函数，显著提升了NeRF在3D重建和渲染中的性能，为未来研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Several variants of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have significantly
improved the accuracy of synthesized images and surface reconstruction of 3D
scenes/objects. In all of these methods, a key characteristic is that none can
train the neural network with every possible input data, specifically, every
pixel and potential 3D point along the projection rays due to scalability
issues. While vanilla NeRFs uniformly sample both the image pixels and 3D
points along the projection rays, some variants focus only on guiding the
sampling of the 3D points along the projection rays. In this paper, we leverage
the implicit surface representation of the foreground scene and model a
probability density function in a 3D image projection space to achieve a more
targeted sampling of the rays toward regions of interest, resulting in improved
rendering. Additionally, a new surface reconstruction loss is proposed for
improved performance. This new loss fully explores the proposed 3D image
projection space model and incorporates near-to-surface and empty space
components. By integrating our novel sampling strategy and novel loss into
current state-of-the-art neural implicit surface renderers, we achieve more
accurate and detailed 3D reconstructions and improved image rendering,
especially for the regions of interest in any given scene.

Abstract: In the past decade, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers
have achieved wide applicaiton in semantic segmentation tasks. Although CNNs
with Transformer models greatly improve performance, the global context
modeling remains inadequate. Recently, Mamba achieved great potential in vision
tasks, showing its advantages in modeling long-range dependency. In this paper,
we propose a lightweight Efficient CNN-Mamba Network for semantic segmentation,
dubbed as ECMNet. ECMNet combines CNN with Mamba skillfully in a capsule-based
framework to address their complementary weaknesses. Specifically, We design a
Enhanced Dual-Attention Block (EDAB) for lightweight bottleneck. In order to
improve the representations ability of feature, We devise a Multi-Scale
Attention Unit (MSAU) to integrate multi-scale feature aggregation, spatial
aggregation and channel aggregation. Moreover, a Mamba enhanced Feature Fusion
Module (FFM) merges diverse level feature, significantly enhancing segmented
accuracy. Extensive experiments on two representative datasets demonstrate that
the proposed model excels in accuracy and efficiency balance, achieving 70.6%
mIoU on Cityscapes and 73.6% mIoU on CamVid test datasets, with 0.87M
parameters and 8.27G FLOPs on a single RTX 3090 GPU platform.

Result: 在三个基准测试中，RoboSwap在结构连贯性和运动一致性上优于现有视频和图像编辑模型。

Conclusion: RoboSwap为机器人学习提供了可靠的跨平台数据生成解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative models have revolutionized video synthesis
and editing. However, the scarcity of diverse, high-quality datasets continues
to hinder video-conditioned robotic learning, limiting cross-platform
generalization. In this work, we address the challenge of swapping a robotic
arm in one video with another: a key step for crossembodiment learning. Unlike
previous methods that depend on paired video demonstrations in the same
environmental settings, our proposed framework, RoboSwap, operates on unpaired
data from diverse environments, alleviating the data collection needs. RoboSwap
introduces a novel video editing pipeline integrating both GANs and diffusion
models, combining their isolated advantages. Specifically, we segment robotic
arms from their backgrounds and train an unpaired GAN model to translate one
robotic arm to another. The translated arm is blended with the original video
background and refined with a diffusion model to enhance coherence, motion
realism and object interaction. The GAN and diffusion stages are trained
independently. Our experiments demonstrate that RoboSwap outperforms
state-of-the-art video and image editing models on three benchmarks in terms of
both structural coherence and motion consistency, thereby offering a robust
solution for generating reliable, cross-embodiment data in robotic learning.

Conclusion: 通过三项关键贡献，本文提出的隐式表示方法在速度和精度上取得了显著改进，适用于通用3D形状重建。

Abstract: We propose a fast and accurate surface reconstruction algorithm for
unorganized point clouds using an implicit representation. Recent learning
methods are either single-object representations with small neural models that
allow for high surface details but require per-object training or generalized
representations that require larger models and generalize to newer shapes but
lack details, and inference is slow. We propose a new implicit representation
for general 3D shapes that is faster than all the baselines at their optimum
resolution, with only a marginal loss in performance compared to the
state-of-the-art. We achieve the best accuracy-speed trade-off using three key
contributions. Many implicit methods extract features from the point cloud to
classify whether a query point is inside or outside the object. First, to speed
up the reconstruction, we show that this feature extraction does not need to
use the query point at an early stage (lazy query). Second, we use a parallel
multi-scale grid representation to develop robust features for different noise
levels and input resolutions. Finally, we show that attention across scales can
provide improved reconstruction results.

Conclusion: 通过方向对齐的3D生成，显著提升了模型的实用性和下游任务表现。

Abstract: Humans intuitively perceive object shape and orientation from a single image,
guided by strong priors about canonical poses. However, existing 3D generative
models often produce misaligned results due to inconsistent training data,
limiting their usability in downstream tasks. To address this gap, we introduce
the task of orientation-aligned 3D object generation: producing 3D objects from
single images with consistent orientations across categories. To facilitate
this, we construct Objaverse-OA, a dataset of 14,832 orientation-aligned 3D
models spanning 1,008 categories. Leveraging Objaverse-OA, we fine-tune two
representative 3D generative models based on multi-view diffusion and 3D
variational autoencoder frameworks to produce aligned objects that generalize
well to unseen objects across various categories. Experimental results
demonstrate the superiority of our method over post-hoc alignment approaches.
Furthermore, we showcase downstream applications enabled by our aligned object
generation, including zero-shot object orientation estimation via
analysis-by-synthesis and efficient arrow-based object rotation manipulation.

Conclusion: TMCCL显著提升了运动特征表示和记忆性预测准确性，MWCVS展示了记忆性预测在视频摘要中的潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Video memorability refers to the ability of videos to be recalled after
viewing, playing a crucial role in creating content that remains memorable.
Existing models typically focus on extracting multimodal features to predict
video memorability scores but often fail to fully utilize motion cues. The
representation of motion features is compromised during the fine-tuning phase
of the motion feature extractor due to a lack of labeled data. In this paper,
we introduce the Text-Motion Cross-modal Contrastive Loss (TMCCL), a multimodal
video memorability prediction model designed to enhance the representation of
motion features. We tackle the challenge of improving motion feature
representation by leveraging text description similarities across videos to
establish positive and negative motion sample sets for a given target. This
enhancement allows the model to learn similar feature representations for
semantically related motion content, resulting in more accurate memorability
predictions. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on two video
memorability prediction datasets. Moreover, the potential applications of video
memorability prediction have been underexplored. To address this gap, we
present Memorability Weighted Correction for Video Summarization (MWCVS), using
video memorability prediction to reduce subjectivity in video summarization
labels. Experimental results on two video summarization datasets demonstrate
the effectiveness of MWCVS, showcasing the promising applications of video
memorability prediction.

for seamless image fusion and Image Processing Pipeline (ISP) compatibility in
modern devices, but it is a challenging task due to variations in sensors and
optics. Existing raw-to-raw conversion methods face limitations such as poor
adaptability to changing illumination, high computational costs, or impractical
requirements such as simultaneous camera operation and overlapping
fields-of-view. We introduce the Neural Physical Model (NPM), a lightweight,
physically-informed approach that simulates raw images under specified
illumination to estimate transformations between devices. The NPM effectively
adapts to varying illumination conditions, can be initialized with physical
measurements, and supports training with or without paired data. Experiments on
public datasets like NUS and BeyondRGB demonstrate that NPM outperforms recent
state-of-the-art methods, providing robust chromatic consistency across
different sensors and optical systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LLaVA-c通过谱感知巩固和无监督查询正则化改进LLaVA-1.5，解决了多任务学习中的任务平衡和基础模型退化问题，在持续学习中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务学习存在任务平衡和扩展成本问题，持续学习虽能增量获取知识，但当前方法忽视基础模型退化。

Method: 在LLaVA-1.5基础上引入谱感知巩固和无监督查询正则化。

Result: LLaVA-c在持续预训练和微调中均提升性能，首次证明任务级持续学习可媲美多任务联合学习。

Conclusion: LLaVA-c有效解决了多任务学习的挑战，同时保持了模型的通用能力。

Abstract: Multimodal models like LLaVA-1.5 achieve state-of-the-art visual
understanding through visual instruction tuning on multitask datasets, enabling
strong instruction-following and multimodal performance. However, multitask
learning faces challenges such as task balancing, requiring careful adjustment
of data proportions, and expansion costs, where new tasks risk catastrophic
forgetting and need costly retraining. Continual learning provides a promising
alternative to acquiring new knowledge incrementally while preserving existing
capabilities. However, current methods prioritize task-specific performance,
neglecting base model degradation from overfitting to specific instructions,
which undermines general capabilities. In this work, we propose a simple but
effective method with two modifications on LLaVA-1.5: spectral-aware
consolidation for improved task balance and unsupervised inquiry regularization
to prevent base model degradation. We evaluate both general and task-specific
performance across continual pretraining and fine-tuning. Experiments
demonstrate that LLaVA-c consistently enhances standard benchmark performance
and preserves general capabilities. For the first time, we show that
task-by-task continual learning can achieve results that match or surpass
multitask joint learning. The code will be publicly released.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ATAS的自蒸馏方法，旨在提升CLIP模型在细粒度区域理解上的性能，同时保持语义一致性，无需额外模块或有监督微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP模型在开放词汇密集预测任务中表现优异，但在细粒度区域理解上仍有不足，需要同时提升语义一致性和细粒度视觉-语言对齐。

Method: 提出Any-to-Any Self-Distillation (ATAS)，通过无标签图像和内部自蒸馏过程优化CLIP视觉编码器的表示，保持局部语义一致性的同时增强细节识别能力。

Result: 在开放词汇目标检测和语义分割任务中，ATAS显著优于基线CLIP模型。

Conclusion: ATAS证明了同时保持语义一致性和细粒度对齐对开放词汇密集预测任务的重要性。

Abstract: Vision-language models such as CLIP have recently propelled open-vocabulary
dense prediction tasks by enabling recognition of a broad range of visual
concepts. However, CLIP still struggles with fine-grained, region-level
understanding, hindering its effectiveness on these dense prediction tasks. We
identify two pivotal factors required to address this limitation: semantic
coherence and fine-grained vision-language alignment. Current adaptation
methods often improve fine-grained alignment at the expense of semantic
coherence, and often rely on extra modules or supervised fine-tuning. To
overcome these issues, we propose Any-to-Any Self-Distillation (ATAS), a novel
approach that simultaneously enhances semantic coherence and fine-grained
alignment by leveraging own knowledge of a model across all representation
levels. Unlike prior methods, ATAS uses only unlabeled images and an internal
self-distillation process to refine representations of CLIP vision encoders,
preserving local semantic consistency while sharpening local detail
recognition. On open-vocabulary object detection and semantic segmentation
benchmarks, ATAS achieves substantial performance gains, outperforming baseline
CLIP models. These results validate the effectiveness of our approach and
underscore the importance of jointly maintaining semantic coherence and
fine-grained alignment for advanced open-vocabulary dense prediction.

TL;DR: 加拿大2023年经历了严重的野火季节，本文提出高分辨率野火预测方法，利用多模态数据和深度学习模型，显著提升了预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 气候变化导致野火季节延长和加剧，亟需更有效的野火管理工具。高分辨率预测模型是解决这一问题的关键。

Method: 利用多模态数据（Sentinel-2、MODIS、ERA5）和深度学习架构，开发高分辨率（100米）野火预测模型。

Result: 多模态输入显著优于单模态输入，F1分数达60.3%，在未见过的2023年野火季节表现良好。

Conclusion: 多模态深度学习模型在高分辨率和大陆尺度野火预测中具有潜力。

Abstract: Canada experienced in 2023 one of the most severe wildfire seasons in recent
history, causing damage across ecosystems, destroying communities, and emitting
large quantities of CO2. This extreme wildfire season is symptomatic of a
climate-change-induced increase in the length and severity of the fire season
that affects the boreal ecosystem. Therefore, it is critical to empower
wildfire management in boreal communities with better mitigation solutions.
Wildfire probability maps represent an important tool for understanding the
likelihood of wildfire occurrence and the potential severity of future
wildfires. The massive increase in the availability of Earth observation data
has enabled the development of deep learning-based wildfire forecasting models,
aiming at providing precise wildfire probability maps at different spatial and
temporal scales. A main limitation of such methods is their reliance on
coarse-resolution environmental drivers and satellite products, leading to
wildfire occurrence prediction of reduced resolution, typically around $\sim
0.1${\deg}. This paper presents a benchmark dataset: CanadaFireSat, and
baseline methods for high-resolution: 100 m wildfire forecasting across Canada,
leveraging multi-modal data from high-resolution multi-spectral satellite
images (Sentinel-2 L1C), mid-resolution satellite products (MODIS), and
environmental factors (ERA5 reanalysis data). Our experiments consider two
major deep learning architectures. We observe that using multi-modal temporal
inputs outperforms single-modal temporal inputs across all metrics, achieving a
peak performance of 60.3% in F1 score for the 2023 wildfire season, a season
never seen during model training. This demonstrates the potential of
multi-modal deep learning models for wildfire forecasting at high-resolution
and continental scale.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown exceptional performance in
multimodal tasks, but their effectiveness in complex visual reasoning is still
constrained, especially when employing Chain-of-Thought prompting techniques.
In this paper, we propose VReST, a novel training-free approach that enhances
Reasoning in LVLMs through Monte Carlo Tree Search and Self-Reward mechanisms.
VReST meticulously traverses the reasoning landscape by establishing a search
tree, where each node encapsulates a reasoning step, and each path delineates a
comprehensive reasoning sequence. Our innovative multimodal Self-Reward
mechanism assesses the quality of reasoning steps by integrating the utility of
sub-questions, answer correctness, and the relevance of vision-language clues,
all without the need for additional models. VReST surpasses current prompting
methods and secures state-of-the-art performance across three multimodal
mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, it substantiates the efficacy
of test-time scaling laws in multimodal tasks, offering a promising direction
for future research.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖静态增强，无法处理物体变形、遮挡和相机运动，导致特征学习不一致。

Method: 利用现成的点跟踪器提取长程运动轨迹，通过动量编码器的最优传输机制优化特征聚类，并沿跟踪点传播聚类分配以确保时间一致性。

Result: 在六个图像和视频数据集及四个评估基准上，性能提升了1%至6%。

Conclusion: 通过运动作为隐式监督信号，该方法在动态场景和遮挡挑战中表现出色，代码已开源。

Abstract: Dense self-supervised learning has shown great promise for learning pixel-
and patch-level representations, but extending it to videos remains challenging
due to the complexity of motion dynamics. Existing approaches struggle as they
rely on static augmentations that fail under object deformations, occlusions,
and camera movement, leading to inconsistent feature learning over time. We
propose a motion-guided self-supervised learning framework that clusters dense
point tracks to learn spatiotemporally consistent representations. By
leveraging an off-the-shelf point tracker, we extract long-range motion
trajectories and optimize feature clustering through a momentum-encoder-based
optimal transport mechanism. To ensure temporal coherence, we propagate cluster
assignments along tracked points, enforcing feature consistency across views
despite viewpoint changes. Integrating motion as an implicit supervisory
signal, our method learns representations that generalize across frames,
improving robustness in dynamic scenes and challenging occlusion scenarios. By
initializing from strong image-pretrained models and leveraging video data for
training, we improve state-of-the-art by 1% to 6% on six image and video
datasets and four evaluation benchmarks. The implementation is publicly
available at our GitHub repository: https://github.com/SMSD75/MoSiC/tree/main

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，PSNR平均提升1.86 dB（空中）和1.62 dB（地面）。

Conclusion: TraGraph-GS显著提升大规模场景的渲染质量和效率。

Abstract: High-quality novel view synthesis for large-scale scenes presents a
challenging dilemma in 3D computer vision. Existing methods typically partition
large scenes into multiple regions, reconstruct a 3D representation using
Gaussian splatting for each region, and eventually merge them for novel view
rendering. They can accurately render specific scenes, yet they do not
generalize effectively for two reasons: (1) rigid spatial partition techniques
struggle with arbitrary camera trajectories, and (2) the merging of regions
results in Gaussian overlap to distort texture details. To address these
challenges, we propose TraGraph-GS, leveraging a trajectory graph to enable
high-precision rendering for arbitrarily large-scale scenes. We present a
spatial partitioning method for large-scale scenes based on graphs, which
incorporates a regularization constraint to enhance the rendering of textures
and distant objects, as well as a progressive rendering strategy to mitigate
artifacts caused by Gaussian overlap. Experimental results demonstrate its
superior performance both on four aerial and four ground datasets and highlight
its remarkable efficiency: our method achieves an average improvement of 1.86
dB in PSNR on aerial datasets and 1.62 dB on ground datasets compared to
state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) serves as a highly performant and efficient
encoding of scene geometry, appearance, and semantics. Moreover, grounding
language in 3D scenes has proven to be an effective strategy for 3D scene
understanding. Current Language Gaussian Splatting line of work fall into three
main groups: (i) per-scene optimization-based, (ii) per-scene
optimization-free, and (iii) generalizable approach. However, most of them are
evaluated only on rendered 2D views of a handful of scenes and viewpoints close
to the training views, limiting ability and insight into holistic 3D
understanding. To address this gap, we propose the first large-scale benchmark
that systematically assesses these three groups of methods directly in 3D
space, evaluating on 1060 scenes across three indoor datasets and one outdoor
dataset. Benchmark results demonstrate a clear advantage of the generalizable
paradigm, particularly in relaxing the scene-specific limitation, enabling fast
feed-forward inference on novel scenes, and achieving superior segmentation
performance. We further introduce GaussianWorld-49K a carefully curated 3DGS
dataset comprising around 49K diverse indoor and outdoor scenes obtained from
multiple sources, with which we demonstrate the generalizable approach could
harness strong data priors. Our codes, benchmark, and datasets will be made
public to accelerate research in generalizable 3DGS scene understanding.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于SE(3)-对称变换器模型的方法，用于预测腹主动脉瘤（AAA）的生长，通过保留血管表面的解剖结构和几何保真度，提高了预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前临床指南基于AAA最大直径的监测策略忽略了3D形状与生长的复杂关系，可能导致标准化监测间隔不适用。个性化AAA生长预测可以改善监测策略。

Method: 使用SE(3)-对称变换器模型，直接在血管模型表面预测AAA生长，并结合局部多物理特征。训练数据包括24名AAA患者的113次CTA扫描。

Result: 模型预测AAA生长的中位直径误差为1.18毫米，并能以93%的准确率识别患者是否在两年内需要手术修复。外部验证集也显示了模型的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过血管表面局部定向生长预测AAA生长是可行的，可能为个性化监测策略提供支持。

Abstract: Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are progressive focal dilatations of the
abdominal aorta. AAAs may rupture, with a survival rate of only 20\%. Current
clinical guidelines recommend elective surgical repair when the maximum AAA
diameter exceeds 55 mm in men or 50 mm in women. Patients that do not meet
these criteria are periodically monitored, with surveillance intervals based on
the maximum AAA diameter. However, this diameter does not take into account the
complex relation between the 3D AAA shape and its growth, making standardized
intervals potentially unfit. Personalized AAA growth predictions could improve
monitoring strategies. We propose to use an SE(3)-symmetric transformer model
to predict AAA growth directly on the vascular model surface enriched with
local, multi-physical features. In contrast to other works which have
parameterized the AAA shape, this representation preserves the vascular
surface's anatomical structure and geometric fidelity. We train our model using
a longitudinal dataset of 113 computed tomography angiography (CTA) scans of 24
AAA patients at irregularly sampled intervals. After training, our model
predicts AAA growth to the next scan moment with a median diameter error of
1.18 mm. We further demonstrate our model's utility to identify whether a
patient will become eligible for elective repair within two years (acc = 0.93).
Finally, we evaluate our model's generalization on an external validation set
consisting of 25 CTAs from 7 AAA patients from a different hospital. Our
results show that local directional AAA growth prediction from the vascular
surface is feasible and may contribute to personalized surveillance strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: InceptionNeXt在图像分类和下游任务中表现优异，但其一维条带卷积限制了空间依赖性的捕捉和局部邻域的空间建模能力，且卷积操作的局部性约束不利于全局上下文建模。

Method: 提出InceptionMamba架构，用正交带卷积替代传统一维条带卷积，并通过瓶颈Mamba模块实现全局上下文建模。

Result: 在分类和多个下游任务中，InceptionMamba实现了最先进的性能，并具有优越的参数和计算效率。

Conclusion: InceptionMamba通过改进的空间建模和全局上下文建模，显著提升了性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Within the family of convolutional neural networks, InceptionNeXt has shown
excellent competitiveness in image classification and a number of downstream
tasks. Built on parallel one-dimensional strip convolutions, however, it
suffers from limited ability of capturing spatial dependencies along different
dimensions and fails to fully explore spatial modeling in local neighborhood.
Besides, inherent locality constraints of convolution operations are
detrimental to effective global context modeling. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a novel backbone architecture termed InceptionMamba in
this study. More specifically, the traditional one-dimensional strip
convolutions are replaced by orthogonal band convolutions in our InceptionMamba
to achieve cohesive spatial modeling. Furthermore, global contextual modeling
can be achieved via a bottleneck Mamba module, facilitating enhanced
cross-channel information fusion and enlarged receptive field. Extensive
evaluations on classification and various downstream tasks demonstrate that the
proposed InceptionMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior
parameter and computational efficiency. The source code will be available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为RS-MTDF的半监督语义分割框架，利用预训练的视觉基础模型（VFMs）作为多教师，通过特征级蒸馏和知识融合提升遥感图像分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感图像的语义分割需要大量标注数据，但标注成本高且耗时。半监督学习（SSS）可以缓解这一问题，但现有方法在有限标注数据和大量未标注数据之间的分布不匹配问题上表现不佳。

Method: RS-MTDF框架利用多个冻结的VFMs（如DINOv2和CLIP）作为教师模型，通过特征级蒸馏将学生模型的特征与教师模型的鲁棒表示对齐，并将蒸馏知识融合到学生解码器中。

Result: 在ISPRS Potsdam、LoveDA和DeepGlobe三个数据集上的实验表明，RS-MTDF在多种标注比例下均达到最优性能，尤其在LoveDA上表现突出，并在多数语义类别中取得最高IoU。

Conclusion: 多教师VFM指导显著提升了遥感图像分割的泛化能力和语义理解能力，消融实验验证了各模块的有效性。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation in remote sensing images is crucial for various
applications, yet its performance is heavily reliant on large-scale,
high-quality pixel-wise annotations, which are notoriously expensive and
time-consuming to acquire. Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSS) offers a
promising alternative to mitigate this data dependency. However, existing SSS
methods often struggle with the inherent distribution mismatch between limited
labeled data and abundant unlabeled data, leading to suboptimal generalization.
We propose that Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), pre-trained on vast and
diverse datasets, possess robust generalization capabilities that can
effectively bridge this distribution gap and provide strong semantic priors for
SSS. Inspired by this, we introduce RS-MTDF (Multi-Teacher Distillation and
Fusion), a novel framework that leverages the powerful semantic knowledge
embedded in VFMs to guide semi-supervised learning in remote sensing.
Specifically, RS-MTDF employs multiple frozen VFMs (\textit{e.g.}, DINOv2 and
CLIP) as expert teachers, utilizing feature-level distillation to align student
features with their robust representations. To further enhance discriminative
power, the distilled knowledge is seamlessly fused into the student decoder.
Extensive experiments on three challenging remote sensing datasets (ISPRS
Potsdam, LoveDA, and DeepGlobe) demonstrate that RS-MTDF consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance. Notably, our method outperforms existing
approaches across various label ratios on LoveDA and secures the highest IoU in
the majority of semantic categories. These results underscore the efficacy of
multi-teacher VFM guidance in significantly enhancing both generalization and
semantic understanding for remote sensing segmentation. Ablation studies
further validate the contribution of each proposed module.

<details>

Motivation: 现有自监督学习方法在场景级别依赖体积渲染和RGB-D图像，存在内存需求高且难以捕捉3D几何结构的局限性。

Method: 采用3DGS进行预训练，分两阶段训练：第一阶段通过双分支掩码自编码器学习2D和3D场景表示；第二阶段利用重建点云和高斯基元的几何位置进行监督学习。

Result: 在多个下游3D物体检测任务中表现出优于现有预训练方法的性能。

Conclusion: Gaussian2Scene通过直接3D场景重建和几何学习，提升了模型的几何理解能力，同时降低了计算负担。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) for point cloud pre-training has become a
cornerstone for many 3D vision tasks, enabling effective learning from
large-scale unannotated data. At the scene level, existing SSL methods often
incorporate volume rendering into the pre-training framework, using RGB-D
images as reconstruction signals to facilitate cross-modal learning. This
strategy promotes alignment between 2D and 3D modalities and enables the model
to benefit from rich visual cues in the RGB-D inputs. However, these approaches
are limited by their reliance on implicit scene representations and high memory
demands. Furthermore, since their reconstruction objectives are applied only in
2D space, they often fail to capture underlying 3D geometric structures. To
address these challenges, we propose Gaussian2Scene, a novel scene-level SSL
framework that leverages the efficiency and explicit nature of 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) for pre-training. The use of 3DGS not only alleviates the
computational burden associated with volume rendering but also supports direct
3D scene reconstruction, thereby enhancing the geometric understanding of the
backbone network. Our approach follows a progressive two-stage training
strategy. In the first stage, a dual-branch masked autoencoder learns both 2D
and 3D scene representations. In the second stage, we initialize training with
reconstructed point clouds and further supervise learning using the geometric
locations of Gaussian primitives and rendered RGB images. This process
reinforces both geometric and cross-modal learning. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of Gaussian2Scene across several downstream 3D object detection
tasks, showing consistent improvements over existing pre-training methods.

Conclusion: HomographyAD为实际工业环境中的异常检测提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) is a task that distinguishes normal and abnormal data,
which is important for applying automation technologies of the manufacturing
facilities. For MVTec dataset that is a representative AD dataset for
industrial environment, many recent works have shown remarkable performances.
However, the existing anomaly detection works have a limitation of showing good
performance for fully-aligned datasets only, unlike real-world industrial
environments. To solve this limitation, we propose HomographyAD, a novel deep
anomaly detection methodology based on the ImageNet-pretrained network, which
is specially designed for actual industrial dataset. Specifically, we first
suggest input foreground alignment using the deep homography estimation method.
In addition, we fine-tune the model by self homography learning to learn
additional shape information from normal samples. Finally, we conduct anomaly
detection based on the measure of how far the feature of test sample is from
the distribution of the extracted normal features. By applying our proposed
method to various existing AD approaches, we show performance enhancement
through extensive experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单幅图像去雾问题，通过改进的PDE框架提升去雾效果。

Method: 结合大气散射模型、非局部正则化和暗通道先验，提出改进的PDE，并通过固定点迭代和GPU加速实现高效求解。

Result: 实验证明该方法是一种有效的去雾解决方案，并可推广至深度学习模型。

Conclusion: 改进的PDE框架在单幅图像去雾中表现优异，具有推广潜力。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel partial differential equation (PDE) framework for
single-image dehazing. By integrating the atmospheric scattering model with
nonlocal regularization and dark channel prior, we propose the improved PDE: \[
-\text{div}\left(D(\nabla u)\nabla u\right) + \lambda(t) G(u) = \Phi(I,t,A) \]
where $D(\nabla u) = (|\nabla u| + \epsilon)^{-1}$ is the edge-preserving
diffusion coefficient, $G(u)$ is the Gaussian convolution operator, and
$\lambda(t)$ is the adaptive regularization parameter based on transmission map
$t$. We prove the existence and uniqueness of weak solutions in $H_0^1(\Omega)$
using Lax-Milgram theorem, and implement an efficient fixed-point iteration
scheme accelerated by PyTorch GPU computation. The experimental results
demonstrate that this method is a promising deghazing solution that can be
generalized to the deep model paradigm.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Discretized-RF是一种新的整流流（RF）模型，通过将直线路径离散化为多个可变速度子路径（动量场），解决了传统RF模型在多样性和多尺度噪声建模上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统整流流模型虽然高效，但直线路径限制了采样空间多样性，且无法有效建模多尺度噪声。

Method: 提出Discretized-RF，将路径离散化为动量场，并在速度上引入噪声以改变方向，提升多样性和噪声建模能力。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能生成多样且高效的轨迹，并持续产生高质量、多样化的结果。

Conclusion: Discretized-RF通过动量场和速度噪声的引入，显著提升了整流流模型的性能。

Abstract: Recently, the rectified flow (RF) has emerged as the new state-of-the-art
among flow-based diffusion models due to its high efficiency advantage in
straight path sampling, especially with the amazing images generated by a
series of RF models such as Flux 1.0 and SD 3.0. Although a straight-line
connection between the noisy and natural data distributions is intuitive, fast,
and easy to optimize, it still inevitably leads to: 1) Diversity concerns,
which arise since straight-line paths only cover a fairly restricted sampling
space. 2) Multi-scale noise modeling concerns, since the straight line flow
only needs to optimize the constant velocity field $\bm v$ between the two
distributions $\bm\pi_0$ and $\bm\pi_1$. In this work, we present
Discretized-RF, a new family of rectified flow (also called momentum flow
models since they refer to the previous velocity component and the random
velocity component in each diffusion step), which discretizes the straight path
into a series of variable velocity field sub-paths (namely ``momentum fields'')
to expand the search space, especially when close to the distribution
$p_\text{noise}$. Different from the previous case where noise is directly
superimposed on $\bm x$, we introduce noise on the velocity $\bm v$ of the
sub-path to change its direction in order to improve the diversity and
multi-scale noise modeling abilities. Experimental results on several
representative datasets demonstrate that learning momentum flow matching by
sampling random velocity fields will produce trajectories that are both diverse
and efficient, and can consistently generate high-quality and diverse results.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HunyuanVideo-HOMA是一个弱条件多模态驱动框架，用于提升人-物交互（HOI）视频生成的泛化能力和可控性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决HOI视频生成中对精选运动数据的依赖、对新物体/场景泛化能力有限以及可访问性受限的问题。

Method: 通过稀疏解耦运动引导增强可控性，利用多模态扩散变换器（MMDiT）编码外观和运动信号，并在共享上下文空间中融合以生成时间一致且物理合理的交互。

Result: 在弱监督下实现了交互自然性和泛化性的最先进性能，并在文本条件生成和交互式物体操作中表现出多功能性。

Conclusion: HunyuanVideo-HOMA通过创新的框架设计显著提升了HOI视频生成的质量和灵活性。

Abstract: To address key limitations in human-object interaction (HOI) video generation
-- specifically the reliance on curated motion data, limited generalization to
novel objects/scenarios, and restricted accessibility -- we introduce
HunyuanVideo-HOMA, a weakly conditioned multimodal-driven framework.
HunyuanVideo-HOMA enhances controllability and reduces dependency on precise
inputs through sparse, decoupled motion guidance. It encodes appearance and
motion signals into the dual input space of a multimodal diffusion transformer
(MMDiT), fusing them within a shared context space to synthesize temporally
consistent and physically plausible interactions. To optimize training, we
integrate a parameter-space HOI adapter initialized from pretrained MMDiT
weights, preserving prior knowledge while enabling efficient adaptation, and a
facial cross-attention adapter for anatomically accurate audio-driven lip
synchronization. Extensive experiments confirm state-of-the-art performance in
interaction naturalness and generalization under weak supervision. Finally,
HunyuanVideo-HOMA demonstrates versatility in text-conditioned generation and
interactive object manipulation, supported by a user-friendly demo interface.

### [182] [HiSin: Efficient High-Resolution Sinogram Inpainting via Resolution-Guided Progressive Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08809)
*Jiaze E,Srutarshi Banerjee,Tekin Bicer,Guannan Wang,Yanfu Zhang,Bin Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiSin是一种基于扩散模型的高效正弦图修复框架，通过分辨率引导的渐进推理减少内存和计算需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率正弦图修复对CT重建至关重要，但现有扩散模型因内存和计算需求高而受限。

Method: HiSin采用分辨率引导的渐进推理，先在低分辨率提取全局结构，再在高分辨率处理小区域，结合频率感知跳过和结构自适应步骤分配以减少冗余计算。

Result: 实验显示HiSin峰值内存使用减少31.25%，推理时间减少18.15%，且修复精度不受影响。

Conclusion: HiSin在高效性和准确性上均表现优异，适用于不同数据集、分辨率和掩码条件。

Abstract: High-resolution sinogram inpainting is essential for computed tomography
reconstruction, as missing high-frequency projections can lead to visible
artifacts and diagnostic errors. Diffusion models are well-suited for this task
due to their robustness and detail-preserving capabilities, but their
application to high-resolution inputs is limited by excessive memory and
computational demands. To address this limitation, we propose HiSin, a novel
diffusion based framework for efficient sinogram inpainting via
resolution-guided progressive inference. It progressively extracts global
structure at low resolution and defers high-resolution inference to small
patches, enabling memory-efficient inpainting. It further incorporates
frequency-aware patch skipping and structure-adaptive step allocation to reduce
redundant computation. Experimental results show that HiSin reduces peak memory
usage by up to 31.25% and inference time by up to 18.15%, and maintains
inpainting accuracy across datasets, resolutions, and mask conditions.

Abstract: Video content comprehension is essential for various applications, ranging
from video analysis to interactive systems. Despite advancements in large-scale
vision-language models (VLMs), these models often struggle to capture the
nuanced, spatiotemporal details essential for thorough video analysis. To
address this gap, we introduce Video-CoT, a groundbreaking dataset designed to

methodologies. Video-CoT contains 192,000 fine-grained spa-tiotemporal
question-answer pairs and 23,000 high-quality CoT-annotated samples, providing
a solid foundation for evaluating spatiotemporal understanding in video
comprehension. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive benchmark for assessing
these tasks, with each task featuring 750 images and tailored evaluation
metrics. Our extensive experiments reveal that current VLMs face significant
challenges in achieving satisfactory performance, high-lighting the
difficulties of effective spatiotemporal understanding. Overall, the Video-CoT
dataset and benchmark open new avenues for research in multimedia understanding
and support future innovations in intelligent systems requiring advanced video
analysis capabilities. By making these resources publicly available, we aim to
encourage further exploration in this critical area. Project

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究通过CulturalFrames基准量化了文本到图像（T2I）模型在文化表现上的不足，发现模型在显性和隐性文化期望上的失败率分别为68%和49%，且现有评估指标与人类判断相关性低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着T2I模型在视觉内容生成中的广泛应用，其能否准确反映多元文化背景成为关注点。

Method: 研究引入CulturalFrames基准，涵盖10个国家、5个社会文化领域的983个提示和3637张图像，结合超过1万条人工标注进行系统评估。

Result: T2I模型在显性和隐性文化期望上的失败率分别为68%和49%，且现有评估指标与人类判断相关性低。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了T2I模型在文化表现上的重大缺陷，为开发更具文化意识的模型和评估方法提供了方向。

Abstract: The increasing ubiquity of text-to-image (T2I) models as tools for visual
content generation raises concerns about their ability to accurately represent
diverse cultural contexts. In this work, we present the first study to
systematically quantify the alignment of T2I models and evaluation metrics with
respect to both explicit as well as implicit cultural expectations. To this
end, we introduce CulturalFrames, a novel benchmark designed for rigorous human
evaluation of cultural representation in visual generations. Spanning 10
countries and 5 socio-cultural domains, CulturalFrames comprises 983 prompts,
3637 corresponding images generated by 4 state-of-the-art T2I models, and over
10k detailed human annotations. We find that T2I models not only fail to meet
the more challenging implicit expectations but also the less challenging
explicit expectations. Across models and countries, cultural expectations are
missed an average of 44% of the time. Among these failures, explicit
expectations are missed at a surprisingly high average rate of 68%, while
implicit expectation failures are also significant, averaging 49%. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that existing T2I evaluation metrics correlate poorly with human
judgments of cultural alignment, irrespective of their internal reasoning.
Collectively, our findings expose critical gaps, providing actionable
directions for developing more culturally informed T2I models and evaluation
methodologies.

Conclusion: 研究成功开发了针对超声图像分析的领域适应方法，为医学影像处理提供了新工具。

Abstract: Medical ultrasonography is an essential imaging technique for examining
superficial organs and tissues, including lymph nodes, breast, and thyroid. It
employs high-frequency ultrasound waves to generate detailed images of the
internal structures of the human body. However, manually contouring regions of
interest in these images is a labor-intensive task that demands expertise and
often results in inconsistent interpretations among individuals.
Vision-language foundation models, which have excelled in various computer
vision applications, present new opportunities for enhancing ultrasound image
analysis. Yet, their performance is hindered by the significant differences
between natural and medical imaging domains. This research seeks to overcome
these challenges by developing domain adaptation methods for vision-language
foundation models. In this study, we explore the fine-tuning pipeline for
vision-language foundation models by utilizing large language model as text
refiner with special-designed adaptation strategies and task-driven heads. Our
approach has been extensively evaluated on six ultrasound datasets and two
tasks: segmentation and classification. The experimental results show that our
method can effectively improve the performance of vision-language foundation
models for ultrasound image analysis, and outperform the existing
state-of-the-art vision-language and pure foundation models. The source code of
this study is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空间转录组学数据获取成本高，大规模数据难以获得，因此需要一种高效的方法从现有图像数据中预测基因表达。

Method: 采用对比学习框架的深度学习方法，从全切片图像预测空间基因表达。

Result: 在六个疾病数据集上评估，预测高表达基因、高变异基因和标记基因的Pearson相关系数分别提高了6.27%、6.11%和11.26%。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅保留了基因间相关性，还适用于小样本数据集，并在癌症组织定位中显示出潜力。

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics is a technology that captures gene expression levels
at different spatial locations, widely used in tumor microenvironment analysis
and molecular profiling of histopathology, providing valuable insights into
resolving gene expression and clinical diagnosis of cancer. Due to the high
cost of data acquisition, large-scale spatial transcriptomics data remain
challenging to obtain. In this study, we develop a contrastive learning-based
deep learning method to predict spatially resolved gene expression from
whole-slide images. Evaluation across six different disease datasets
demonstrates that, compared to existing studies, our method improves Pearson
Correlation Coefficient (PCC) in the prediction of highly expressed genes,
highly variable genes, and marker genes by 6.27%, 6.11%, and 11.26%
respectively. Further analysis indicates that our method preserves gene-gene
correlations and applies to datasets with limited samples. Additionally, our
method exhibits potential in cancer tissue localization based on biomarker
expression.

TL;DR: StreamSplat是一个实时动态3D场景重建框架，通过未校准视频流生成动态3D高斯泼溅表示，解决了实时处理、动态建模和长期稳定性的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以同时处理未校准输入、动态场景建模和长期稳定性，StreamSplat旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出静态编码器中的概率采样机制和动态解码器中的双向变形场，实现高效动态建模。

Result: 在静态和动态基准测试中，StreamSplat在重建质量和动态建模方面优于现有方法，支持任意长度视频流的在线重建。

Conclusion: StreamSplat为动态3D场景重建提供了高效、稳定的解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Real-time reconstruction of dynamic 3D scenes from uncalibrated video streams
is crucial for numerous real-world applications. However, existing methods
struggle to jointly address three key challenges: 1) processing uncalibrated
inputs in real time, 2) accurately modeling dynamic scene evolution, and 3)
maintaining long-term stability and computational efficiency. To this end, we
introduce StreamSplat, the first fully feed-forward framework that transforms
uncalibrated video streams of arbitrary length into dynamic 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) representations in an online manner, capable of recovering
scene dynamics from temporally local observations. We propose two key technical
innovations: a probabilistic sampling mechanism in the static encoder for 3DGS
position prediction, and a bidirectional deformation field in the dynamic
decoder that enables robust and efficient dynamic modeling. Extensive
experiments on static and dynamic benchmarks demonstrate that StreamSplat
consistently outperforms prior works in both reconstruction quality and dynamic
scene modeling, while uniquely supporting online reconstruction of arbitrarily
long video streams. Code and models are available at

TL;DR: 论文提出DiscoVLA方法，通过同时解决视觉、语言和对齐三个差异，提升视频-文本检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注视觉差异，忽略了语言和对齐差异，导致CLIP模型在视频-文本检索中表现不足。

Method: 提出Image-Video Features Fusion整合图像和视频特征，生成伪图像标题学习细粒度对齐，并通过Image-to-Video Alignment Distillation增强视频级对齐。

Result: 在MSRVTT数据集上，DiscoVLA以50.5%的R@1得分超越之前方法1.5%。

Conclusion: DiscoVLA通过全面解决三个差异，显著提升了视频-文本检索性能。

Abstract: The parameter-efficient adaptation of the image-text pretraining model CLIP
for video-text retrieval is a prominent area of research. While CLIP is focused
on image-level vision-language matching, video-text retrieval demands
comprehensive understanding at the video level. Three key discrepancies emerge
in the transfer from image-level to video-level: vision, language, and
alignment. However, existing methods mainly focus on vision while neglecting
language and alignment. In this paper, we propose Discrepancy Reduction in
Vision, Language, and Alignment (DiscoVLA), which simultaneously mitigates all
three discrepancies. Specifically, we introduce Image-Video Features Fusion to
integrate image-level and video-level features, effectively tackling both
vision and language discrepancies. Additionally, we generate pseudo image
captions to learn fine-grained image-level alignment. To mitigate alignment
discrepancies, we propose Image-to-Video Alignment Distillation, which
leverages image-level alignment knowledge to enhance video-level alignment.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our DiscoVLA. In
particular, on MSRVTT with CLIP (ViT-B/16), DiscoVLA outperforms previous
methods by 1.5% in R@1, reaching a final score of 50.5% R@1. The code is

Method: 采用专家乘积（PoE）框架，通过退火重要性采样（AIS）从异构模型的乘积分布中采样，实现训练时无需调整的知识整合。

Result: 在图像和视频合成任务中表现出色，比单一方法更具可控性，并提供灵活的用户界面以指定视觉生成目标。

Conclusion: 该框架为整合异构模型知识提供了一种有效且灵活的方法，显著提升了生成任务的可控性和用户体验。

Abstract: Modern neural models capture rich priors and have complementary knowledge
over shared data domains, e.g., images and videos. Integrating diverse
knowledge from multiple sources -- including visual generative models, visual
language models, and sources with human-crafted knowledge such as graphics
engines and physics simulators -- remains under-explored. We propose a Product
of Experts (PoE) framework that performs inference-time knowledge composition
from heterogeneous models. This training-free approach samples from the product
distribution across experts via Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS). Our
framework shows practical benefits in image and video synthesis tasks, yielding
better controllability than monolithic methods and additionally providing
flexible user interfaces for specifying visual generation goals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统湿实验室手术培训依赖人工评估，效率低且主观性强，计算机视觉技术为自动化评估提供了可能。

Result: WetCat支持开发可解释的AI评估工具，为客观、可扩展的手术教育奠定基础。

Conclusion: WetCat为眼科培训中的自动化工作流分析和技能评估设定了新标准。

Abstract: To meet the growing demand for systematic surgical training, wetlab
environments have become indispensable platforms for hands-on practice in
ophthalmology. Yet, traditional wetlab training depends heavily on manual
performance evaluations, which are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and often
subject to variability. Recent advances in computer vision offer promising
avenues for automated skill assessment, enhancing both the efficiency and
objectivity of surgical education. Despite notable progress in ophthalmic
surgical datasets, existing resources predominantly focus on real surgeries or
isolated tasks, falling short of supporting comprehensive skill evaluation in
controlled wetlab settings. To address these limitations, we introduce WetCat,
the first dataset of wetlab cataract surgery videos specifically curated for
automated skill assessment. WetCat comprises high-resolution recordings of
surgeries performed by trainees on artificial eyes, featuring comprehensive
phase annotations and semantic segmentations of key anatomical structures.
These annotations are meticulously designed to facilitate skill assessment
during the critical capsulorhexis and phacoemulsification phases, adhering to
standardized surgical skill assessment frameworks. By focusing on these
essential phases, WetCat enables the development of interpretable, AI-driven
evaluation tools aligned with established clinical metrics. This dataset lays a
strong foundation for advancing objective, scalable surgical education and sets
a new benchmark for automated workflow analysis and skill assessment in
ophthalmology training. The dataset and annotations are publicly available in

Result: MIRAGE在分类和分割任务中优于通用和专业FMs及分割方法。

Conclusion: MIRAGE适合作为开发稳健眼科AI系统的基础，模型和评估基准已公开。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a fundamental tool for assisting
clinicians in analyzing ophthalmic images, such as optical coherence tomography
(OCT). However, developing AI models often requires extensive annotation, and
existing models tend to underperform on independent, unseen data. Foundation
models (FMs), large AI models trained on vast unlabeled datasets, have shown
promise in overcoming these challenges. Nonetheless, available FMs for
ophthalmology lack extensive validation, especially for segmentation tasks, and
focus on a single imaging modality. In this context, we propose MIRAGE, a novel
multimodal FM for the analysis of OCT and scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO)
images. Additionally, we propose a new evaluation benchmark with OCT/SLO
classification and segmentation tasks. The comparison with general and
specialized FMs and segmentation methods shows the superiority of MIRAGE in
both types of tasks, highlighting its suitability as a basis for the
development of robust AI systems for retinal OCT image analysis. Both MIRAGE
and the evaluation benchmark are publicly available:

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有双曲特征增强方法局限于封闭环境，无法处理未知类别，限制了泛化能力。

Method: 1. 使用神经ODE模块估计已知和未知类别的特征分布；2. 引入正则化保持双曲空间的数据层次结构；3. 推导双曲双增强损失的上界。

Result: 在五种开放环境任务中显著提升了双曲算法的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效增强了双曲算法在开放环境中的泛化能力。

Abstract: Feature augmentation generates novel samples in the feature space, providing
an effective way to enhance the generalization ability of learning algorithms
with hyperbolic geometry. Most hyperbolic feature augmentation is confined to
closed-environment, assuming the number of classes is fixed (\emph{i.e.}, seen
classes) and generating features only for these classes. In this paper, we
propose a hyperbolic dual feature augmentation method for open-environment,
which augments features for both seen and unseen classes in the hyperbolic
space. To obtain a more precise approximation of the real data distribution for
efficient training, (1) we adopt a neural ordinary differential equation
module, enhanced by meta-learning, estimating the feature distributions of both
seen and unseen classes; (2) we then introduce a regularizer to preserve the
latent hierarchical structures of data in the hyperbolic space; (3) we also
derive an upper bound for the hyperbolic dual augmentation loss, allowing us to
train a hyperbolic model using infinite augmentations for seen and unseen
classes. Extensive experiments on five open-environment tasks:
class-incremental learning, few-shot open-set recognition, few-shot learning,
zero-shot learning, and general image classification, demonstrate that our
method effectively enhances the performance of hyperbolic algorithms in
open-environment.

Abstract: Recent studies on Visual Autoregressive (VAR) models have highlighted that
high-frequency components, or later steps, in the generation process contribute
disproportionately to inference latency. However, the underlying computational
redundancy involved in these steps has yet to be thoroughly investigated. In
this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the VAR inference process and
identify two primary sources of inefficiency: step redundancy and unconditional
branch redundancy. To address step redundancy, we propose an automatic
step-skipping strategy that selectively omits unnecessary generation steps to
improve efficiency. For unconditional branch redundancy, we observe that the
information gap between the conditional and unconditional branches is minimal.
Leveraging this insight, we introduce unconditional branch replacement, a
technique that bypasses the unconditional branch to reduce computational cost.
Notably, we observe that the effectiveness of acceleration strategies varies
significantly across different samples. Motivated by this, we propose SkipVAR,
a sample-adaptive framework that leverages frequency information to dynamically
select the most suitable acceleration strategy for each instance. To evaluate
the role of high-frequency information, we introduce high-variation benchmark
datasets that test model sensitivity to fine details. Extensive experiments
show SkipVAR achieves over 0.88 average SSIM with up to 1.81x overall
acceleration and 2.62x speedup on the GenEval benchmark, maintaining model
quality. These results confirm the effectiveness of frequency-aware,
training-free adaptive acceleration for scalable autoregressive image
generation. Our code is available at https://github.com/fakerone-li/SkipVAR and
has been publicly released.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于注意力机制的两阶段框架，通过二进制注意力掩码限制预测区域，提高对虚假相关性和分布外背景的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决对象感知中上下文导致的偏见问题，同时满足需要上下文的任务需求。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段处理全图以发现对象部分和任务相关区域；第二阶段通过注意力掩码限制感受野，聚焦分析。

Result: 在多种基准测试中显著提升了对虚假相关性和分布外背景的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过注意力掩码和两阶段设计，有效平衡了上下文需求与对象感知的准确性。

Abstract: We introduce an attention-based method that uses learned binary attention
masks to ensure that only attended image regions influence the prediction.
Context can strongly affect object perception, sometimes leading to biased
representations, particularly when objects appear in out-of-distribution
backgrounds. At the same time, many image-level object-centric tasks require
identifying relevant regions, often requiring context. To address this
conundrum, we propose a two-stage framework: stage 1 processes the full image
to discover object parts and identify task-relevant regions, while stage 2
leverages input attention masking to restrict its receptive field to these
regions, enabling a focused analysis while filtering out potentially spurious
information. Both stages are trained jointly, allowing stage 2 to refine stage
1. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our
approach significantly improves robustness against spurious correlations and
out-of-distribution backgrounds.

Motivation: 研究动机在于探索是否可以通过搜索机制而非重新训练，从已部署的非推理模型中提取知识并诱导长推理链。

Method: 采用蒙特卡洛树搜索（MCTS）算法，通过注入子问题-子答案对到模型输出流中，将推理过程转化为搜索问题。

Result: 在三个基准测试中均观察到性能提升，其中MMMU-PRO总体提升2%，文科领域显著提升9%。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过搜索机制可以有效地从非推理模型中提取隐藏知识并生成长推理链，为现有模型的再利用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent research in vision-language models (VLMs) has centered around the
possibility of equipping them with implicit long-form chain-of-thought
reasoning -- akin to the success observed in language models -- via
distillation and reinforcement learning. But what about the non-reasoning
models already trained and deployed across the internet? Should we simply
abandon them, or is there hope for a search mechanism that can elicit hidden
knowledge and induce long reasoning traces -- without any additional training
or supervision? In this paper, we explore this possibility using a Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS)-inspired algorithm, which injects subquestion-subanswer
pairs into the model's output stream. We show that framing reasoning as a
search process -- where subquestions act as latent decisions within a broader
inference trajectory -- helps the model "connect the dots" between fragmented
knowledge and produce extended reasoning traces in non-reasoning models. We
evaluate our method across three benchmarks and observe consistent
improvements. Notably, our approach yields a 2% overall improvement on
MMMU-PRO, including a significant 9% gain in Liberal Arts.

Motivation: 在信息爆炸时代，如何高效利用大规模无标注数据并减少对高质量标注的依赖是医学影像领域的关键挑战。半监督学习通过知识转移提升性能，结合SAM-2的先验知识，提出SSS方法以优化特征支持。

Result: 在ACDC和BHSD数据集上，SSS的平均Dice分数为53.15，比现有最优方法提升+3.65。

Conclusion: SSS通过结合SAM-2和半监督学习，显著提升了医学图像分割性能，为减少标注依赖提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In the era of information explosion, efficiently leveraging large-scale
unlabeled data while minimizing the reliance on high-quality pixel-level
annotations remains a critical challenge in the field of medical imaging.
Semi-supervised learning (SSL) enhances the utilization of unlabeled data by
facilitating knowledge transfer, significantly improving the performance of
fully supervised models and emerging as a highly promising research direction
in medical image analysis. Inspired by the ability of Vision Foundation Models
(e.g., SAM-2) to provide rich prior knowledge, we propose SSS (Semi-Supervised
SAM-2), a novel approach that leverages SAM-2's robust feature extraction
capabilities to uncover latent knowledge in unlabeled medical images, thus
effectively enhancing feature support for fully supervised medical image
segmentation. Specifically, building upon the single-stream "weak-to-strong"
consistency regularization framework, this paper introduces a Discriminative
Feature Enhancement (DFE) mechanism to further explore the feature
discrepancies introduced by various data augmentation strategies across
multiple views. By leveraging feature similarity and dissimilarity across
multi-scale augmentation techniques, the method reconstructs and models the
features, thereby effectively optimizing the salient regions. Furthermore, a
prompt generator is developed that integrates Physical Constraints with a
Sliding Window (PCSW) mechanism to generate input prompts for unlabeled data,
fulfilling SAM-2's requirement for additional prompts. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method for semi-supervised medical
image segmentation on two multi-label datasets, i.e., ACDC and BHSD. Notably,
SSS achieves an average Dice score of 53.15 on BHSD, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art method by +3.65 Dice. Code will be available at

Motivation: 解决跨光谱（可见光和红外）人体识别中的挑战，探索如何通过编码相机信息提升性能，并填补现有数据集中遮挡研究的空白。

Method: 使用预训练的ViT模型，引入SIE编码相机和域信息，并在LLCM和IJB-MDF数据集上进行实验。

Result: 仅编码相机信息即可在LLCM数据集上实现最优性能，同时通过IJB-MDF数据集分析了遮挡对跨光谱识别的影响。

Conclusion: 相机信息的编码对跨光谱识别至关重要，而遮挡问题在跨光谱任务中仍需进一步研究。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated impressive performance across a
wide range of biometric tasks, including face and body recognition. In this
work, we adapt a ViT model pretrained on visible (VIS) imagery to the
challenging problem of cross-spectral body recognition, which involves matching
images captured in the visible and infrared (IR) domains. Recent ViT
architectures have explored incorporating additional embeddings beyond
traditional positional embeddings. Building on this idea, we integrate Side
Information Embedding (SIE) and examine the impact of encoding domain and
camera information to enhance cross-spectral matching. Surprisingly, our
results show that encoding only camera information - without explicitly
incorporating domain information - achieves state-of-the-art performance on the
LLCM dataset. While occlusion handling has been extensively studied in
visible-spectrum person re-identification (Re-ID), occlusions in
visible-infrared (VI) Re-ID remain largely underexplored - primarily because
existing VI-ReID datasets, such as LLCM, SYSU-MM01, and RegDB, predominantly
feature full-body, unoccluded images. To address this gap, we analyze the
impact of range-induced occlusions using the IARPA Janus Benchmark Multi-Domain
Face (IJB-MDF) dataset, which provides a diverse set of visible and infrared
images captured at various distances, enabling cross-range, cross-spectral
evaluations.

Motivation: 隐蔽物体分割任务因不完全标注数据和物体与背景的相似性而极具挑战性，需要一种统一方法来解决这些问题。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多个ISCOS任务中达到最先进性能，并可作为即插即用方案提升现有模型。

Conclusion: SEE方法有效解决了ISCOS任务中的关键挑战，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Incompletely-Supervised Concealed Object Segmentation (ISCOS) involves
segmenting objects that seamlessly blend into their surrounding environments,
utilizing incompletely annotated data, such as weak and semi-annotations, for
model training. This task remains highly challenging due to (1) the limited
supervision provided by the incompletely annotated training data, and (2) the
difficulty of distinguishing concealed objects from the background, which
arises from the intrinsic similarities in concealed scenarios. In this paper,
we introduce the first unified method for ISCOS to address these challenges. To
tackle the issue of incomplete supervision, we propose a unified mean-teacher
framework, SEE, that leverages the vision foundation model, ``\emph{Segment
Anything Model (SAM)}'', to generate pseudo-labels using coarse masks produced
by the teacher model as prompts. To mitigate the effect of low-quality
segmentation masks, we introduce a series of strategies for pseudo-label
generation, storage, and supervision. These strategies aim to produce
informative pseudo-labels, store the best pseudo-labels generated, and select
the most reliable components to guide the student model, thereby ensuring
robust network training. Additionally, to tackle the issue of intrinsic
similarity, we design a hybrid-granularity feature grouping module that groups
features at different granularities and aggregates these results. By clustering
similar features, this module promotes segmentation coherence, facilitating
more complete segmentation for both single-object and multiple-object images.
We validate the effectiveness of our approach across multiple ISCOS tasks, and
experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance. Furthermore, SEE can serve as a plug-and-play solution, enhancing
the performance of existing models.

Abstract: In recent years, there has been tremendous progress in object detection
performance. However, despite these advances, the detection performance for
small objects is significantly inferior to that of large objects. Detecting
small objects is one of the most challenging and important problems in computer
vision. To improve the detection performance for small objects, we propose an
optimal data augmentation method using Fast AutoAugment. Through our proposed
method, we can quickly find optimal augmentation policies that can overcome
degradation when detecting small objects, and we achieve a 20% performance
improvement on the DOTA dataset.

Result: ORIDa是首个公开的具有如此规模和复杂性的真实世界图像合成数据集。

Conclusion: ORIDa为对象合成研究的进一步推进提供了宝贵资源。

Abstract: Object compositing, the task of placing and harmonizing objects in images of
diverse visual scenes, has become an important task in computer vision with the
rise of generative models. However, existing datasets lack the diversity and
scale required to comprehensively explore real-world scenarios. We introduce
ORIDa (Object-centric Real-world Image Composition Dataset), a large-scale,
real-captured dataset containing over 30,000 images featuring 200 unique
objects, each of which is presented across varied positions and scenes. ORIDa
has two types of data: factual-counterfactual sets and factual-only scenes. The
factual-counterfactual sets consist of four factual images showing an object in
different positions within a scene and a single counterfactual (or background)
image of the scene without the object, resulting in five images per scene. The
factual-only scenes include a single image containing an object in a specific
context, expanding the variety of environments. To our knowledge, ORIDa is the
first publicly available dataset with its scale and complexity for real-world
image composition. Extensive analysis and experiments highlight the value of
ORIDa as a resource for advancing further research in object compositing.

TL;DR: ADAM是一种无需训练的自发现与标注模型，利用大语言模型和视觉嵌入技术，在开放世界中为未知对象生成标签。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统目标检测模型依赖预定义类别，无法识别开放世界中的新对象，ADAM旨在解决这一问题。

Method: ADAM结合大语言模型生成候选标签，并使用CLIP视觉嵌入构建Embedding-Label Repository（ELR），通过频率投票和跨模态重排为新对象分配标签。此外，引入自优化循环提升标签一致性。

Result: 在COCO和PASCAL数据集上的实验表明，ADAM无需微调即可有效标注新类别。

Conclusion: ADAM为开放世界目标标注提供了一种无需训练的高效解决方案。

Abstract: Object detection models typically rely on predefined categories, limiting
their ability to identify novel objects in open-world scenarios. To overcome
this constraint, we introduce ADAM: Autonomous Discovery and Annotation Model,
a training-free, self-refining framework for open-world object labeling. ADAM
leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate candidate labels for unknown
objects based on contextual information from known entities within a scene.
These labels are paired with visual embeddings from CLIP to construct an
Embedding-Label Repository (ELR) that enables inference without category
supervision. For a newly encountered unknown object, ADAM retrieves visually
similar instances from the ELR and applies frequency-based voting and
cross-modal re-ranking to assign a robust label. To further enhance
consistency, we introduce a self-refinement loop that re-evaluates repository
labels using visual cohesion analysis and k-nearest-neighbor-based majority
re-labeling. Experimental results on the COCO and PASCAL datasets demonstrate
that ADAM effectively annotates novel categories using only visual and
contextual signals, without requiring any fine-tuning or retraining.

Motivation: 范围视图方法在LiDAR分割中因其高效性而流行，但在恶劣天气下的泛化性能不足，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 提出了一种双分支框架，包括几何异常抑制模块（GAS）和反射失真校准模块（RDC），分别处理空间噪声和反射失真。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了模型在恶劣天气下的泛化能力，且推理开销极小。

Conclusion: 该框架为实际LiDAR分割提供了一种实用且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: LiDAR segmentation has emerged as an important task to enrich multimedia
experiences and analysis. Range-view-based methods have gained popularity due
to their high computational efficiency and compatibility with real-time
deployment. However, their generalized performance under adverse weather
conditions remains underexplored, limiting their reliability in real-world
environments. In this work, we identify and analyze the unique challenges that
affect the generalization of range-view LiDAR segmentation in severe weather.
To address these challenges, we propose a modular and lightweight framework
that enhances robustness without altering the core architecture of existing
models. Our method reformulates the initial stem block of standard range-view
networks into two branches to process geometric attributes and reflectance
intensity separately. Specifically, a Geometric Abnormality Suppression (GAS)
module reduces the influence of weather-induced spatial noise, and a
Reflectance Distortion Calibration (RDC) module corrects reflectance
distortions through memory-guided adaptive instance normalization. The
processed features are then fused and passed to the original segmentation
pipeline. Extensive experiments on different benchmarks and baseline models
demonstrate that our approach significantly improves generalization to adverse
weather with minimal inference overhead, offering a practical and effective
solution for real-world LiDAR segmentation.

Motivation: 传统跨模态对比学习方法在视觉表示能力上表现不佳，而多模态掩码建模模型在视觉表示上表现优异但在跨模态匹配上不足。ALTA旨在解决这一矛盾。

Method: ALTA通过适应预训练的视觉模型（来自掩码记录建模），仅需约8%的可训练参数和不到1/5的计算消耗，同时整合了时间多视角放射图像输入以增强一致性。

Result: ALTA在文本到图像和图像到文本检索任务中分别比最佳对比方法高出4%和6%的绝对准确率。

Conclusion: ALTA不仅提升了视觉-语言对齐任务的性能，还促进了视觉和语言理解的提升。

Abstract: Medical vision-language alignment through cross-modal contrastive learning
shows promising performance in image-text matching tasks, such as retrieval and
zero-shot classification. However, conventional cross-modal contrastive
learning (CLIP-based) methods suffer from suboptimal visual representation
capabilities, which also limits their effectiveness in vision-language
alignment. In contrast, although the models pretrained via multimodal masked
modeling struggle with direct cross-modal matching, they excel in visual
representation. To address this contradiction, we propose ALTA (ALign Through
Adapting), an efficient medical vision-language alignment method that utilizes
only about 8% of the trainable parameters and less than 1/5 of the
computational consumption required for masked record modeling. ALTA achieves
superior performance in vision-language matching tasks like retrieval and
zero-shot classification by adapting the pretrained vision model from masked
record modeling. Additionally, we integrate temporal-multiview radiograph
inputs to enhance the information consistency between radiographs and their
corresponding descriptions in reports, further improving the vision-language
alignment. Experimental evaluations show that ALTA outperforms the
best-performing counterpart by over 4% absolute points in text-to-image
accuracy and approximately 6% absolute points in image-to-text retrieval
accuracy. The adaptation of vision-language models during efficient alignment
also promotes better vision and language understanding. Code is publicly

TL;DR: 本文探讨了扩散式文本到图像（T2I）和图像到图像（I2I）模型中概念替换技术（CRTs）的局限性，提出了一种新的方法AntiMirror，以在替换不可接受概念的同时保持输入的其他概念。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管生成模型（如T2I）在避免生成不可接受内容（如冒犯性或版权内容）方面取得了一定成功，但现有CRTs在I2I场景中效果不佳，且忽视了替换概念时的保真度问题。

Method: 作者首先通过I2I模型实证了现有CRTs的不足，随后提出了一种结合目标图像编辑技术的新方法AntiMirror，以同时实现替换效果和保真度。

Result: 实验表明，AntiMirror在替换不可接受概念的同时，能够更好地保留输入的其他概念，证明了其有效性。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了T2I和I2I场景中CRTs的差异，并提出了一种更全面的解决方案AntiMirror，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Generative models, particularly diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models,
have demonstrated astounding success. However, aligning them to avoid
generating content with unacceptable concepts (e.g., offensive or copyrighted
content, or celebrity likenesses) remains a significant challenge. Concept
replacement techniques (CRTs) aim to address this challenge, often by trying to
"erase" unacceptable concepts from models. Recently, model providers have
started offering image editing services which accept an image and a text prompt
as input, to produce an image altered as specified by the prompt. These are
known as image-to-image (I2I) models. In this paper, we first use an I2I model
to empirically demonstrate that today's state-of-the-art CRTs do not in fact
erase unacceptable concepts. Existing CRTs are thus likely to be ineffective in
emerging I2I scenarios, despite their proven ability to remove unwanted
concepts in T2I pipelines, highlighting the need to understand this discrepancy
between T2I and I2I settings. Next, we argue that a good CRT, while replacing
unacceptable concepts, should preserve other concepts specified in the inputs
to generative models. We call this fidelity. Prior work on CRTs have neglected
fidelity in the case of unacceptable concepts. Finally, we propose the use of
targeted image-editing techniques to achieve both effectiveness and fidelity.
We present such a technique, AntiMirror, and demonstrate its viability.

Conclusion: SDTagNet通过充分利用SD地图信息，显著提升了在线高精地图构建的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles rely on detailed and accurate environmental information
to operate safely. High definition (HD) maps offer a promising solution, but
their high maintenance cost poses a significant barrier to scalable deployment.
This challenge is addressed by online HD map construction methods, which
generate local HD maps from live sensor data. However, these methods are
inherently limited by the short perception range of onboard sensors. To
overcome this limitation and improve general performance, recent approaches
have explored the use of standard definition (SD) maps as prior, which are
significantly easier to maintain. We propose SDTagNet, the first online HD map
construction method that fully utilizes the information of widely available SD
maps, like OpenStreetMap, to enhance far range detection accuracy. Our approach
introduces two key innovations. First, in contrast to previous work, we
incorporate not only polyline SD map data with manually selected classes, but
additional semantic information in the form of textual annotations. In this
way, we enrich SD vector map tokens with NLP-derived features, eliminating the
dependency on predefined specifications or exhaustive class taxonomies. Second,
we introduce a point-level SD map encoder together with orthogonal element
identifiers to uniformly integrate all types of map elements. Experiments on
Argoverse 2 and nuScenes show that this boosts map perception performance by up
to +5.9 mAP (+45%) w.r.t. map construction without priors and up to +3.2 mAP
(+20%) w.r.t. previous approaches that already use SD map priors. Code is

supervised clinical datasets. In contrast to fields such as NLP and
conventional computer vision, where transfer learning is widely used to address
data scarcity, the transferability of MIL models remains poorly understood. In
this study, we systematically evaluate the transfer learning capabilities of
pretrained MIL models by assessing 11 models across 21 pretraining tasks for
morphological and molecular subtype prediction. Our results show that
pretrained MIL models, even when trained on different organs than the target
task, consistently outperform models trained from scratch. Moreover,
pretraining on pancancer datasets enables strong generalization across organs
and tasks, outperforming slide foundation models while using substantially less
pretraining data. These findings highlight the robust adaptability of MIL
models and demonstrate the benefits of leveraging transfer learning to boost
performance in CPath. Lastly, we provide a resource which standardizes the
implementation of MIL models and collection of pretrained model weights on
popular CPath tasks, available at https://github.com/mahmoodlab/MIL-Lab

### [208] [DIsoN: Decentralized Isolation Networks for Out-of-Distribution Detection in Medical Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09024)
*Felix Wagner,Pramit Saha,Harry Anthony,J. Alison Noble,Konstantinos Kamnitsas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DIsoN的去中心化OOD检测框架，解决了训练数据无法共享时的OOD检测问题，并在医疗影像数据上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在安全关键领域（如医疗影像）部署ML模型时，需要检测训练数据中未见的输入（OOD），但现有方法要么丢弃训练数据，要么假设测试数据与训练数据集中存储，这在现实中难以实现。

Method: 提出Isolation Network框架，通过解决二分类任务量化测试样本与训练数据的分离难度；进一步提出DIsoN，在不共享数据的情况下，通过交换模型参数实现训练与测试数据的比较。

Result: 在四个医疗影像数据集上的12个OOD检测任务中，DIsoN表现优于现有方法，同时保护数据隐私。

Conclusion: DIsoN为ML开发者提供了一种新的服务模式，即在不共享数据的情况下，远程安全地利用训练数据进行OOD检测。

Abstract: Safe deployment of machine learning (ML) models in safety-critical domains
such as medical imaging requires detecting inputs with characteristics not seen
during training, known as out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, to prevent
unreliable predictions. Effective OOD detection after deployment could benefit
from access to the training data, enabling direct comparison between test
samples and the training data distribution to identify differences.
State-of-the-art OOD detection methods, however, either discard training data
after deployment or assume that test samples and training data are centrally
stored together, an assumption that rarely holds in real-world settings. This
is because shipping training data with the deployed model is usually impossible
due to the size of training databases, as well as proprietary or privacy
constraints. We introduce the Isolation Network, an OOD detection framework
that quantifies the difficulty of separating a target test sample from the
training data by solving a binary classification task. We then propose
Decentralized Isolation Networks (DIsoN), which enables the comparison of
training and test data when data-sharing is impossible, by exchanging only
model parameters between the remote computational nodes of training and
deployment. We further extend DIsoN with class-conditioning, comparing a target
sample solely with training data of its predicted class. We evaluate DIsoN on
four medical imaging datasets (dermatology, chest X-ray, breast ultrasound,
histopathology) across 12 OOD detection tasks. DIsoN performs favorably against
existing methods while respecting data-privacy. This decentralized OOD
detection framework opens the way for a new type of service that ML developers
could provide along with their models: providing remote, secure utilization of
their training data for OOD detection services. Code will be available upon

*Runqian Wang,Kaiming He*

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为“Dispersive Loss”的简单即插即用正则化方法，用于改进扩散生成模型，无需额外数据或参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散生成模型通常缺乏显式正则化，且与表示学习进展脱节。本文旨在通过一种自包含的方法弥合这一差距。

Method: 提出Dispersive Loss，通过鼓励隐藏空间中的表示分散来正则化模型，无需正样本对或干扰回归采样过程。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上的实验表明，该方法在多种模型中均能稳定提升性能。

Conclusion: Dispersive Loss为生成模型与表示学习之间的桥梁提供了一种简洁有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The development of diffusion-based generative models over the past decade has
largely proceeded independently of progress in representation learning. These
diffusion models typically rely on regression-based objectives and generally
lack explicit regularization. In this work, we propose \textit{Dispersive
Loss}, a simple plug-and-play regularizer that effectively improves
diffusion-based generative models. Our loss function encourages internal
representations to disperse in the hidden space, analogous to contrastive
self-supervised learning, with the key distinction that it requires no positive
sample pairs and therefore does not interfere with the sampling process used
for regression. Compared to the recent method of representation alignment
(REPA), our approach is self-contained and minimalist, requiring no
pre-training, no additional parameters, and no external data. We evaluate
Dispersive Loss on the ImageNet dataset across a range of models and report
consistent improvements over widely used and strong baselines. We hope our work
will help bridge the gap between generative modeling and representation
learning.

Abstract: We introduce Princeton365, a large-scale diverse dataset of 365 videos with
accurate camera pose. Our dataset bridges the gap between accuracy and data
diversity in current SLAM benchmarks by introducing a novel ground truth
collection framework that leverages calibration boards and a 360-camera. We
collect indoor, outdoor, and object scanning videos with synchronized monocular
and stereo RGB video outputs as well as IMU. We further propose a new scene
scale-aware evaluation metric for SLAM based on the the optical flow induced by
the camera pose estimation error. In contrast to the current metrics, our new
metric allows for comparison between the performance of SLAM methods across
scenes as opposed to existing metrics such as Average Trajectory Error (ATE),
allowing researchers to analyze the failure modes of their methods. We also
propose a challenging Novel View Synthesis benchmark that covers cases not
covered by current NVS benchmarks, such as fully non-Lambertian scenes with
360-degree camera trajectories. Please visit

### [211] [Autoregressive Semantic Visual Reconstruction Helps VLMs Understand Better](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09040)
*Dianyi Wang,Wei Song,Yikun Wang,Siyuan Wang,Kaicheng Yu,Zhongyu Wei,Jiaqi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ASVR的方法，通过自回归框架联合学习视觉和文本模态，解决了现有大视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在视觉模态学习中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LVLMs仅对文本序列进行自回归监督，未充分利用视觉模态，导致无法处理无标注图像、遗漏关键视觉细节及难以表达视觉中心内容等问题。

Method: 提出ASVR方法，通过自回归重建图像的语义表示而非原始视觉外观，提升多模态理解能力。

Result: 实验表明，ASVR在多种数据规模和LLM骨干网络上均表现优异，如在14个多模态基准测试中将LLaVA-1.5平均分提升5%。

Conclusion: ASVR通过自回归语义视觉重建，显著提升了多模态理解能力，为视觉语言模型的发展提供了新思路。

Abstract: Typical large vision-language models (LVLMs) apply autoregressive supervision
solely to textual sequences, without fully incorporating the visual modality
into the learning process. This results in three key limitations: (1) an
inability to utilize images without accompanying captions, (2) the risk that
captions omit critical visual details, and (3) the challenge that certain
vision-centric content cannot be adequately conveyed through text. As a result,
current LVLMs often prioritize vision-to-language alignment while potentially
overlooking fine-grained visual information. While some prior works have
explored autoregressive image generation, effectively leveraging autoregressive
visual supervision to enhance image understanding remains an open challenge. In
this paper, we introduce Autoregressive Semantic Visual Reconstruction (ASVR),
which enables joint learning of visual and textual modalities within a unified
autoregressive framework. We show that autoregressively reconstructing the raw
visual appearance of images does not enhance and may even impair multimodal
understanding. In contrast, autoregressively reconstructing the semantic
representation of images consistently improves comprehension. Notably, we find
that even when models are given continuous image features as input, they can
effectively reconstruct discrete semantic tokens, resulting in stable and
consistent improvements across a wide range of multimodal understanding
benchmarks. Our approach delivers significant performance gains across varying
data scales (556k-2M) and types of LLM bacbones. Specifically, ASVR improves
LLaVA-1.5 by 5% in average scores across 14 multimodal benchmarks. The code is
available at https://github.com/AlenjandroWang/ASVR.

Motivation: 收集和标注真实世界数据用于自动驾驶系统（AV）等安全关键物理AI系统既耗时又昂贵，尤其是难以捕捉对训练和测试至关重要的罕见边缘案例。

Method: 利用NVIDIA Cosmos世界基础模型专门为驾驶领域开发的Cosmos-Drive模型套件，生成可控、高保真、多视角且时空一致的驾驶视频。

Abstract: Collecting and annotating real-world data for safety-critical physical AI
systems, such as Autonomous Vehicle (AV), is time-consuming and costly. It is
especially challenging to capture rare edge cases, which play a critical role
in training and testing of an AV system. To address this challenge, we
introduce the Cosmos-Drive-Dreams - a synthetic data generation (SDG) pipeline
that aims to generate challenging scenarios to facilitate downstream tasks such
as perception and driving policy training. Powering this pipeline is
Cosmos-Drive, a suite of models specialized from NVIDIA Cosmos world foundation
model for the driving domain and are capable of controllable, high-fidelity,
multi-view, and spatiotemporally consistent driving video generation. We
showcase the utility of these models by applying Cosmos-Drive-Dreams to scale
the quantity and diversity of driving datasets with high-fidelity and
challenging scenarios. Experimentally, we demonstrate that our generated data
helps in mitigating long-tail distribution problems and enhances generalization
in downstream tasks such as 3D lane detection, 3D object detection and driving
policy learning. We open source our pipeline toolkit, dataset and model weights
through the NVIDIA's Cosmos platform.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于统一幅度规律的视频扩散模型加速方法MagCache，通过自适应跳过不重要时间步和缓存策略，显著提升了速度并保持了视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频扩散模型加速技术依赖均匀启发式或时间嵌入变体，需大量校准且易因提示特定过拟合导致输出不一致。

Method: 发现不同模型和提示下残差输出幅度比单调稳定下降的规律，提出MagCache，利用误差建模机制和自适应缓存策略跳过不重要时间步。

Result: MagCache在Open-Sora和Wan 2.1上分别实现2.1倍和2.68倍加速，且在LPIPS、SSIM和PSNR指标上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MagCache是一种高效且鲁棒的加速方法，仅需单样本校准，显著提升了视频扩散模型的性能和效率。

Abstract: Existing acceleration techniques for video diffusion models often rely on
uniform heuristics or time-embedding variants to skip timesteps and reuse
cached features. These approaches typically require extensive calibration with
curated prompts and risk inconsistent outputs due to prompt-specific
overfitting. In this paper, we introduce a novel and robust discovery: a
unified magnitude law observed across different models and prompts.
Specifically, the magnitude ratio of successive residual outputs decreases
monotonically and steadily in most timesteps while rapidly in the last several
steps. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a Magnitude-aware Cache (MagCache)
that adaptively skips unimportant timesteps using an error modeling mechanism
and adaptive caching strategy. Unlike existing methods requiring dozens of
curated samples for calibration, MagCache only requires a single sample for
calibration. Experimental results show that MagCache achieves 2.1x and 2.68x
speedups on Open-Sora and Wan 2.1, respectively, while preserving superior
visual fidelity. It significantly outperforms existing methods in LPIPS, SSIM,
and PSNR, under comparable computational budgets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原子模拟在化学和材料科学中至关重要，但因其复杂性、多样化的计算方法和软件生态系统，以及需要专业知识，导致执行困难。

Method: ChemGraph利用图神经网络基础模型进行高效计算，结合大型语言模型（LLMs）进行任务规划和科学推理，提供交互式界面。

Result: 在13个基准任务中评估表明，小型LLMs适用于简单任务，复杂任务需更大模型；多代理框架分解任务可提升小型模型性能。

Conclusion: ChemGraph通过AI和自动化显著简化了原子模拟工作流程，展示了多代理框架在提升小型模型性能方面的潜力。

Abstract: Atomistic simulations are essential tools in chemistry and materials science,
accelerating the discovery of novel catalysts, energy storage materials, and
pharmaceuticals. However, running these simulations remains challenging due to
the wide range of computational methods, diverse software ecosystems, and the
need for expert knowledge and manual effort for the setup, execution, and
validation stages. In this work, we present ChemGraph, an agentic framework
powered by artificial intelligence and state-of-the-art simulation tools to
streamline and automate computational chemistry and materials science
workflows. ChemGraph leverages graph neural network-based foundation models for
accurate yet computationally efficient calculations and large language models
(LLMs) for natural language understanding, task planning, and scientific
reasoning to provide an intuitive and interactive interface. Users can perform
tasks such as molecular structure generation, single-point energy, geometry
optimization, vibrational analysis, and thermochemistry calculations with
methods ranging from tight-binding and machine learning interatomic potentials
to density functional theory or wave function theory-based methods. We evaluate
ChemGraph across 13 benchmark tasks and demonstrate that smaller LLMs
(GPT-4o-mini, Claude-3.5-haiku, Qwen2.5-14B) perform well on simple workflows,
while more complex tasks benefit from using larger models like GPT-4o.
Importantly, we show that decomposing complex tasks into smaller subtasks
through a multi-agent framework enables smaller LLM models to match or exceed
GPT-4o's performance in specific scenarios.

TL;DR: 论文研究了max-normalized R-CDT和mean-normalized R-CDT两种特征提取器，用于解决图像分类任务中非仿射变形和脉冲噪声的鲁棒性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现实应用中，图像数据常受非仿射变形和噪声影响，需要一种鲁棒的特征提取方法。

Method: 提出了max-normalized和mean-normalized R-CDT，分别基于Wasserstein-infinity和Wasserstein-2距离，分析其鲁棒性。

Result: 理论分析和数值实验表明，这两种方法在非仿射变形和脉冲噪声下仍能保持分类的线性可分性。

Conclusion: max-normalized和mean-normalized R-CDT是有效的特征提取器，适用于复杂变形和噪声环境下的图像分类。

Abstract: The Radon cumulative distribution transform (R-CDT), is an easy-to-compute
feature extractor that facilitates image classification tasks especially in the
small data regime. It is closely related to the sliced Wasserstein distance and
provably guaranties the linear separability of image classes that emerge from
translations or scalings. In many real-world applications, like the recognition
of watermarks in filigranology, however, the data is subject to general affine
transformations originating from the measurement process. To overcome this
issue, we recently introduced the so-called max-normalized R-CDT that only
requires elementary operations and guaranties the separability under arbitrary
affine transformations. The aim of this paper is to continue our study of the
max-normalized R-CDT especially with respect to its robustness against
non-affine image deformations. Our sensitivity analysis shows that its
separability properties are stable provided the Wasserstein-infinity distance
between the samples can be controlled. Since the Wasserstein-infinity distance
only allows small local image deformations, we moreover introduce a
mean-normalized version of the R-CDT. In this case, robustness relates to the
Wasserstein-2 distance and also covers image deformations caused by impulsive
noise for instance. Our theoretical results are supported by numerical
experiments showing the effectiveness of our novel feature extractors as well
as their robustness against local non-affine deformations and impulsive noise.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于LLM的SQL查询重写系统QUITE，通过多智能体框架和实时反馈解决规则方法的局限性，显著提升查询性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 规则方法在SQL查询重写中覆盖范围有限且难以扩展，而LLM具备接近人类的语义和推理能力，但直接应用易产生错误。

Method: 设计多智能体框架（基于FSM）、重写中间件和提示注入技术，结合实时数据库反馈优化查询。

Result: QUITE比现有方法减少35.8%执行时间，覆盖更多查询模式，重写数量增加24.1%。

Conclusion: QUITE通过LLM和反馈机制有效扩展了查询重写能力，显著优于传统规则方法。

Abstract: Query rewrite transforms SQL queries into semantically equivalent forms that
run more efficiently. Existing approaches mainly rely on predefined rewrite
rules, but they handle a limited subset of queries and can cause performance
regressions. This limitation stems from three challenges of rule-based query
rewrite: (1) it is hard to discover and verify new rules, (2) fixed rewrite
rules do not generalize to new query patterns, and (3) some rewrite techniques
cannot be expressed as fixed rules. Motivated by the fact that human experts
exhibit significantly better rewrite ability but suffer from scalability, and
Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated nearly human-level semantic and
reasoning abilities, we propose a new approach of using LLMs to rewrite SQL
queries beyond rules. Due to the hallucination problems in LLMs, directly
applying LLMs often leads to nonequivalent and suboptimal queries. To address
this issue, we propose QUITE (query rewrite), a training-free and
feedback-aware system based on LLM agents that rewrites SQL queries into
semantically equivalent forms with significantly better performance, covering a
broader range of query patterns and rewrite strategies compared to rule-based
methods. Firstly, we design a multi-agent framework controlled by a finite
state machine (FSM) to equip LLMs with the ability to use external tools and
enhance the rewrite process with real-time database feedback. Secondly, we
develop a rewrite middleware to enhance the ability of LLMs to generate
optimized query equivalents. Finally, we employ a novel hint injection
technique to improve execution plans for rewritten queries. Extensive
experiments show that QUITE reduces query execution time by up to 35.8% over
state-of-the-art approaches and produces 24.1% more rewrites than prior
methods, covering query cases that earlier systems did not handle.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型在自主数据分析中的应用日益广泛，但其对数据异常（如缺失值、离群值等）的识别和处理能力尚未充分研究，这可能影响分析结论的有效性。

Method: 通过程序化扰动模拟数据异常，构建了包含2980个表格查询对的RADAR基准测试，覆盖9个领域和5种数据异常类型。

Result: 前沿模型在无数据异常时表现尚可，但在数据异常存在时性能显著下降，暴露了其在数据感知分析中的不足。

Conclusion: RADAR为提升表格推理能力提供了灵活且可扩展的资源，有助于推动数据感知分析的研究。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are increasingly being deployed to perform autonomous
data analyses. However, their data awareness -- the ability to recognize,
reason over, and appropriately handle data artifacts such as missing values,
outliers, and logical inconsistencies -- remains underexplored. These artifacts
are especially common in real-world tabular data and, if mishandled, can
significantly compromise the validity of analytical conclusions. To address
this gap, we present RADAR, a benchmark for systematically evaluating
data-aware reasoning on tabular data. We develop a framework to simulate data
artifacts via programmatic perturbations to enable targeted evaluation of model
behavior. RADAR comprises 2980 table query pairs, grounded in real-world data
spanning 9 domains and 5 data artifact types. In addition to evaluating
artifact handling, RADAR systematically varies table size to study how
reasoning performance holds when increasing table size. Our evaluation reveals
that, despite decent performance on tables without data artifacts, frontier
models degrade significantly when data artifacts are introduced, exposing
critical gaps in their capacity for robust, data-aware analysis. Designed to be
flexible and extensible, RADAR supports diverse perturbation types and
controllable table sizes, offering a valuable resource for advancing tabular
reasoning.

Abstract: Financial analysis presents complex challenges that could leverage large
language model (LLM) capabilities. However, the scarcity of challenging
financial datasets, particularly for Japanese financial data, impedes academic
innovation in financial analytics. As LLMs advance, this lack of accessible
research resources increasingly hinders their development and evaluation in
this specialized domain. To address this gap, we introduce EDINET-Bench, an
open-source Japanese financial benchmark designed to evaluate the performance
of LLMs on challenging financial tasks including accounting fraud detection,
earnings forecasting, and industry prediction. EDINET-Bench is constructed by
downloading annual reports from the past 10 years from Japan's Electronic
Disclosure for Investors' NETwork (EDINET) and automatically assigning labels
corresponding to each evaluation task. Our experiments reveal that even
state-of-the-art LLMs struggle, performing only slightly better than logistic
regression in binary classification for fraud detection and earnings
forecasting. These results highlight significant challenges in applying LLMs to
real-world financial applications and underscore the need for domain-specific
adaptation. Our dataset, benchmark construction code, and evaluation code is

Abstract: Ferroelectric polarization switching underpins the functional performance of
a wide range of materials and devices, yet its dependence on complex local
microstructural features renders systematic exploration by manual or grid-based
spectroscopic measurements impractical. Here, we introduce a multi-objective
kernel-learning workflow that infers the microstructural rules governing
switching behavior directly from high-resolution imaging data. Applied to
automated piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) experiments, our framework
efficiently identifies the key relationships between domain-wall configurations
and local switching kinetics, revealing how specific wall geometries and defect
distributions modulate polarization reversal. Post-experiment analysis projects
abstract reward functions, such as switching ease and domain symmetry, onto
physically interpretable descriptors including domain configuration and
proximity to boundaries. This enables not only high-throughput active learning,
but also mechanistic insight into the microstructural control of switching
phenomena. While demonstrated for ferroelectric domain switching, our approach
provides a powerful, generalizable tool for navigating complex,
non-differentiable design spaces, from structure-property correlations in
molecular discovery to combinatorial optimization across diverse imaging
modalities.

Abstract: Recent voxel-wise multimodal brain encoding studies have shown that
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit a higher degree of brain
alignment compared to unimodal models in both unimodal and multimodal stimulus
settings. More recently, instruction-tuned multimodal models have shown to
generate task-specific representations that align strongly with brain activity.
However, prior work evaluating the brain alignment of MLLMs has primarily
focused on unimodal settings or relied on non-instruction-tuned multimodal
models for multimodal stimuli. To address this gap, we investigated brain
alignment, that is, measuring the degree of predictivity of neural activity
recorded while participants were watching naturalistic movies (video along with
audio) with representations derived from MLLMs. We utilized
instruction-specific embeddings from six video and two audio instruction-tuned
MLLMs. Experiments with 13 video task-specific instructions show that
instruction-tuned video MLLMs significantly outperform non-instruction-tuned
multimodal (by 15%) and unimodal models (by 20%). Our evaluation of MLLMs for
both video and audio tasks using language-guided instructions shows clear
disentanglement in task-specific representations from MLLMs, leading to precise
differentiation of multimodal functional processing in the brain. We also find
that MLLM layers align hierarchically with the brain, with early sensory areas
showing strong alignment with early layers, while higher-level visual and
language regions align more with middle to late layers. These findings provide
clear evidence for the role of task-specific instructions in improving the
alignment between brain activity and MLLMs, and open new avenues for mapping
joint information processing in both the systems. We make the code publicly
available [https://github.com/subbareddy248/mllm_videos].

### [221] [A System for Accurate Tracking and Video Recordings of Rodent Eye Movements using Convolutional Neural Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08183)
*Isha Puri,David Cox*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于卷积神经网络的高精度、灵活的啮齿类动物瞳孔和角膜反射识别方法，解决了现有技术未考虑啮齿类动物眼睛独特特性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有眼动追踪技术主要针对人类眼睛，未考虑啮齿类动物眼睛的特殊性（如参数变异、毛发干扰、尺寸小等），亟需一种适应这些特性的新方法。

Method: 采用可增量训练的卷积神经网络架构，结合自动化红外视频眼动记录系统，实现高精度的瞳孔和角膜反射识别。

Result: 该方法首次展示了高精度的生物医学图像分割技术，为啮齿类动物眼动追踪提供了先进工具。

Conclusion: 结合自动化红外视频系统，该方法为神经科学和视觉科学研究提供了最先进的啮齿类动物眼动追踪技术。

Abstract: Research in neuroscience and vision science relies heavily on careful
measurements of animal subject's gaze direction. Rodents are the most widely
studied animal subjects for such research because of their economic advantage
and hardiness. Recently, video based eye trackers that use image processing
techniques have become a popular option for gaze tracking because they are easy
to use and are completely noninvasive. Although significant progress has been
made in improving the accuracy and robustness of eye tracking algorithms,
unfortunately, almost all of the techniques have focused on human eyes, which
does not account for the unique characteristics of the rodent eye images, e.g.,
variability in eye parameters, abundance of surrounding hair, and their small
size. To overcome these unique challenges, this work presents a flexible,
robust, and highly accurate model for pupil and corneal reflection
identification in rodent gaze determination that can be incrementally trained
to account for variability in eye parameters encountered in the field. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that demonstrates a highly
accurate and practical biomedical image segmentation based convolutional neural
network architecture for pupil and corneal reflection identification in eye
images. This new method, in conjunction with our automated infrared videobased
eye recording system, offers the state of the art technology in eye tracking
for neuroscience and vision science research for rodents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像的高质量体积网格生成是个性化医疗中物理模拟的关键瓶颈，现有深度学习方法在高曲率区域和部件间距上存在不足。

Method: 采用“snap-and-tune”策略，结合深度学习快速初始形状拟合和测试时优化进行样本特异性网格修正。

Conclusion: 该方法在两种软件平台上验证了其多功能性和实用性，代码已开源。

Abstract: High-quality volumetric meshing from medical images is a key bottleneck for
physics-based simulations in personalized medicine. For volumetric meshing of
complex medical structures, recent studies have often utilized deep learning
(DL)-based template deformation approaches to enable fast test-time generation
with high spatial accuracy. However, these approaches still exhibit
limitations, such as limited flexibility at high-curvature areas and
unrealistic inter-part distances. In this study, we introduce a simple yet
effective snap-and-tune strategy that sequentially applies DL and test-time
optimization, which combines fast initial shape fitting with more detailed
sample-specific mesh corrections. Our method provides significant improvements
in both spatial accuracy and mesh quality, while being fully automated and
requiring no additional training labels. Finally, we demonstrate the
versatility and usefulness of our newly generated meshes via solid mechanics
simulations in two different software platforms. Our code is available at

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习的模型DCD，用于自动分割胎儿A4C视图中的关键解剖结构，以提高分割精度并减少超声医师的工作量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胎儿A4C视图的精确分割对先天性心脏病的早期诊断至关重要，但由于超声伪影、噪声和解剖变异性等问题，传统方法难以实现高精度分割。

Method: DCD模型结合了Dense ASPP模块和CBAM模块，通过多尺度特征提取和自适应特征表示提升分割性能。

Result: DCD模型能够精确且鲁棒地分割解剖结构，有助于改善产前心脏评估。

Conclusion: DCD模型为胎儿A4C视图的自动分割提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案，有望在临床中广泛应用。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of anatomical structures in the apical four-chamber
(A4C) view of fetal echocardiography is essential for early diagnosis and
prenatal evaluation of congenital heart disease (CHD). However, precise
segmentation remains challenging due to ultrasound artifacts, speckle noise,
anatomical variability, and boundary ambiguity across different gestational
stages. To reduce the workload of sonographers and enhance segmentation
accuracy, we propose DCD, an advanced deep learning-based model for automatic
segmentation of key anatomical structures in the fetal A4C view. Our model
incorporates a Dense Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (Dense ASPP) module,
enabling superior multi-scale feature extraction, and a Convolutional Block
Attention Module (CBAM) to enhance adaptive feature representation. By
effectively capturing both local and global contextual information, DCD
achieves precise and robust segmentation, contributing to improved prenatal
cardiac assessment.

*Srinivasan Kidambi,Pravin Nair*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: PnP-Nystra是一种基于Nyström的线性自注意力近似方法，作为即插即用模块，可在不重新训练的情况下加速预训练的图像和视频修复模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多头自注意力（MHSA）在计算机视觉模型中广泛应用，但其二次复杂度在实时和资源受限环境中成为计算瓶颈。

Method: 提出PnP-Nystra，作为MHSA的线性近似替代，适用于多种基于窗口的Transformer架构（如SwinIR、Uformer、RVRT）。

Result: 在图像和视频修复任务中，PnP-Nystra在GPU和CPU上分别实现2-4倍和2-5倍加速，PSNR最大仅下降1.5 dB。

Conclusion: PnP-Nystra是首个无需训练的线性注意力替代方案，显著提升效率且性能损失极小。

Abstract: Multi-head self-attention (MHSA) has become a core component in modern
computer vision models. However, its quadratic complexity with respect to input
length poses a significant computational bottleneck in real-time and resource
constrained environments. We propose PnP-Nystra, a Nystr\"om based linear
approximation of self-attention, developed as a plug-and-play (PnP) module that
can be integrated into the pre-trained image and video restoration models
without retraining. As a drop-in replacement for MHSA, PnP-Nystra enables
efficient acceleration in various window-based transformer architectures,
including SwinIR, Uformer, and RVRT. Our experiments across diverse image and
video restoration tasks, including denoising, deblurring, and super-resolution,
demonstrate that PnP-Nystra achieves a 2-4x speed-up on an NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU
and a 2-5x speed-up on CPU inference. Despite these significant gains, the
method incurs a maximum PSNR drop of only 1.5 dB across all evaluated tasks. To
the best of our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate a linear attention
functioning as a training-free substitute for MHSA in restoration models.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种生物启发的深度学习集成框架，用于同时分类16种胎儿结构，在复杂临床数据中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决胎儿超声图像分类中因图像质量低、类内差异大和类别不平衡带来的挑战。

Method: 采用双分支架构（浅层路径和细节路径），结合EfficientNet-B0和EfficientNet-B6模型，使用LDAM-Focal损失函数。

Result: 在5298张临床图像上，90%的器官分类准确率>0.75，75%的器官>0.85，性能优于其他复杂模型。

Conclusion: 生物启发的模块化堆叠方法在复杂临床环境中具有鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Accurate classification of second-trimester fetal ultrasound images remains
challenging due to low image quality, high intra-class variability, and
significant class imbalance. In this work, we introduce a simple yet powerful,
biologically inspired deep learning ensemble framework that-unlike prior
studies focused on only a handful of anatomical targets-simultaneously
distinguishes 16 fetal structures. Drawing on the hierarchical, modular
organization of biological vision systems, our model stacks two complementary
branches (a "shallow" path for coarse, low-resolution cues and a "detailed"
path for fine, high-resolution features), concatenating their outputs for final
prediction. To our knowledge, no existing method has addressed such a large
number of classes with a comparably lightweight architecture. We trained and
evaluated on 5,298 routinely acquired clinical images (annotated by three
experts and reconciled via Dawid-Skene), reflecting real-world noise and
variability rather than a "cleaned" dataset. Despite this complexity, our
ensemble (EfficientNet-B0 + EfficientNet-B6 with LDAM-Focal loss) identifies
90% of organs with accuracy > 0.75 and 75% of organs with accuracy >
0.85-performance competitive with more elaborate models applied to far fewer
categories. These results demonstrate that biologically inspired modular
stacking can yield robust, scalable fetal anatomy recognition in challenging
clinical settings.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MAMBO的基于补丁的扩散模型，用于生成高分辨率乳腺X光片，解决了训练AI系统时数据不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于隐私和伦理限制，获取大规模多样化的乳腺X光数据集困难，影响了AI系统的训练效果。

Method: MAMBO通过整合局部和全局扩散模型，生成高达3840x3840像素的高分辨率乳腺X光片。

Result: 实验证明MAMBO能生成高度真实的图像，并可用于分类模型训练和异常检测。

Conclusion: MAMBO在乳腺X光分析中具有潜力，可提高诊断准确性和早期病变检测。

Abstract: Mammography is the gold standard for the detection and diagnosis of breast
cancer. This procedure can be significantly enhanced with Artificial
Intelligence (AI)-based software, which assists radiologists in identifying
abnormalities. However, training AI systems requires large and diverse
datasets, which are often difficult to obtain due to privacy and ethical
constraints. To address this issue, the paper introduces MAMmography ensemBle
mOdel (MAMBO), a novel patch-based diffusion approach designed to generate
full-resolution mammograms. Diffusion models have shown breakthrough results in
realistic image generation, yet few studies have focused on mammograms, and
none have successfully generated high-resolution outputs required to capture
fine-grained features of small lesions. To achieve this, MAMBO integrates
separate diffusion models to capture both local and global (image-level)
contexts. The contextual information is then fed into the final patch-based
model, significantly aiding the noise removal process. This thoughtful design
enables MAMBO to generate highly realistic mammograms of up to 3840x3840
pixels. Importantly, this approach can be used to enhance the training of
classification models and extended to anomaly detection. Experiments, both
numerical and radiologist validation, assess MAMBO's capabilities in image
generation, super-resolution, and anomaly detection, highlighting its potential
to enhance mammography analysis for more accurate diagnoses and earlier lesion
detection.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 通过多模态学习提升CBCT到CT的合成质量，显著改善低质量CBCT-CT对齐情况下的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CBCT虽然广泛用于实时术中成像，但存在显著伪影和视觉质量低的问题，需通过合成CT（sCT）改善。

Method: 采用多模态学习方法，结合术中CBCT和术前CT数据，生成高质量sCT。

Result: 多模态sCT在低质量CBCT-CT对齐情况下表现最佳，结果在真实临床数据中高度可重复。

Conclusion: 多模态学习能有效提升sCT生成质量，尤其在CBCT质量较差时效果显著。

Abstract: Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) is widely used for real-time
intraoperative imaging due to its low radiation dose and high acquisition
speed. However, despite its high resolution, CBCT suffers from significant
artifacts and thereby lower visual quality, compared to conventional Computed
Tomography (CT). A recent approach to mitigate these artifacts is synthetic CT
(sCT) generation, translating CBCT volumes into the CT domain. In this work, we
enhance sCT generation through multimodal learning, integrating intraoperative
CBCT with preoperative CT. Beyond validation on two real-world datasets, we use
a versatile synthetic dataset, to analyze how CBCT-CT alignment and CBCT
quality affect sCT quality. The results demonstrate that multimodal sCT
consistently outperform unimodal baselines, with the most significant gains
observed in well-aligned, low-quality CBCT-CT cases. Finally, we demonstrate
that these findings are highly reproducible in real-world clinical datasets.

self-evolving aerial ecosystems, system-level collaboration, and sustainable,
equitable deployments. This survey establishes a foundational framework for the
future development, deployment, and governance of agentic aerial systems
(Agentic UAVs) across diverse societal and industrial domains.

Conclusion: CALL通过轻量级信息共享和世界模型的泛化能力，有效提升了MARL在复杂环境中的性能。

Abstract: We study multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for tasks in complex
high-dimensional environments, such as autonomous driving. MARL is known to
suffer from the \textit{partial observability} and \textit{non-stationarity}
issues. To tackle these challenges, information sharing is often employed,
which however faces major hurdles in practice, including overwhelming
communication overhead and scalability concerns. By making use of generative AI
embodied in world model together with its latent representation, we develop
{\it CALL}, \underline{C}ommunic\underline{a}tive Wor\underline{l}d
Mode\underline{l}, for MARL, where 1) each agent first learns its world model
that encodes its state and intention into low-dimensional latent representation
with smaller memory footprint, which can be shared with other agents of
interest via lightweight communication; and 2) each agent carries out
ego-centric learning while exploiting lightweight information sharing to enrich
her world model, and then exploits its generalization capacity to improve
prediction for better planning. We characterize the gain on the prediction
accuracy from the information sharing and its impact on performance gap.
Extensive experiments are carried out on the challenging local trajectory
planning tasks in the CARLA platform to demonstrate the performance gains of
using \textit{CALL}.

Result: 实验表明，Re4MPC比传统NMPC方法计算效率更高，且末端执行器目标达成率更高。

Conclusion: Re4MPC为高自由度机器人提供了一种高效且成功的运动规划解决方案。

Abstract: Traditional motion planning methods for robots with many degrees-of-freedom,
such as mobile manipulators, are often computationally prohibitive for
real-world settings. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-model motion
planning pipeline, termed Re4MPC, which computes trajectories using Nonlinear
Model Predictive Control (NMPC). Re4MPC generates trajectories in a
computationally efficient manner by reactively selecting the model, cost, and
constraints of the NMPC problem depending on the complexity of the task and
robot state. The policy for this reactive decision-making is learned via a Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework. We introduce a mathematical formulation
to integrate NMPC into this DRL framework. To validate our methodology and
design choices, we evaluate DRL training and test outcomes in a physics-based
simulation involving a mobile manipulator. Experimental results demonstrate
that Re4MPC is more computationally efficient and achieves higher success rates
in reaching end-effector goals than the NMPC baseline, which computes
whole-body trajectories without our learning mechanism.

Abstract: Safety validation of autonomous driving systems is extremely challenging due
to the high risks and costs of real-world testing as well as the rarity and
diversity of potential failures. To address these challenges, we train a
denoising diffusion model to generate potential failure cases of an autonomous

problem show that in a variety of scenarios, the diffusion model can generate
realistic failure samples while capturing a wide variety of potential failures.
Our model does not require any external training dataset, can perform training

Conclusion: PhyBlock可作为统一测试平台，推动视觉语言理解与真实世界物理问题解决的结合。

Abstract: While vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated promising capabilities
in reasoning and planning for embodied agents, their ability to comprehend
physical phenomena, particularly within structured 3D environments, remains
severely limited. To close this gap, we introduce PhyBlock, a progressive
benchmark designed to assess VLMs on physical understanding and planning
through robotic 3D block assembly tasks. PhyBlock integrates a novel four-level
cognitive hierarchy assembly task alongside targeted Visual Question Answering
(VQA) samples, collectively aimed at evaluating progressive spatial reasoning
and fundamental physical comprehension, including object properties, spatial
relationships, and holistic scene understanding. PhyBlock includes 2600 block
tasks (400 assembly tasks, 2200 VQA tasks) and evaluates models across three
key dimensions: partial completion, failure diagnosis, and planning robustness.
We benchmark 21 state-of-the-art VLMs, highlighting their strengths and
limitations in physically grounded, multi-step planning. Our empirical findings
indicate that the performance of VLMs exhibits pronounced limitations in
high-level planning and reasoning capabilities, leading to a notable decline in
performance for the growing complexity of the tasks. Error analysis reveals
persistent difficulties in spatial orientation and dependency reasoning.
Surprisingly, chain-of-thought prompting offers minimal improvements,
suggesting spatial tasks heavily rely on intuitive model comprehension. We
position PhyBlock as a unified testbed to advance embodied reasoning, bridging
vision-language understanding and real-world physical problem-solving.

Abstract: Real-world robotic applications, from autonomous exploration to assistive
technologies, require adaptive, interpretable, and data-efficient learning
paradigms. While deep learning architectures and foundation models have driven
significant advances in diverse robotic applications, they remain limited in
their ability to operate efficiently and reliably in unknown and dynamic
environments. In this position paper, we critically assess these limitations
and introduce a conceptual framework for combining data-driven learning with
deliberate, structured reasoning. Specifically, we propose leveraging
differentiable physics for efficient world modeling, Bayesian inference for
uncertainty-aware decision-making, and meta-learning for rapid adaptation to
new tasks. By embedding physical symbolic reasoning within neural models,
robots could generalize beyond their training data, reason about novel
situations, and continuously expand their knowledge. We argue that such hybrid
neuro-symbolic architectures are essential for the next generation of
autonomous systems, and to this end, we provide a research roadmap to guide and
accelerate their development.

Abstract: Limb loss affects millions globally, impairing physical function and reducing
quality of life. Most traditional surface electromyographic (sEMG) and
semi-autonomous methods require users to generate myoelectric signals for each
control, imposing physically and mentally taxing demands. This study aims to
develop a fully autonomous control system that enables a prosthetic hand to
automatically grasp and release objects of various shapes using only a camera
attached to the wrist. By placing the hand near an object, the system will
automatically execute grasping actions with a proper grip force in response to
the hand's movements and the environment. To release the object being grasped,
just naturally place the object close to the table and the system will
automatically open the hand. Such a system would provide individuals with limb
loss with a very easy-to-use prosthetic control interface and greatly reduce
mental effort while using. To achieve this goal, we developed a teleoperation
system to collect human demonstration data for training the prosthetic hand
control model using imitation learning, which mimics the prosthetic hand
actions from human. Through training the model using only a few objects' data
from one single participant, we have shown that the imitation learning
algorithm can achieve high success rates, generalizing to more individuals and
unseen objects with a variation of weights. The demonstrations are available at

Abstract: Generative modeling-based visuomotor policies have been widely adopted in
robotic manipulation attributed to their ability to model multimodal action

their applicability in real-time robotic systems. To address this issue,
existing approaches accelerate the sampling process in generative
modeling-based visuomotor policies by adapting acceleration techniques
originally developed for image generation. Despite this progress, a major
distinction remains: image generation typically involves producing independent
samples without temporal dependencies, whereas robotic manipulation involves
generating time-series action trajectories that require continuity and temporal
coherence. To effectively exploit temporal information in robotic manipulation,
we propose FreqPolicy, a novel approach that first imposes frequency
consistency constraints on flow-based visuomotor policies. Our work enables the
action model to capture temporal structure effectively while supporting
efficient, high-quality one-step action generation. We introduce a frequency
consistency constraint that enforces alignment of frequency-domain action
features across different timesteps along the flow, thereby promoting
convergence of one-step action generation toward the target distribution. In
addition, we design an adaptive consistency loss to capture structural temporal
variations inherent in robotic manipulation tasks. We assess FreqPolicy on 53
tasks across 3 simulation benchmarks, proving its superiority over existing
one-step action generators. We further integrate FreqPolicy into the
vision-language-action (VLA) model and achieve acceleration without performance
degradation on the 40 tasks of Libero. Besides, we show efficiency and
effectiveness in real-world robotic scenarios with an inference frequency
93.5Hz. The code will be publicly available.

### [236] [Exp4Fuse: A Rank Fusion Framework for Enhanced Sparse Retrieval using Large Language Model-based Query Expansion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04760)
*Lingyuan Liu,Mengxiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Exp4Fuse是一种新型融合排名框架，通过零样本LLM查询扩展提升稀疏检索性能，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM查询扩展方法依赖高质量生成文档，成本高且计算量大，需改进稀疏检索性能。

Method: 提出Exp4Fuse框架，结合原始查询和LLM增强查询的检索路径，通过改进的互惠排名融合方法生成排名列表。

Result: 在多个数据集上，Exp4Fuse优于现有LLM查询扩展方法，结合高级稀疏检索器时达到SOTA结果。

Conclusion: Exp4Fuse在提升稀疏检索性能方面表现出色，验证了其高效性和优越性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential in generating hypothetical
documents for query expansion, thereby enhancing information retrieval
performance. However, the efficacy of this method is highly dependent on the
quality of the generated documents, which often requires complex prompt
strategies and the integration of advanced dense retrieval techniques. This can
be both costly and computationally intensive. To mitigate these limitations, we
explore the use of zero-shot LLM-based query expansion to improve sparse
retrieval, particularly for learned sparse retrievers. We introduce a novel
fusion ranking framework, Exp4Fuse, which enhances the performance of sparse
retrievers through an indirect application of zero-shot LLM-based query
expansion. Exp4Fuse operates by simultaneously considering two retrieval
routes-one based on the original query and the other on the LLM-augmented
query. It then generates two ranked lists using a sparse retriever and fuses
them using a modified reciprocal rank fusion method. We conduct extensive
evaluations of Exp4Fuse against leading LLM-based query expansion methods and
advanced retrieval techniques on three MS MARCO-related datasets and seven
low-resource datasets. Experimental results reveal that Exp4Fuse not only
surpasses existing LLM-based query expansion methods in enhancing sparse
retrievers but also, when combined with advanced sparse retrievers, achieves
SOTA results on several benchmarks. This highlights the superior performance
and effectiveness of Exp4Fuse in improving query expansion for sparse
retrieval.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为分层词汇图（HLG）的三层索引方法，以解决检索增强生成（RAG）在跨语义远距离文档拼接答案时的不足。HLG通过追踪原子命题、聚类潜在主题和链接实体关系，构建了两个互补的检索器。实验表明，该方法在五个数据集上平均提升了23.1%的检索召回率和正确性。

Motivation: 现有RAG方法在需要跨语义远距离文档拼接答案时表现不佳，缺乏有效的多跳检索能力。

Method: 提出HLG三层索引方法，包括原子命题追踪、潜在主题聚类和实体关系链接，并构建了StatementGraphRAG和TopicGraphRAG两个互补的检索器。

Result: 在五个数据集上的实验显示，该方法平均提升了23.1%的检索召回率和正确性。

Conclusion: HLG和配套检索器显著提升了RAG在多跳检索任务中的性能，并通过开源工具包促进了实际应用。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) grounds large language models in
external evidence, yet it still falters when answers must be pieced together
across semantically distant documents. We close this gap with the Hierarchical
Lexical Graph (HLG), a three-tier index that (i) traces every atomic
proposition to its source, (ii) clusters propositions into latent topics, and
(iii) links entities and relations to expose cross-document paths. On top of
HLG we build two complementary, plug-and-play retrievers: StatementGraphRAG,
which performs fine-grained entity-aware beam search over propositions for
high-precision factoid questions, and TopicGraphRAG, which selects coarse
topics before expanding along entity links to supply broad yet relevant context
for exploratory queries. Additionally, existing benchmarks lack the complexity
required to rigorously evaluate multi-hop summarization systems, often focusing
on single-document queries or limited datasets. To address this, we introduce a
synthetic dataset generation pipeline that curates realistic, multi-document
question-answer pairs, enabling robust evaluation of multi-hop retrieval
systems. Extensive experiments across five datasets demonstrate that our
methods outperform naive chunk-based RAG achieving an average relative
improvement of 23.1% in retrieval recall and correctness. Open-source Python
library is available at https://github.com/awslabs/graphrag-toolkit.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种将RDF知识图谱与GNN结合的方法，充分利用其语义信息，显著提升了推荐系统的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管已有大量RDF知识图谱，但其丰富的语义信息在基于GNN的推荐系统中尚未被充分利用。

Method: 提出了一种综合集成方法，利用RDF对象属性的拓扑信息和数据类型属性的内容信息，并深入评估了不同GNN的性能。

Result: 实验表明，利用RDF知识图谱的语义丰富性显著提高了推荐系统的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为基于GNN的推荐系统在Linked Open Data云中的应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have substantially advanced the field of
recommender systems. However, despite the creation of more than a thousand
knowledge graphs (KGs) under the W3C standard RDF, their rich semantic
information has not yet been fully leveraged in GNN-based recommender systems.
To address this gap, we propose a comprehensive integration of RDF KGs with
GNNs that utilizes both the topological information from RDF object properties
and the content information from RDF datatype properties. Our main focus is an
in-depth evaluation of various GNNs, analyzing how different semantic feature
initializations and types of graph structure heterogeneity influence their
performance in recommendation tasks. Through experiments across multiple
recommendation scenarios involving multi-million-node RDF graphs, we
demonstrate that harnessing the semantic richness of RDF KGs significantly
improves recommender systems and lays the groundwork for GNN-based recommender
systems for the Linked Open Data cloud. The code and data are available on our
GitHub repository: https://github.com/davidlamprecht/rdf-gnn-recommendation

TL;DR: 该论文研究了多模态检索中的特征对齐问题，探讨了视觉和文本嵌入的几何关系，并比较了多种相似性度量方法。结果表明，Wasserstein距离能有效衡量模态差距，而余弦相似性在特征对齐任务中表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态检索中，不同机器学习模型对同一概念的表示方式不同，这为跨模态特征对齐带来了挑战。研究旨在探索视觉和文本嵌入的关系，并找到最佳的对齐方法。

Method: 研究首先分析了视觉和文本嵌入的几何关系，然后使用四种标准相似性度量和两种基于神经网络的学习度量进行对齐。

Result: Wasserstein距离可作为模态差距的有效度量，余弦相似性在特征对齐任务中表现最优，且传统多层感知机难以捕捉图像和文本间的复杂交互。

Conclusion: 研究为多模态信息检索提供了新见解，特别是在实际跨模态应用中，强调了余弦相似性的优越性和传统架构的局限性。

Abstract: Different machine learning models can represent the same underlying concept
in different ways. This variability is particularly valuable for in-the-wild
multimodal retrieval, where the objective is to identify the corresponding
representation in one modality given another modality as input. This challenge
can be effectively framed as a feature alignment problem. For example, given a
sentence encoded by a language model, retrieve the most semantically aligned
image based on features produced by an image encoder, or vice versa. In this
work, we first investigate the geometric relationships between visual and
textual embeddings derived from both vision-language models and combined
unimodal models. We then align these representations using four standard
similarity metrics as well as two learned ones, implemented via neural
networks. Our findings indicate that the Wasserstein distance can serve as an
informative measure of the modality gap, while cosine similarity consistently
outperforms alternative metrics in feature alignment tasks. Furthermore, we
observe that conventional architectures such as multilayer perceptrons are
insufficient for capturing the complex interactions between image and text
representations. Our study offers novel insights and practical considerations
for researchers working in multimodal information retrieval, particularly in
real-world, cross-modal applications.

Result: 实验证明Flow-Lenia能生成复杂生物样模式，并展示出进化动态。

Conclusion: Flow-Lenia为研究生命样模式和进化动态提供了新工具。

Abstract: Central to the artificial life endeavour is the creation of artificial
systems spontaneously generating properties found in the living world such as
autopoiesis, self-replication, evolution and open-endedness. While numerous
models and paradigms have been proposed, cellular automata (CA) have taken a
very important place in the field notably as they enable the study of
phenomenons like self-reproduction and autopoiesis. Continuous CA like Lenia
have been showed to produce life-like patterns reminiscent, on an aesthetic and
ontological point of view, of biological organisms we call creatures. We
propose in this paper Flow-Lenia, a mass conservative extension of Lenia. We
present experiments demonstrating its effectiveness in generating
spatially-localized patters (SLPs) with complex behaviors and show that the
update rule parameters can be optimized to generate complex creatures showing
behaviors of interest. Furthermore, we show that Flow-Lenia allows us to embed
the parameters of the model, defining the properties of the emerging patterns,
within its own dynamics thus allowing for multispecies simulations. By using
the evolutionary activity framework as well as other metrics, we shed light on
the emergent evolutionary dynamics taking place in this system.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KVmix是一种针对大型语言模型（LLM）中键值（KV）缓存的新型混合精度量化方法，通过动态分配精度和优化长上下文任务，显著降低内存需求并提升推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV缓存的高内存需求限制了LLM在资源受限平台上的部署，现有量化方法无法动态分配精度或优化长上下文任务，导致内存、准确性和吞吐量之间的权衡。

Method: KVmix利用基于梯度的重要性分析，为KV投影矩阵分配层特定的比特宽度，动态优先处理重要层，同时引入长上下文优化策略，高效压缩旧KV对。

Result: 在Llama和Mistral等LLM上，KVmix以极低量化配置（Key 2.19bit，Value 2.38bit）实现接近无损的推理性能，内存压缩4.9倍，推理吞吐量提升5.3倍。

Conclusion: KVmix通过动态混合精度量化和长上下文优化，显著提升了LLM在资源受限环境中的部署能力，平衡了内存、准确性和效率。

Abstract: The high memory demands of the Key-Value (KV) Cache during the inference of
Large Language Models (LLMs) severely restrict their deployment in
resource-constrained platforms. Quantization can effectively alleviate the
memory pressure caused by KV Cache. However, existing methods either rely on
static one-size-fits-all precision allocation or fail to dynamically prioritize
critical KV in long-context tasks, forcing memory-accuracy-throughput
tradeoffs. In this work, we propose a novel mixed-precision quantization method
for KV Cache named KVmix. KVmix leverages gradient-based importance analysis to
evaluate how individual Key and Value projection matrices affect the model
loss, enabling layer-specific bit-width allocation for mix-precision
quantization. It dynamically prioritizes higher precision for important layers
while aggressively quantizing less influential ones, achieving a tunable
balance between accuracy and efficiency. KVmix also introduces a dynamic
long-context optimization strategy that adaptively keeps full-precision KV
pairs for recent pivotal tokens and compresses older ones, achieving
high-quality sequence generation with low memory usage. Additionally, KVmix
provides efficient low-bit quantization and CUDA kernels to optimize
computational overhead. On LLMs such as Llama and Mistral, KVmix achieves
near-lossless inference performance with extremely low quantization
configuration (Key 2.19bit Value 2.38bit), while delivering a remarkable 4.9x
memory compression and a 5.3x speedup in inference throughput.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 部分域自适应问题需要对齐跨域样本并区分异常类，但现有加权框架仅能表征样本级关系，对异常类的识别不够准确。

Method: 提出BUOT模型，结合样本级和类级传输，通过合作机制提供结构信息和判别信息，并引入标签感知传输成本以提升效率。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验验证了BUOT的竞争力。

Conclusion: BUOT模型通过双层次传输框架有效解决了部分域自适应问题，提升了知识转移的准确性。

Abstract: Partial domain adaptation (PDA) problem requires aligning cross-domain
samples while distinguishing the outlier classes for accurate knowledge
transfer. The widely used weighting framework tries to address the outlier
classes by introducing the reweighed source domain with a similar label
distribution to the target domain. However, the empirical modeling of weights
can only characterize the sample-wise relations, which leads to insufficient
exploration of cluster structures, and the weights could be sensitive to the
inaccurate prediction and cause confusion on the outlier classes. To tackle
these issues, we propose a Bi-level Unbalanced Optimal Transport (BUOT) model
to simultaneously characterize the sample-wise and class-wise relations in a
unified transport framework. Specifically, a cooperation mechanism between
sample-level and class-level transport is introduced, where the sample-level
transport provides essential structure information for the class-level
knowledge transfer, while the class-level transport supplies discriminative
information for the outlier identification. The bi-level transport plan
provides guidance for the alignment process. By incorporating the label-aware
transport cost, the local transport structure is ensured and a fast computation
formulation is derived to improve the efficiency. Extensive experiments on
benchmark datasets validate the competitiveness of BUOT.

Motivation: 现有偏好优化方法未能有效抑制LLM内部偏见，且依赖离线数据，无法适应动态分布变化。MBPO旨在解决这些问题。

Method: MBPO通过对抗性扰动生成硬负样本，构建离线偏好数据集，并利用闭端任务生成在线验证奖励，结合GRPO进行训练。

Result: 实验表明MBPO能显著提升LMMs在视觉语言任务中的性能，并减少幻觉现象。

Conclusion: MBPO通过平衡模态和混合数据训练，为LMMs的偏好优化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The task adaptation and alignment of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have been
significantly advanced by instruction tuning and further strengthened by recent
preference optimization. Yet, most LMMs still suffer from severe modality
imbalance during reasoning, i.e., outweighing language prior biases over visual
inputs, which bottlenecks their generalization to downstream tasks and causes
hallucinations. However, existing preference optimization approaches for LMMs
do not focus on restraining the internal biases of their Large Language Model
(LLM) backbones when curating the training data. Moreover, they heavily rely on
offline data and lack the capacity to explore diverse responses adaptive to
dynamic distributional shifts during training. Meanwhile, Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), a recent method using online-generated data and verified
rewards to improve reasoning capabilities, remains largely underexplored in LMM
alignment. In this paper, we propose a novel preference learning framework,
Modality-Balancing Preference Optimization (MBPO), to address the modality
imbalance in LMMs. MBPO constructs a more effective offline preference dataset
by generating hard negatives, i.e., rejected responses misled by LLM biases due
to limited usage of visual information, through adversarial perturbation of
input images. Moreover, MBPO leverages the easy-to-verify nature of close-ended
tasks to generate online responses with verified rewards. GRPO is then employed
to train the model with offline-online hybrid data. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MBPO can enhance LMM performance on challenging
vision-language tasks and effectively reduce hallucinations.

Result: 实验表明，改进的舍入模式成功支持了8B模型在15T tokens上的MXFP8预训练。

Conclusion: 改进的舍入模式是MX格式成功应用于大规模LLM预训练的关键。

Abstract: Precision scaling - using fewer bits to represent model parameters and
related tensors during pre-training - has emerged as a compelling technique for
improving GPU efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. Microscaling (MX)
formats in NVIDIA's latest Blackwell GPUs represent a major leap in enabling
this precision scaling aspect. These formats combine narrow floating-point data
types with per-block scaling factors, offering a fine-grained approach to
quantizing tensors.
  Although MX-formats offer the promise of improved numeric stability compared
to other reduced-precision representations, in practice they must be used
carefully in order to successfully converge an LLM on a multi-trillion token
dataset. In this paper, we show that the rounding mode suggested in OCP
specification can lead to divergence when pre-training an LLM. We show an
improved rounding mode, which uses round-to-infinity to compute scaling
factors, enables successful pre-training in MXFP8 for an 8B model on 15T
tokens.

Conclusion: STAMImputer通过动态图结构和MoE框架有效解决了交通数据填补中的关键问题。

Abstract: Traffic data imputation is fundamentally important to support various
applications in intelligent transportation systems such as traffic flow
prediction. However, existing time-to-space sequential methods often fail to
effectively extract features in block-wise missing data scenarios. Meanwhile,
the static graph structure for spatial feature propagation significantly
constrains the models flexibility in handling the distribution shift issue for
the nonstationary traffic data. To address these issues, this paper proposes a
SpatioTemporal Attention Mixture of experts network named STAMImputer for
traffic data imputation. Specifically, we introduce a Mixture of Experts (MoE)
framework to capture latent spatio-temporal features and their influence
weights, effectively imputing block missing. A novel Low-rank guided Sampling
Graph ATtention (LrSGAT) mechanism is designed to dynamically balance the local
and global correlations across road networks. The sampled attention vectors are
utilized to generate dynamic graphs that capture real-time spatial
correlations. Extensive experiments are conducted on four traffic datasets for
evaluation. The result shows STAMImputer achieves significantly performance
improvement compared with existing SOTA approaches. Our codes are available at

Conclusion: 研究为高效部署大型语言模型提供了理论基础，实际技术（如检索增强生成）可将理论应用于现实场景。

Abstract: Large language models have transformed natural language processing, yet
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) remains computationally intensive. This paper
formally proves that capabilities acquired through SFT can be approximated by a
base transformer model using inference-time techniques, specifically in-context
learning (ICL), without altering model parameters, under idealized assumptions
including unbounded computational resources and access to the fine-tuning
dataset. We extend these results to practical scenarios with finite context
lengths and partial dataset access. For text generation tasks with fixed output
length $l$, datasets of size $\mathrm{O}\left( \frac{m V}{\varepsilon^2} \log
\frac{m}{\delta} \right)$ or, with bounded context, $\mathrm{O}\left( \frac{l
\log V}{\varepsilon^2} \log \frac{1}{\delta} \right)$ suffice to approximate
fine-tuned behavior across $m$ contexts within error $\varepsilon$, where $V$
is the vocabulary size and $\delta$ is the failure probability. For linear
classification, datasets of size $\mathrm{O}\left( \frac{d}{\varepsilon}
\right)$ or, with fixed context, $\mathrm{O}\left( \frac{1}{\varepsilon^2} \log
\frac{1}{\delta} \right)$ are sufficient, where $d$ is the input dimension.
Grounded in the Turing completeness of transformers, these results provide a
theoretical foundation for resource-efficient deployment of large language
models, with practical techniques like retrieval-augmented generation bridging
theory to real-world applications.

Result: 在多个离线基准测试中，FairDICE表现出优于现有基线的公平感知性能。

Conclusion: FairDICE为离线多目标强化学习中的非线性福利优化提供了统一且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) aims to optimize policies in
the presence of conflicting objectives, where linear scalarization is commonly
used to reduce vector-valued returns into scalar signals. While effective for
certain preferences, this approach cannot capture fairness-oriented goals such
as Nash social welfare or max-min fairness, which require nonlinear and
non-additive trade-offs. Although several online algorithms have been proposed
for specific fairness objectives, a unified approach for optimizing nonlinear
welfare criteria in the offline setting-where learning must proceed from a
fixed dataset-remains unexplored. In this work, we present FairDICE, the first
offline MORL framework that directly optimizes nonlinear welfare objective.
FairDICE leverages distribution correction estimation to jointly account for
welfare maximization and distributional regularization, enabling stable and
sample-efficient learning without requiring explicit preference weights or
exhaustive weight search. Across multiple offline benchmarks, FairDICE
demonstrates strong fairness-aware performance compared to existing baselines.

Abstract: Machine learning relies heavily on data, yet the continuous growth of
real-world data poses challenges for efficient dataset construction and
training. A fundamental yet unsolved question is: given our current model and
data, does a new data (sample/batch) need annotation/learning? Conventional
approaches retain all available data, leading to non-optimal data and training
efficiency. Active learning aims to reduce data redundancy by selecting a
subset of samples to annotate, while it increases pipeline complexity and
introduces bias. In this work, we propose Info-Coevolution, a novel framework
that efficiently enables models and data to coevolve through online selective
annotation with no bias. Leveraging task-specific models (and open-source
models), it selectively annotates and integrates online and web data to improve
datasets efficiently. For real-world datasets like ImageNet-1K,
Info-Coevolution reduces annotation and training costs by 32\% without
performance loss. It is able to automatically give the saving ratio without
tuning the ratio. It can further reduce the annotation ratio to 50\% with
semi-supervised learning. We also explore retrieval-based dataset enhancement
using unlabeled open-source data. Code is available at

models (TSFMs) for time series forecasting, their effectiveness in EPF remains
uncertain. To address this gap, we benchmark several state-of-the-art
pretrained models--Chronos-Bolt, Chronos-T5, TimesFM, Moirai, Time-MoE, and
TimeGPT--against established statistical and machine learning (ML) methods for
EPF. Using 2024 day-ahead auction (DAA) electricity prices from Germany,
France, the Netherlands, Austria, and Belgium, we generate daily forecasts with
a one-day horizon. Chronos-Bolt and Time-MoE emerge as the strongest among the
TSFMs, performing on par with traditional models. However, the biseasonal MSTL
model, which captures daily and weekly seasonality, stands out for its
consistent performance across countries and evaluation metrics, with no TSFM
statistically outperforming it.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为NONA的可微分k-NN回归层，用于结合传统算法和神经网络的优点，提升监督学习性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统算法（如k-NN）与神经网络结合时表现优异，但因其不可微分性难以直接集成到监督微调中。

Method: 提出NONA层，利用注意力机制和学习的注意力掩码，作为k-NN回归的可微分替代。

Result: 在多个非结构化数据集上，NONA在回归任务中优于密集层预测和k-NN。

Conclusion: NONA为将传统算法集成到神经网络提供了一种可行方案，并展示了性能提升。

Abstract: It is common in supervised machine learning to combine the feature extraction
capabilities of neural networks with the predictive power of traditional
algorithms, such as k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) or support vector machines. This
procedure involves performing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on a
domain-appropriate feature extractor, followed by training a traditional
predictor on the resulting SFT embeddings. When used in this manner,
traditional predictors often deliver increased performance over the SFT model
itself, despite the fine-tuned feature extractor yielding embeddings
specifically optimized for prediction by the neural network's final dense
layer. This suggests that directly incorporating traditional algorithms into
SFT as prediction layers may further improve performance. However, many
traditional algorithms have not been implemented as neural network layers due
to their non-differentiable nature and their unique optimization requirements.
As a step towards solving this problem, we introduce the Nearness of Neighbors
Attention (NONA) regression layer. NONA uses the mechanics of neural network
attention and a novel learned attention-masking scheme to yield a
differentiable proxy of the k-NN regression algorithm. Results on multiple
unstructured datasets show improved performance over both dense layer
prediction and k-NN on SFT embeddings for regression.

TL;DR: UniVarFL是一种新的联邦学习框架，通过两种正则化策略解决非IID数据导致的性能下降问题，无需依赖全局模型。


<details>

Motivation: 非IID数据导致联邦学习性能下降，传统方法计算成本高或适应性差。

Method: UniVarFL采用分类器方差正则化和超球面均匀正则化，模拟IID训练动态。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，UniVarFL在准确性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: UniVarFL是一种高效、可扩展的解决方案，适用于资源受限的实际部署。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) often suffers from severe performance degradation
when faced with non-IID data, largely due to local classifier bias. Traditional
remedies such as global model regularization or layer freezing either incur
high computational costs or struggle to adapt to feature shifts. In this work,
we propose UniVarFL, a novel FL framework that emulates IID-like training
dynamics directly at the client level, eliminating the need for global model
dependency. UniVarFL leverages two complementary regularization strategies
during local training: Classifier Variance Regularization, which aligns
class-wise probability distributions with those expected under IID conditions,
effectively mitigating local classifier bias; and Hyperspherical Uniformity
Regularization, which encourages a uniform distribution of feature
representations across the hypersphere, thereby enhancing the model's ability
to generalize under diverse data distributions. Extensive experiments on
multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that UniVarFL outperforms existing
methods in accuracy, highlighting its potential as a highly scalable and
efficient solution for real-world FL deployments, especially in
resource-constrained settings. Code: https://github.com/sunnyinAI/UniVarFL

Motivation: 探索模型性能与计算预算之间的幂律关系，并验证闭环指标是否随模型规模提升而改善，以评估开环指标在模型开发中的适用性。

Method: 使用50万小时驾驶数据集，研究模型参数数量、训练数据大小与计算预算的最优比例，并分析推理时计算扩展的影响。

Result: 模型性能随计算预算呈幂律提升；训练计算最优模型时，模型大小需以1.5倍于数据集的速度增长；小模型通过采样和聚类在推理时可与更大模型竞争。

Conclusion: 优化训练和推理时的扩展特性是提升运动预测和规划模型性能的关键，同时利用其他代理的驾驶数据可缓解机器人数据稀缺问题。

Abstract: We study the empirical scaling laws of a family of encoder-decoder
autoregressive transformer models on the task of joint motion forecasting and
planning in the autonomous driving domain. Using a 500 thousand hours driving
dataset, we demonstrate that, similar to language modeling, model performance
improves as a power-law function of the total compute budget, and we observe a
strong correlation between model training loss and model evaluation metrics.
Most interestingly, closed-loop metrics also improve with scaling, which has
important implications for the suitability of open-loop metrics for model
development and hill climbing. We also study the optimal scaling of the number
of transformer parameters and the training data size for a training
compute-optimal model. We find that as the training compute budget grows,
optimal scaling requires increasing the model size 1.5x as fast as the dataset
size. We also study inference-time compute scaling, where we observe that
sampling and clustering the output of smaller models makes them competitive
with larger models, up to a crossover point beyond which a larger models
becomes more inference-compute efficient. Overall, our experimental results
demonstrate that optimizing the training and inference-time scaling properties
of motion forecasting and planning models is a key lever for improving their
performance to address a wide variety of driving scenarios. Finally, we briefly
study the utility of training on general logged driving data of other agents to
improve the performance of the ego-agent, an important research area to address
the scarcity of robotics data for large capacity models training.

Motivation: LLM在提取临床数据时虽高效但存在可靠性、准确性和公平性挑战，现有质量保证框架未能完全解决这些问题。

Conclusion: 该框架为LLM提取的RWD提供了严格透明的评估方法，推动了行业标准并支持AI在肿瘤学研究中的可信应用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to extract clinical data
from electronic health records (EHRs), offering significant improvements in
scalability and efficiency for real-world data (RWD) curation in oncology.
However, the adoption of LLMs introduces new challenges in ensuring the
reliability, accuracy, and fairness of extracted data, which are essential for
research, regulatory, and clinical applications. Existing quality assurance
frameworks for RWD and artificial intelligence do not fully address the unique
error modes and complexities associated with LLM-extracted data. In this paper,
we propose a comprehensive framework for evaluating the quality of clinical
data extracted by LLMs. The framework integrates variable-level performance
benchmarking against expert human abstraction, automated verification checks
for internal consistency and plausibility, and replication analyses comparing
LLM-extracted data to human-abstracted datasets or external standards. This
multidimensional approach enables the identification of variables most in need
of improvement, systematic detection of latent errors, and confirmation of
dataset fitness-for-purpose in real-world research. Additionally, the framework
supports bias assessment by stratifying metrics across demographic subgroups.
By providing a rigorous and transparent method for assessing LLM-extracted RWD,
this framework advances industry standards and supports the trustworthy use of
AI-powered evidence generation in oncology research and practice.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种简单高效的近似等变性实现方式，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: Equivariant neural networks incorporate symmetries through group actions,
embedding them as an inductive bias to improve performance on a wide variety of
tasks. However, existing equivariant methods can be computationally intensive,
with high parameter counts, and are often tied to a specific architecture. We
propose a simple zero-parameter approach that imposes approximate equivariance
for a finite group in the latent representation, as an additional term in the
loss function. We conduct experiments which allow the network to learn a group
representation on the latent space, and show in every case it prefers to learn
the regular representation. Fixing this action on the latent space, this yields
a simple method to impose approximate equivariance as an additional loss
penalty. We benchmark our approach on three datasets and compare it against
several existing equivariant methods, showing that in many cases it achieves
similar or better performance for a fraction of the parameters.

TL;DR: SHIELD是一种结合超网络和区间算术的新方法，旨在同时解决灾难性遗忘和对抗攻击脆弱性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度神经网络存在灾难性遗忘和对抗攻击脆弱性问题，目前尚无模型能同时解决这两个问题。

Method: SHIELD通过超网络生成针对特定任务的目标模型权重，并结合区间算术为输入数据提供严格的安全保证。

Result: SHIELD能够动态生成子任务网络，同时确保输入数据在区间范围内的安全性。

Conclusion: SHIELD在不牺牲网络适应性的情况下增强了安全性，解决了持续学习中的安全问题。

Abstract: Traditional deep neural networks suffer from several limitations, including
catastrophic forgetting. When models are adapted to new datasets, they tend to
quickly forget previously learned knowledge. Another significant issue is the
lack of robustness to even small perturbations in the input data. In practice,
we can often easily perform adversarial attacks and change the network's
predictions, adding minimal noise to the input. Dedicated architectures and
training procedures can solve each of the above problems separately.
Unfortunately, currently, no model can simultaneously address both catastrophic
forgetting and vulnerability to adversarial attacks. We introduce SHIELD
(Secure Hypernetworks for Incremental Expansion and Learning Defense), a novel
approach that integrates a hypernetwork-based continual learning approach with
interval arithmetic. SHIELD use the hypernetwork to transfer trainable task
embedding vectors into the weights of a target model dedicated to specific
data. This paradigm allows for the dynamic generation of separate networks for
each subtask, while the hypernetwork aggregates and analyzes information across
all tasks. The target model takes in the input a data sample with a defined
interval range, and by creating a hypercube, produces a prediction for the
given range. Therefore, such target models provide strict guarantees against
all possible attacks for data samples within the interval range. Our approach
enhances security without sacrificing network adaptability, addressing the
overlooked challenge of safety in continual learning.

Conclusion: HC-RLHF为语言模型对齐提供了可靠的安全保障，同时提升了性能。

Abstract: Existing approaches to language model alignment often treat safety as a
tradeoff against helpfulness, which can lead to unacceptable responses in
sensitive domains. To ensure reliable performance in such settings, we propose
High-Confidence Safe Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (HC-RLHF), a
method that provides high-confidence safety guarantees while maximizing
helpfulness. Similar to previous methods, HC-RLHF explicitly decouples human
preferences into helpfulness and harmlessness (safety), which are learned by
training a reward model and a cost model, respectively. It then employs a
two-step process to find safe solutions. In the first step, it optimizes the
reward function under an intentionally pessimistic version of the cost
constraint. In the second step, the trained model undergoes a safety test to
verify whether its performance stays within an upper-confidence bound of the
actual cost constraint. We provide a theoretical analysis of HC-RLHF, including
proof that it will not return an unsafe solution with a probability greater
than a user-specified threshold. For our empirical analysis, we apply HC-RLHF
to align three different language models (Qwen2-1.5B, Qwen2.5-3B, and
LLaMa3.2-3B) with human preferences. Our results demonstrate that HC-RLHF
produces safe models with high probability and can improve harmlessness and
helpfulness compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: LIES框架有效解决了符号回归的可扩展性和一致性问题，并通过消融研究验证了各设计组件的必要性。

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) aims to discover closed-form mathematical
expressions that accurately describe data, offering interpretability and
analytical insight beyond standard black-box models. Existing SR methods often
rely on population-based search or autoregressive modeling, which struggle with
scalability and symbolic consistency. We introduce LIES (Logarithm, Identity,
Exponential, Sine), a fixed neural network architecture with interpretable
primitive activations that are optimized to model symbolic expressions. We
develop a framework to extract compact formulae from LIES networks by training
with an appropriate oversampling strategy and a tailored loss function to
promote sparsity and to prevent gradient instability. After training, it
applies additional pruning strategies to further simplify the learned
expressions into compact formulae. Our experiments on SR benchmarks show that
the LIES framework consistently produces sparse and accurate symbolic formulae
outperforming all baselines. We also demonstrate the importance of each design
component through ablation studies.

Result: L-STEP在13个经典数据集和TGB基准测试中表现优异，计算效率高于现有方法。

Conclusion: L-STEP是一种高效且有效的时空位置编码方法，适用于动态图数据的链接预测任务。

Abstract: Accurate predictions rely on the expressiveness power of graph deep learning
frameworks like graph neural networks and graph transformers, where a
positional encoding mechanism has become much more indispensable in recent
state-of-the-art works to record the canonical position information. However,
the current positional encoding is limited in three aspects: (1) most
positional encoding methods use pre-defined, and fixed functions, which are
inadequate to adapt to the complex attributed graphs; (2) a few pioneering
works proposed the learnable positional encoding but are still limited to the
structural information, not considering the real-world time-evolving
topological and feature information; (3) most positional encoding methods are
equipped with transformers' attention mechanism to fully leverage their
capabilities, where the dense or relational attention is often unaffordable on
large-scale structured data. Hence, we aim to develop Learnable
Spatial-Temporal Positional Encoding in an effective and efficient manner and
propose a simple temporal link prediction model named L-STEP. Briefly, for
L-STEP, we (1) prove the proposed positional learning scheme can preserve the
graph property from the spatial-temporal spectral viewpoint, (2) verify that
MLPs can fully exploit the expressiveness and reach transformers' performance
on that encoding, (3) change different initial positional encoding inputs to
show robustness, (4) analyze the theoretical complexity and obtain less
empirical running time than SOTA, and (5) demonstrate its temporal link
prediction out-performance on 13 classic datasets and with 10 algorithms in
both transductive and inductive settings using 3 different sampling strategies.

Conclusion: Bingo证明了通过显式训练语言模型可以实现高效推理，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities,
yet they often suffer from inefficiencies due to unnecessarily verbose or
redundant outputs. While many works have explored reinforcement learning (RL)
to enhance reasoning abilities, most primarily focus on improving accuracy,
with limited attention to reasoning efficiency. Some existing approaches
introduce direct length-based rewards to encourage brevity, but this often
leads to noticeable drops in accuracy. In this paper, we propose Bingo, an RL
framework that advances length-based reward design to boost efficient
reasoning. Bingo incorporates two key mechanisms: a significance-aware length
reward, which gradually guides the model to reduce only insignificant tokens,
and a dynamic length reward, which initially encourages elaborate reasoning for
hard questions but decays over time to improve overall efficiency. Experiments
across multiple reasoning benchmarks show that Bingo improves both accuracy and
efficiency. It outperforms the vanilla reward and several other length-based
reward baselines in RL, achieving a favorable trade-off between accuracy and
efficiency. These results underscore the potential of training LLMs explicitly
for efficient reasoning.

Abstract: Graph learning models have demonstrated great prowess in learning expressive
representations from large-scale graph data in a wide variety of real-world
scenarios. As a prevalent strategy for training powerful graph learning models,
the "pre-training, adaptation" scheme first pre-trains graph learning models on
unlabeled graph data in a self-supervised manner and then adapts them to
specific downstream tasks. During the adaptation phase, graph prompting emerges
as a promising approach that learns trainable prompts while keeping the
pre-trained graph learning models unchanged. In this paper, we present a
systematic review of recent advancements in graph prompting. First, we
introduce representative graph pre-training methods that serve as the
foundation step of graph prompting. Next, we review mainstream techniques in
graph prompting and elaborate on how they design learnable prompts for graph
prompting. Furthermore, we summarize the real-world applications of graph
prompting from different domains. Finally, we discuss several open challenges
in existing studies with promising future directions in this field.

Conclusion: ECON通过均衡策略显著提升了多LLM协调的效率和性能，为更大规模的多智能体系统提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Multi-agent frameworks can substantially boost the reasoning power of large
language models (LLMs), but they typically incur heavy computational costs and
lack convergence guarantees. To overcome these challenges, we recast multi-LLM
coordination as an incomplete-information game and seek a Bayesian Nash
equilibrium (BNE), in which each agent optimally responds to its probabilistic
beliefs about the strategies of others. We introduce Efficient Coordination via
Nash Equilibrium (ECON), a hierarchical reinforcement-learning paradigm that
marries distributed reasoning with centralized final output. Under ECON, each
LLM independently selects responses that maximize its expected reward,
conditioned on its beliefs about co-agents, without requiring costly
inter-agent exchanges. We mathematically prove that ECON attains a markedly
tighter regret bound than non-equilibrium multi-agent schemes. Empirically,
ECON outperforms existing multi-LLM approaches by 11.2% on average across six
benchmarks spanning complex reasoning and planning tasks. Further experiments
demonstrate ECON's ability to flexibly incorporate additional models,
confirming its scalability and paving the way toward larger, more powerful
multi-LLM ensembles. The code is publicly available at:

TL;DR: AR-Bench是一个新基准，用于评估大型语言模型（LLM）的主动推理能力，发现当前LLM在主动推理方面表现较差。


<details>

Motivation: 现有基准主要评估被动推理，而主动推理（需与外部系统交互获取信息）缺乏系统研究。

Method: 设计了AR-Bench，包含三类任务（侦探案例、情境谜题和猜数字），模拟真实场景并测试常识、逻辑和符号推理能力。

Result: 当前LLM在主动推理上表现不佳，即使采用高级策略（如树搜索或后训练方法）改进有限。

Conclusion: 需发展新方法（如交互学习、实时反馈和环境感知目标）提升主动推理能力，AR-Bench已公开。

Abstract: While existing benchmarks probe the reasoning abilities of large language
models (LLMs) across diverse domains, they predominantly assess passive
reasoning, providing models with all the information needed to reach a
solution. By contrast, active reasoning-where an LLM must interact with
external systems to acquire missing evidence or data-has received little
systematic attention. To address this shortfall, we present AR-Bench, a novel
benchmark designed explicitly to evaluate an LLM's active reasoning skills.
AR-Bench comprises three task families-detective cases, situation puzzles, and
guessing numbers-that together simulate real-world, agentic scenarios and
measure performance across commonsense, logical, and symbolic reasoning
challenges. Empirical evaluation on AR-Bench demonstrates that contemporary
LLMs exhibit pronounced difficulties with active reasoning: they frequently
fail to acquire or leverage the information needed to solve tasks. This gap
highlights a stark divergence between their passive and active reasoning
abilities. Moreover, ablation studies indicate that even advanced strategies,
such as tree-based searching or post-training approaches, yield only modest
gains and fall short of the levels required for real-world deployment.
Collectively, these findings highlight the critical need to advance methodology
for active reasoning, e.g., incorporating interactive learning, real-time
feedback loops, and environment-aware objectives for training. The benchmark is

### [264] [Reinforce LLM Reasoning through Multi-Agent Reflection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08379)
*Yurun Yuan,Tengyang Xie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出DPSDP算法，通过强化学习训练LLM系统迭代优化答案，提升推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法反馈空间受限且缺乏协调训练，导致性能不佳。

Method: 将多轮优化过程建模为马尔可夫决策过程，提出DPSDP算法，基于自生成数据直接偏好学习训练actor-critic LLM系统。

Result: 在MATH 500基准上，五步优化将准确率从58.2%提升至63.2%。

Conclusion: DPSDP通过多智能体协作和分布外泛化显著提升性能。

Abstract: Leveraging more test-time computation has proven to be an effective way to
boost the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Among various
methods, the verify-and-improve paradigm stands out for enabling dynamic
solution exploration and feedback incorporation. However, existing approaches
often suffer from restricted feedback spaces and lack of coordinated training
of different parties, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we
model this multi-turn refinement process as a Markov Decision Process and
introduce DPSDP (Direct Policy Search by Dynamic Programming), a reinforcement
learning algorithm that trains an actor-critic LLM system to iteratively refine
answers via direct preference learning on self-generated data. Theoretically,
DPSDP can match the performance of any policy within the training distribution.
Empirically, we instantiate DPSDP with various base models and show
improvements on both in- and out-of-distribution benchmarks. For example, on
benchmark MATH 500, majority voting over five refinement steps increases
first-turn accuracy from 58.2% to 63.2% with Ministral-based models. An
ablation study further confirms the benefits of multi-agent collaboration and
out-of-distribution generalization.

<details>

Conclusion: RLTs框架显著提升了推理语言模型的效率和可重用性，为未来的蒸馏和冷启动提供了新方向。

Abstract: Training reasoning language models (LMs) with reinforcement learning (RL) for
one-hot correctness inherently relies on the LM being able to explore and solve
its task with some chance at initialization. Furthermore, a key use case of
reasoning LMs is to act as teachers for distilling new students and
cold-starting future RL iterations rather than being deployed themselves. From
these considerations, we introduce a new framework that avoids RL's exploration
challenge by training a new class of Reinforcement-Learned Teachers (RLTs)
focused on yielding the most effective downstream distillation. RLTs are
prompted with both the question and solution to each problem, and tasked to
simply "connect-the-dots" with detailed explanations tailored for their
students. We train RLTs with dense rewards obtained by feeding each explanation
to the student and testing its understanding of the problem's solution. In
practice, the raw outputs of a 7B RLT provide higher final performance on
competition and graduate-level tasks than existing distillation and
cold-starting pipelines that collect and postprocess the reasoning traces of
orders of magnitude larger LMs. Furthermore, RLTs maintain their effectiveness
when training larger students and when applied zero-shot to out-of-distribution
tasks, unlocking new levels of efficiency and re-usability for the RL reasoning
framework.

*Vamshika Sutar,Amandeep Singh,Rohitash Chandra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合深度学习和数据增强的方法，用于检测气旋快速增强事件，解决了数据集类别不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 气旋快速增强是一种极端事件，其罕见性导致数据集类别不平衡，传统机器学习模型难以处理。

Result: 数据增强显著提高了快速增强事件的检测效果，空间坐标作为输入特征至关重要。

Conclusion: 该方法为时空数据中极端事件的合成数据生成研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Cyclone rapid intensification is the rapid increase in cyclone wind
intensity, exceeding a threshold of 30 knots, within 24 hours. Rapid
intensification is considered an extreme event during a cyclone, and its
occurrence is relatively rare, contributing to a class imbalance in the
dataset. A diverse array of factors influences the likelihood of a cyclone
undergoing rapid intensification, further complicating the task for
conventional machine learning models. In this paper, we evaluate deep learning,
ensemble learning and data augmentation frameworks to detect cyclone rapid
intensification based on wind intensity and spatial coordinates. We note that
conventional data augmentation methods cannot be utilised for generating
spatiotemporal patterns replicating cyclones that undergo rapid
intensification. Therefore, our framework employs deep learning models to
generate spatial coordinates and wind intensity that replicate cyclones to
address the class imbalance problem of rapid intensification. We also use a
deep learning model for the classification module within the data augmentation
framework to differentiate between rapid and non-rapid intensification events
during a cyclone. Our results show that data augmentation improves the results
for rapid intensification detection in cyclones, and spatial coordinates play a
critical role as input features to the given models. This paves the way for
research in synthetic data generation for spatiotemporal data with extreme
events.

*Waiss Azizian,Michael Kirchhof,Eugene Ndiaye,Louis Bethune,Michal Klein,Pierre Ablin,Marco Cuturi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现，尽管LLMs的激活模式可用于区分答案正确性，但这种“真理几何”是任务依赖的，无法跨任务迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs激活模式在跨任务中的可靠性，揭示现有方法的局限性。

Method: 通过线性分类器分析不同任务中的激活模式，并尝试更复杂的方法（如混合探测）。

Result: 线性分类器在不同任务中表现差异大，激活向量跨任务时形成明显分离的簇。

Conclusion: 现有方法无法克服任务依赖性，激活模式的跨任务迁移性有限。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive generalization
capabilities across various tasks, but their claim to practical relevance is
still mired by concerns on their reliability. Recent works have proposed
examining the activations produced by an LLM at inference time to assess
whether its answer to a question is correct. Some works claim that a "geometry
of truth" can be learned from examples, in the sense that the activations that
generate correct answers can be distinguished from those leading to mistakes
with a linear classifier. In this work, we underline a limitation of these
approaches: we observe that these "geometries of truth" are intrinsically
task-dependent and fail to transfer across tasks. More precisely, we show that
linear classifiers trained across distinct tasks share little similarity and,
when trained with sparsity-enforcing regularizers, have almost disjoint
supports. We show that more sophisticated approaches (e.g., using mixtures of
probes and tasks) fail to overcome this limitation, likely because activation
vectors commonly used to classify answers form clearly separated clusters when
examined across tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新方法SQOG，通过平滑贝尔曼算子（SBO）在凸包及其邻域（CHN）内增强Q函数泛化能力，解决了离线RL中Q值高估问题，并在D4RL基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线RL中，分布偏移导致Q值对分布外（OOD）动作的高估，现有方法因约束过强限制了Q函数泛化能力，影响了策略改进。

Method: 提出平滑贝尔曼算子（SBO），在CHN内通过平滑OOD Q值与邻近样本内Q值来更新Q值，理论上证明其能近似真实Q值。

Result: SQOG算法在D4RL基准测试中优于现有方法，实现了接近准确的Q值估计，且计算效率高。

Conclusion: SQOG通过CHN内的安全泛化保证和SBO，有效缓解了离线RL中的过约束问题，提升了Q值估计和策略性能。

Abstract: Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) struggles with distributional shifts,
leading to the $Q$-value overestimation for out-of-distribution (OOD) actions.
Existing methods address this issue by imposing constraints; however, they
often become overly conservative when evaluating OOD regions, which constrains
the $Q$-function generalization. This over-constraint issue results in poor
$Q$-value estimation and hinders policy improvement. In this paper, we
introduce a novel approach to achieve better $Q$-value estimation by enhancing
$Q$-function generalization in OOD regions within Convex Hull and its
Neighborhood (CHN). Under the safety generalization guarantees of the CHN, we
propose the Smooth Bellman Operator (SBO), which updates OOD $Q$-values by
smoothing them with neighboring in-sample $Q$-values. We theoretically show
that SBO approximates true $Q$-values for both in-sample and OOD actions within
the CHN. Our practical algorithm, Smooth Q-function OOD Generalization (SQOG),
empirically alleviates the over-constraint issue, achieving near-accurate
$Q$-value estimation. On the D4RL benchmarks, SQOG outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods in both performance and computational efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应控制批量大小和模型分割的方法（HASFL），以解决分裂联邦学习中的异构性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分裂联邦学习方法因边缘设备能力异构性导致性能下降，亟需解决方案。

Method: 通过推导收敛边界，设计HASFL框架，自适应调整批量大小和模型分割。

Result: 实验验证HASFL优于现有方法，有效平衡通信计算延迟与训练收敛。

Conclusion: HASFL为异构边缘网络中的分裂联邦学习提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Split federated learning (SFL) has emerged as a promising paradigm to
democratize machine learning (ML) on edge devices by enabling layer-wise model
partitioning. However, existing SFL approaches suffer significantly from the
straggler effect due to the heterogeneous capabilities of edge devices. To
address the fundamental challenge, we propose adaptively controlling batch
sizes (BSs) and model splitting (MS) for edge devices to overcome resource
heterogeneity. We first derive a tight convergence bound of SFL that quantifies
the impact of varied BSs and MS on learning performance. Based on the
convergence bound, we propose HASFL, a heterogeneity-aware SFL framework
capable of adaptively controlling BS and MS to balance communication-computing
latency and training convergence in heterogeneous edge networks. Extensive
experiments with various datasets validate the effectiveness of HASFL and
demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art benchmarks.

TL;DR: TAWM是一种基于时间感知的世界模型，通过动态调整时间步长来学习任务的高低频动态，显著提升性能和数据效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型通常固定时间步长采样，无法适应不同动态频率的任务需求。TAWM旨在通过时间感知设计，优化采样率以更好地捕捉系统动态。

Method: TAWM通过条件化时间步长Δt，并在多样化的Δt值上训练，学习任务的高低频动态。基于信息论，动态调整采样率。

Result: 实验表明，TAWM在不同观测率下均优于传统模型，且训练样本和迭代次数相同。

Conclusion: TAWM通过时间感知设计，显著提升了模型性能和数据效率，适用于多样化的控制任务。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the Time-Aware World Model (TAWM), a model-based
approach that explicitly incorporates temporal dynamics. By conditioning on the
time-step size, {\Delta}t, and training over a diverse range of {\Delta}t
values -- rather than sampling at a fixed time-step -- TAWM learns both high-
and low-frequency task dynamics across diverse control problems. Grounded in
the information-theoretic insight that the optimal sampling rate depends on a
system's underlying dynamics, this time-aware formulation improves both
performance and data efficiency. Empirical evaluations show that TAWM
consistently outperforms conventional models across varying observation rates
in a variety of control tasks, using the same number of training samples and
iterations. Our code can be found online at:

methodology achieves 92.9% average accuracy in placing over 10 million refugee
observations into appropriate grid cells, enabling the identification of
localized displacement patterns previously obscured in broader regional and

TL;DR: MOBODY是一种基于模型的离线强化学习算法，通过生成目标域的新合成转换来解决源域和目标域动态不匹配的问题，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法受限于目标域的有限转换数据，无法探索目标域。MOBODY旨在通过学习动态模型生成新数据，突破这一限制。

Result: 在MuJoCo基准测试中，MOBODY显著优于现有方法，尤其在挑战性场景中表现突出。

Conclusion: MOBODY通过动态模型生成和跨域表示学习，有效解决了动态不匹配问题，提升了离线强化学习的性能。

Abstract: We study the off-dynamics offline reinforcement learning problem, where the
goal is to learn a policy from offline datasets collected from source and
target domains with mismatched transition. Existing off-dynamics offline RL
methods typically either filter source transitions that resemble those of the
target domain or apply reward augmentation to source data, both constrained by
the limited transitions available from the target domain. As a result, the
learned policy is unable to explore target domain beyond the offline datasets.
We propose MOBODY, a Model-Based Off-Dynamics offline RL algorithm that
addresses this limitation by enabling exploration of the target domain via
learned dynamics. MOBODY generates new synthetic transitions in the target
domain through model rollouts, which are used as data augmentation during
offline policy learning. Unlike existing model-based methods that learn
dynamics from a single domain, MOBODY tackles the challenge of mismatched
dynamics by leveraging both source and target datasets. Directly merging these
datasets can bias the learned model toward source dynamics. Instead, MOBODY
learns target dynamics by discovering a shared latent representation of states
and transitions across domains through representation learning. To stabilize
training, MOBODY incorporates a behavior cloning loss that regularizes the
policy. Specifically, we introduce a Q-weighted behavior cloning loss that
regularizes the policy toward actions with high target-domain Q-values, rather
than uniformly imitating all actions in the dataset. These Q-values are learned
from an enhanced target dataset composed of offline target data, augmented
source data, and rollout data from the learned target dynamics. We evaluate
MOBODY on MuJoCo benchmarks and show that it significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, with especially pronounced improvements in
challenging scenarios.

TL;DR: Reinforced RCSL通过引入“分布内最优未来回报”机制，解决了传统RCSL缺乏拼接能力的问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RCSL因依赖离线数据集的质量而性能受限，缺乏拼接能力。

Method: 提出Reinforced RCSL框架，引入“分布内最优未来回报”机制，避免复杂回报增强技术。

Result: 理论分析和实验结果表明，Reinforced RCSL优于标准RCSL，性能显著提升。

Conclusion: Reinforced RCSL是一种简单且有效的改进方法，解决了RCSL的核心限制。

Abstract: In sequential decision-making problems, Return-Conditioned Supervised
Learning (RCSL) has gained increasing recognition for its simplicity and
stability in modern decision-making tasks. Unlike traditional offline
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, RCSL frames policy learning as a
supervised learning problem by taking both the state and return as input. This
approach eliminates the instability often associated with temporal difference
(TD) learning in offline RL. However, RCSL has been criticized for lacking the
stitching property, meaning its performance is inherently limited by the
quality of the policy used to generate the offline dataset. To address this
limitation, we propose a principled and simple framework called Reinforced
RCSL. The key innovation of our framework is the introduction of a concept we
call the in-distribution optimal return-to-go. This mechanism leverages our
policy to identify the best achievable in-dataset future return based on the
current state, avoiding the need for complex return augmentation techniques.
Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that Reinforced RCSL can consistently
outperform the standard RCSL approach. Empirical results further validate our
claims, showing significant performance improvements across a range of
benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集缺乏高质量、可验证的数学问题，且问题合成策略未考虑模型能力，导致效率低下。

Method: SwS框架通过识别模型在强化学习中的失败问题，提取核心概念并合成新问题，以针对性增强模型弱点。

Result: 在7B和32B模型上，SwS框架在八个主流推理基准上平均性能提升了10.0%和7.7%。

Conclusion: SwS框架通过自我识别和解决弱点，显著提升了模型在复杂推理任务中的表现。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has proven effective
for training large language models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks, such as
mathematical problem solving. A prerequisite for the scalability of RLVR is a
high-quality problem set with precise and verifiable answers. However, the
scarcity of well-crafted human-labeled math problems and limited-verification
answers in existing distillation-oriented synthetic datasets limit their
effectiveness in RL. Additionally, most problem synthesis strategies
indiscriminately expand the problem set without considering the model's
capabilities, leading to low efficiency in generating useful questions. To
mitigate this issue, we introduce a Self-aware Weakness-driven problem
Synthesis framework (SwS) that systematically identifies model deficiencies and
leverages them for problem augmentation. Specifically, we define weaknesses as
questions that the model consistently fails to learn through its iterative
sampling during RL training. We then extract the core concepts from these
failure cases and synthesize new problems to strengthen the model's weak areas
in subsequent augmented training, enabling it to focus on and gradually
overcome its weaknesses. Without relying on external knowledge distillation,
our framework enables robust generalization byempowering the model to
self-identify and address its weaknesses in RL, yielding average performance
gains of 10.0% and 7.7% on 7B and 32B models across eight mainstream reasoning
benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理模型在测试时难以实现性能外推，尤其是在超出训练预算的情况下。

Method: 通过训练LLM进行上下文探索，包括链式操作、利用负梯度强化探索，以及设计训练课程。

Result: e3方法在1.7B模型上实现了最佳性能，并能外推到2倍训练预算。

Conclusion: e3方法不仅提高了单次推理的准确率，还提升了多次推理的性能。

Abstract: Test-time scaling offers a promising path to improve LLM reasoning by
utilizing more compute at inference time; however, the true promise of this
paradigm lies in extrapolation (i.e., improvement in performance on hard
problems as LLMs keep "thinking" for longer, beyond the maximum token budget
they were trained on). Surprisingly, we find that most existing reasoning
models do not extrapolate well. We show that one way to enable extrapolation is
by training the LLM to perform in-context exploration: training the LLM to
effectively spend its test time budget by chaining operations (such as
generation, verification, refinement, etc.), or testing multiple hypotheses
before it commits to an answer. To enable in-context exploration, we identify
three key ingredients as part of our recipe e3: (1) chaining skills that the
base LLM has asymmetric competence in, e.g., chaining verification (easy) with
generation (hard), as a way to implement in-context search; (2) leveraging
"negative" gradients from incorrect traces to amplify exploration during RL,
resulting in longer search traces that chains additional asymmetries; and (3)
coupling task difficulty with training token budget during training via a
specifically-designed curriculum to structure in-context exploration. Our
recipe e3 produces the best known 1.7B model according to AIME'25 and HMMT'25
scores, and extrapolates to 2x the training token budget. Our e3-1.7B model not
only attains high pass@1 scores, but also improves pass@k over the base model.

Result: 实验表明该方法提高了获取可证明充分解释的效率，并提供了网络预测的细粒度解释。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了可证明充分解释的计算效率，同时支持跨不同抽象层次的网络预测解释。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in post-hoc explainability techniques for
neural networks, many current methods rely on heuristics and do not provide
formally provable guarantees over the explanations provided. Recent work has
shown that it is possible to obtain explanations with formal guarantees by
identifying subsets of input features that are sufficient to determine that
predictions remain unchanged using neural network verification techniques.
Despite the appeal of these explanations, their computation faces significant
scalability challenges. In this work, we address this gap by proposing a novel
abstraction-refinement technique for efficiently computing provably sufficient
explanations of neural network predictions. Our method abstracts the original
large neural network by constructing a substantially reduced network, where a
sufficient explanation of the reduced network is also provably sufficient for
the original network, hence significantly speeding up the verification process.
If the explanation is in sufficient on the reduced network, we iteratively
refine the network size by gradually increasing it until convergence. Our
experiments demonstrate that our approach enhances the efficiency of obtaining
provably sufficient explanations for neural network predictions while
additionally providing a fine-grained interpretation of the network's
predictions across different abstraction levels.

Abstract: This paper introduces Evolutionary Multi-Objective Network Architecture
Search (EMNAS) for the first time to optimize neural network architectures in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习（FL）因其隐私保护能力备受关注，但梯度泄漏攻击（GLAs）的威胁引发争议。本文旨在填补这一关键空白，证明GLAs在实际FL环境中仍具威胁。

Method: 提出FedLeak方法，引入部分梯度匹配和梯度正则化技术，并制定基于文献和行业实践的实际评估协议。

Result: FedLeak在现实FL环境中仍能实现高保真数据重构，揭示了FL系统的重大漏洞。

Conclusion: FL系统存在显著隐私风险，亟需更有效的防御方法。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training among multiple
clients without the need to expose raw data. Its ability to safeguard privacy,
at the heart of FL, has recently been a hot-button debate topic. To elaborate,
several studies have introduced a type of attacks known as gradient leakage
attacks (GLAs), which exploit the gradients shared during training to
reconstruct clients' raw data. On the flip side, some literature, however,
contends no substantial privacy risk in practical FL environments due to the
effectiveness of such GLAs being limited to overly relaxed conditions, such as
small batch sizes and knowledge of clients' data distributions.
  This paper bridges this critical gap by empirically demonstrating that
clients' data can still be effectively reconstructed, even within realistic FL
environments. Upon revisiting GLAs, we recognize that their performance
failures stem from their inability to handle the gradient matching problem. To
alleviate the performance bottlenecks identified above, we develop FedLeak,
which introduces two novel techniques, partial gradient matching and gradient
regularization. Moreover, to evaluate the performance of FedLeak in real-world
FL environments, we formulate a practical evaluation protocol grounded in a
thorough review of extensive FL literature and industry practices. Under this
protocol, FedLeak can still achieve high-fidelity data reconstruction, thereby
underscoring the significant vulnerability in FL systems and the urgent need
for more effective defense methods.

TL;DR: HSG-12M是首个大规模空间多图数据集，保留了节点间多条几何路径，基于1-D晶体的能谱数据生成，为几何感知图学习奠定基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图基准假设边是非空间且简单的，忽略了物理上不同的路径。HSG-12M旨在填补这一空白，提供更真实的几何多图数据。

Method: 通过Poly2Graph管道，将1-D晶体的哈密顿量映射为谱图，生成静态和动态的Hamiltonian谱图。

Result: HSG-12M包含1160万静态和510万动态谱图，覆盖1401个特征多项式类，展示了多边几何学习的挑战。

Conclusion: HSG-12M为几何感知图学习提供了新工具，并在凝聚态物理等领域开辟了数据驱动科学发现的新机会。

Abstract: Existing graph benchmarks assume non-spatial, simple edges, collapsing
physically distinct paths into a single link. We introduce HSG-12M, the first
large-scale dataset of $\textbf{spatial multigraphs}-$graphs embedded in a
metric space where multiple geometrically distinct trajectories between two
nodes are retained as separate edges. HSG-12M contains 11.6 million static and
5.1 million dynamic $\textit{Hamiltonian spectral graphs}$ across 1401
characteristic-polynomial classes, derived from 177 TB of spectral potential
data. Each graph encodes the full geometry of a 1-D crystal's energy spectrum
on the complex plane, producing diverse, physics-grounded topologies that
transcend conventional node-coordinate datasets. To enable future extensions,
we release $\texttt{Poly2Graph}$: a high-performance, open-source pipeline that
maps arbitrary 1-D crystal Hamiltonians to spectral graphs. Benchmarks with
popular GNNs expose new challenges in learning from multi-edge geometry at
scale. Beyond its practical utility, we show that spectral graphs serve as
universal topological fingerprints of polynomials, vectors, and matrices,
forging a new algebra-to-graph link. HSG-12M lays the groundwork for
geometry-aware graph learning and new opportunities of data-driven scientific
discovery in condensed matter physics and beyond.

processes multivariate time series data, our system excels at capturing complex
correlations across diverse environmental signals, enabling robust predictions
even during extreme weather events. To strengthen the model's reliability, we
further calibrate its predictions with a conformal inference technique,
tailored for probabilistic time series data, ensuring that the resulting
prediction intervals are statistically reliable and cover the true target
values with a desired confidence level. Our empirical tests on real sewerage
system data confirm the model's exceptional capability to deliver reliable
contextual predictions, maintaining accuracy even under severe weather
conditions.

TL;DR: TiViT框架将时间序列转换为图像，利用预训练的Vision Transformers（ViTs）提升时间序列分类性能，并在标准基准测试中达到最优表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列分类在医疗和工业领域至关重要，但公开时间序列数据集的稀缺限制了时间序列基础模型（TSFMs）的发展。

Method: 提出Time Vision Transformer（TiViT），将时间序列转换为图像，利用预训练的ViTs提取特征，并通过分析2D分块和OpenCLIP模型的隐藏表示优化性能。

Result: TiViT在标准时间序列分类基准测试中表现最优，且中间层的高内在维度对分类最有效。TiViT与TSFM表示空间互补，结合特征可进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: TiViT展示了在非视觉领域复用视觉表示的新方向，为时间序列分类提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Time series classification is a fundamental task in healthcare and industry,
yet the development of time series foundation models (TSFMs) remains limited by
the scarcity of publicly available time series datasets. In this work, we
propose Time Vision Transformer (TiViT), a framework that converts time series
into images to leverage the representational power of frozen Vision
Transformers (ViTs) pretrained on large-scale image datasets. First, we
theoretically motivate our approach by analyzing the 2D patching of ViTs for
time series, showing that it can increase the number of label-relevant tokens
and reduce the sample complexity. Second, we empirically demonstrate that TiViT
achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard time series classification
benchmarks by utilizing the hidden representations of large OpenCLIP models. We
explore the structure of TiViT representations and find that intermediate
layers with high intrinsic dimension are the most effective for time series
classification. Finally, we assess the alignment between TiViT and TSFM
representation spaces and identify a strong complementarity, with further
performance gains achieved by combining their features. Our findings reveal yet
another direction for reusing vision representations in a non-visual domain.

<details>

Motivation: 现有生成方法（如扩散模型和流匹配）通常从数据中隐式学习物理规律，缺乏显式物理约束。

Method: PBFM结合流匹配损失和基于物理的残差损失，引入时间展开训练，无需超参数调优。

Result: 在三个代表性PDE问题上，PBFM的物理残差比FM准确8倍，且在分布准确性上优于现有算法。

Conclusion: PBFM为物理和工程应用中的代理建模、不确定性量化和加速模拟提供了高效框架。

Abstract: Generative machine learning methods, such as diffusion models and flow
matching, have shown great potential in modeling complex system behaviors and
building efficient surrogate models. However, these methods typically learn the
underlying physics implicitly from data. We propose Physics-Based Flow Matching
(PBFM), a novel generative framework that explicitly embeds physical
constraints, both PDE residuals and algebraic relations, into the flow matching
objective. We also introduce temporal unrolling at training time that improves
the accuracy of the final, noise-free sample prediction. Our method jointly
minimizes the flow matching loss and the physics-based residual loss without
requiring hyperparameter tuning of their relative weights. Additionally, we
analyze the role of the minimum noise level, $\sigma_{\min}$, in the context of
physical constraints and evaluate a stochastic sampling strategy that helps to
reduce physical residuals. Through extensive benchmarks on three representative
PDE problems, we show that our approach yields up to an $8\times$ more accurate
physical residuals compared to FM, while clearly outperforming existing
algorithms in terms of distributional accuracy. PBFM thus provides a principled
and efficient framework for surrogate modeling, uncertainty quantification, and
accelerated simulation in physics and engineering applications.

Motivation: Transformer在序列建模中表现出色，但如何有效融入位置信息仍是一个挑战。JoFormer旨在通过非交换代数方法扩展和泛化现有位置表示方法。

Method: JoFormer采用可学习的定向变换，沿输入序列顺序组合相对位置表示，其注意力机制从第一性原理推导，涵盖标准方法如旋转变换。

Result: 在Tiny Shakespeare字符级语言建模任务中，JoFormer比RoFormer基线模型表现更好，困惑度更低且收敛更快。

Conclusion: JoFormer为Transformer架构提供了一种原则性的位置结构集成方法，展示了其作为更富表达力架构原型的潜力。

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated remarkable success in sequence modeling, yet
effectively incorporating positional information remains a challenging and
active area of research. In this paper, we introduce JoFormer, a journey-based
Transformer architecture grounded in a recently proposed non-commutative
algebra for composing transformations across positions. JoFormer represents
relative positions through learnable directional transforms that are
sequentially composed along the input, thereby extending and generalizing
existing approaches based on relative position representations. We derive the
JoFormer attention mechanism from first principles and show that it subsumes
standard methods such as rotary transformations as special cases. To evaluate
its effectiveness, we compare JoFormer to the RoFormer baseline on the Tiny
Shakespeare character-level language modeling task. Our results demonstrate
that
  JoFormer consistently achieves lower perplexity and faster convergence,
highlighting the advantages of its more expressive, journey-based treatment of
position. Notably, the per-token JoFormer is still a primitive, conceptual
variant with layer-independent angles, yet it already demonstrates strong
performance-underscoring its promise as a proof of concept for more expressive
architectures. We conclude by discussing how JoFormer offers a principled
approach to integrating positional structure into Transformer architectures.

TL;DR: ChannelTokenFormer是一种基于Transformer的预测模型，旨在解决多变量时间序列数据中的通道依赖性、异步采样和缺失值问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的时间序列数据通常是多变量的，具有复杂的通道间依赖性，且采样异步和缺失值问题普遍存在，而现有模型对此处理不足。

Method: 提出ChannelTokenFormer，通过灵活的架构显式捕捉跨通道交互，适应异步采样，并有效处理缺失值。

Result: 在三个基准数据集和一个真实工业数据集上的实验表明，ChannelTokenFormer在复杂现实条件下具有优越的鲁棒性和准确性。

Conclusion: ChannelTokenFormer为解决现实世界时间序列预测中的关键挑战提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Real-world time series data are inherently multivariate, often exhibiting
complex inter-channel dependencies. Each channel is typically sampled at its
own period and is prone to missing values due to various practical and
operational constraints. These characteristics pose fundamental challenges
related to channel dependency, sampling asynchrony, and missingness, all of
which must be addressed to enable robust and reliable forecasting in practical
settings. However, most existing architectures are built on oversimplified
assumptions, such as identical sampling periods across channels and fully
observed inputs at test time, which often do not hold in real-world scenarios.
To bridge this gap, we propose ChannelTokenFormer, a Transformer-based
forecasting model with a flexible architecture designed to explicitly capture
cross-channel interactions, accommodate channel-wise asynchronous sampling, and
effectively handle missing values. Extensive experiments on three benchmark
datasets modified to reflect practical settings, along with one real-world
industrial dataset, demonstrate the superior robustness and accuracy of
ChannelTokenFormer under challenging real-world conditions.

*Florian Borzechowski,Michael Schäfer,Heiko Schwarz,Jonathan Pfaff,Detlev Marpe,Thomas Wiegand*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对变分自编码器图像压缩的额外微调训练步骤，以解决量化噪声建模不准确的问题，从而提升编码效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在训练过程中难以正确建模量化噪声，导致网络性能次优，尤其是在熵约束量化器（如Trellis-Coded Quantization）中。

Method: 在传统端到端训练后，对网络部分进行基于推理阶段量化潜在表示的微调训练。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在Kodak和TecNick测试集上分别实现了1%-2%和最高2.2%的Bj{\o}ntegaard-Delta比特率节省。

Conclusion: 通过正确量化数据的微调训练，可以在不增加推理复杂度的情况下显著提升编码效率。

Abstract: The continuous improvements on image compression with variational
autoencoders have lead to learned codecs competitive with conventional
approaches in terms of rate-distortion efficiency. Nonetheless, taking the
quantization into account during the training process remains a problem, since
it produces zero derivatives almost everywhere and needs to be replaced with a
differentiable approximation which allows end-to-end optimization. Though there
are different methods for approximating the quantization, none of them model
the quantization noise correctly and thus, result in suboptimal networks.
Hence, we propose an additional finetuning training step: After conventional
end-to-end training, parts of the network are retrained on quantized latents
obtained at the inference stage. For entropy-constraint quantizers like
Trellis-Coded Quantization, the impact of the quantizer is particularly
difficult to approximate by rounding or adding noise as the quantized latents
are interdependently chosen through a trellis search based on both the entropy
model and a distortion measure. We show that retraining on correctly quantized
data consistently yields additional coding gain for both uniform scalar and
especially for entropy-constraint quantization, without increasing inference
complexity. For the Kodak test set, we obtain average savings between 1% and
2%, and for the TecNick test set up to 2.2% in terms of Bj{\o}ntegaard-Delta
bitrate.

Conclusion: 该框架无需增加模型规模或额外训练，为资源受限环境提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) offer promising and efficient alternatives to
large language models (LLMs). However, SLMs' limited capacity restricts their
reasoning capabilities and makes them sensitive to prompt variations. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that enhances SLM
reasoning capabilities through LLM generated blueprints. The blueprints provide
structured, high-level reasoning guides that help SLMs systematically tackle
related problems. Furthermore, our framework integrates a prompt template
search mechanism to mitigate the SLMs' sensitivity to prompt variations. Our
framework demonstrates improved SLM performance across various tasks, including
math (GSM8K), coding (MBPP), and logic reasoning (BBH). Our approach improves
the reasoning capabilities of SLMs without increasing model size or requiring
additional training, offering a lightweight and deployment-friendly solution
for on-device or resource-constrained environments.

Conclusion: VAE-LF为智能电网中的电力负荷管理提供了一种高效的数据补全解决方案。

Abstract: With the development of smart grids, High-Dimensional and Incomplete (HDI)
Power Load Monitoring (PLM) data challenges the performance of Power Load
Forecasting (PLF) models. In this paper, we propose a potential
characterization model VAE-LF based on Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for
efficiently representing and complementing PLM missing data. VAE-LF learns a
low-dimensional latent representation of the data using an Encoder-Decoder
structure by splitting the HDI PLM data into vectors and feeding them
sequentially into the VAE-LF model, and generates the complementary data.
Experiments on the UK-DALE dataset show that VAE-LF outperforms other benchmark
models in both 5% and 10% sparsity test cases, with significantly lower RMSE
and MAE, and especially outperforms on low sparsity ratio data. The method
provides an efficient data-completion solution for electric load management in

Conclusion: R-ICE为动态LLM路由和碳核算等应用提供了实用解决方案，值得进一步研究。

Abstract: While Generative AI stands to be one of the fastest adopted technologies
ever, studies have made evident that the usage of Large Language Models (LLMs)
puts significant burden on energy grids and our environment. It may prove a
hindrance to the Sustainability goals of any organization. A crucial step in
any Sustainability strategy is monitoring or estimating the energy consumption
of various components. While there exist multiple tools for monitoring energy
consumption, there is a dearth of tools/frameworks for estimating the
consumption or carbon emissions. Current drawbacks of both monitoring and
estimation tools include high input data points, intrusive nature, high error
margin, etc. We posit that leveraging emerging LLM benchmarks and related data
points can help overcome aforementioned challenges while balancing accuracy of
the emission estimations. To that extent, we discuss the challenges of current
approaches and present our evolving framework, R-ICE, which estimates prompt
level inference carbon emissions by leveraging existing state-of-the-art(SOTA)
benchmark. This direction provides a more practical and non-intrusive way to
enable emerging use-cases like dynamic LLM routing, carbon accounting, etc. Our
promising validation results suggest that benchmark-based modelling holds great
potential for inference emission estimation and warrants further exploration

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We introduce Random Reward Perturbation (RRP), a novel exploration strategy
for reinforcement learning (RL). Our theoretical analyses demonstrate that
adding zero-mean noise to environmental rewards effectively enhances policy
diversity during training, thereby expanding the range of exploration. RRP is
fully compatible with the action-perturbation-based exploration strategies,
such as $\epsilon$-greedy, stochastic policies, and entropy regularization,
providing additive improvements to exploration effects. It is general,
lightweight, and can be integrated into existing RL algorithms with minimal
implementation effort and negligible computational overhead. RRP establishes a
theoretical connection between reward shaping and noise-driven exploration,
highlighting their complementary potential. Experiments show that RRP
significantly boosts the performance of Proximal Policy Optimization and Soft
Actor-Critic, achieving higher sample efficiency and escaping local optima
across various tasks, under both sparse and dense reward scenarios.

Abstract: We introduce SeerAttention-R, a sparse attention framework specifically

SeerAttention-R, trained on just 0.4B tokens, maintains near-lossless reasoning
accuracy with 4K token budget in AIME benchmark under large sparse attention
block sizes (64/128). Using TileLang, we develop a highly optimized sparse

Conclusion: InFOM通过建模长期依赖和用户意图，显著提升了强化学习预训练的效果，为RL领域的大规模预训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large-scale pre-training has fundamentally changed how machine learning
research is done today: large foundation models are trained once, and then can
be used by anyone in the community (including those without data or compute
resources to train a model from scratch) to adapt and fine-tune to specific
tasks. Applying this same framework to reinforcement learning (RL) is appealing
because it offers compelling avenues for addressing core challenges in RL,
including sample efficiency and robustness. However, there remains a
fundamental challenge to pre-train large models in the context of RL: actions
have long-term dependencies, so training a foundation model that reasons across
time is important. Recent advances in generative AI have provided new tools for
modeling highly complex distributions. In this paper, we build a probabilistic
model to predict which states an agent will visit in the temporally distant
future (i.e., an occupancy measure) using flow matching. As large datasets are
often constructed by many distinct users performing distinct tasks, we include
in our model a latent variable capturing the user intention. This intention
increases the expressivity of our model, and enables adaptation with
generalized policy improvement. We call our proposed method
intention-conditioned flow occupancy models (InFOM). Comparing with alternative
methods for pre-training, our experiments on $36$ state-based and $4$
image-based benchmark tasks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves $1.8
\times$ median improvement in returns and increases success rates by $36\%$.

Motivation: 现有研究较少关注环境状态扰动，而这类扰动在具体场景中很常见，因此需要提升DRL代理的鲁棒性。

Method: 首先提出一种非目标攻击方法作为校准对手，随后提出BAT防御框架，结合监督学习和对抗训练。

Result: 实验表明主流代理在环境状态扰动下脆弱，而BAT能显著提升鲁棒性。

Conclusion: BAT框架在多种情况下能有效增强代理对环境状态扰动的抵抗能力。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks and robustness in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) have
been widely studied in various threat models; however, few consider
environmental state perturbations, which are natural in embodied scenarios. To
improve the robustness of DRL agents, we formulate the problem of environmental
state perturbation, introducing a preliminary non-targeted attack method as a
calibration adversary, and then propose a defense framework, named Boosted
Adversarial Training (BAT), which first tunes the agents via supervised
learning to avoid catastrophic failure and subsequently adversarially trains
the agent with reinforcement learning. Extensive experimental results
substantiate the vulnerability of mainstream agents under environmental state
perturbations and the effectiveness of our proposed attack. The defense results
demonstrate that while existing robust reinforcement learning algorithms may
not be suitable, our BAT framework can significantly enhance the robustness of
agents against environmental state perturbations across various situations.

Conclusion: 数据高效策略在奖励模型优化中潜力巨大，为低资源RLHF应用提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: The ability to train high-performing reward models with few-shot data is
critical for enhancing the efficiency and scalability of Reinforcement Learning
from Human Feedback (RLHF). We propose a data augmentation and expansion
framework that enables generative reward models trained on small datasets to
achieve comparable performance to those trained on large-scale datasets.
Traditional methods to train a generative reward model, such as Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), are constrained by inefficiencies in sample
pairing and limited data diversity. This work introduces preference refinement,
which employs Chain-of-Thought (CoT) sampling to uncover diverse and
high-quality preference relationships. It also incorporates a perplexity-based
scoring mechanism to assign nuanced preference levels and utilizes Multi-level
Direct Preference Optimization (M-DPO) to enable the model to capture
finer-grained preference differences between samples. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method significantly enhances data efficiency and
model performance, enabling reward models trained in a few-shot setting to
achieve results on par with those trained on large-scale datasets. This study
underscores the potential of data-efficient strategies in advancing reward
model optimization, offering a robust solution for low-resource RLHF
applications.

Abstract: Developments in Deep Learning have significantly improved time series
forecasting by enabling more accurate modeling of complex temporal dependencies
inherent in sequential data. The effectiveness of such models is often
demonstrated on limited sets of specific real-world data. Although this allows
for comparative analysis, it still does not demonstrate how specific data
characteristics align with the architectural strengths of individual models.
Our research aims at uncovering clear connections between time series
characteristics and particular models. We introduce a novel dataset generated
using Gaussian Processes, specifically designed to display distinct, known
characteristics for targeted evaluations of model adaptability to them.
Furthermore, we present TimeFlex, a new model that incorporates a modular
architecture tailored to handle diverse temporal dynamics, including trends and
periodic patterns. This model is compared to current state-of-the-art models,
offering a deeper understanding of how models perform under varied time series
conditions.

Method: 通过扩展数据集消除表面模式，评估三种架构在命题逻辑任务中的泛化能力。

Result: 所有模型在训练分布内表现良好，但对未见模式（尤其是否定操作）泛化能力不足。

Conclusion: 标准架构在逻辑运算符的系统表示上存在局限性，需要更强的归纳偏置以支持基于规则的推理。

Abstract: The extent to which neural networks are able to acquire and represent
symbolic rules remains a key topic of research and debate. Much current work
focuses on the impressive capabilities of large language models, as well as
their often ill-understood failures on a wide range of reasoning tasks. In this
paper, in contrast, we investigate the generalization behavior of three key
neural architectures (Transformers, Graph Convolution Networks and LSTMs) in a
controlled task rooted in propositional logic. The task requires models to
generate satisfying assignments for logical formulas, making it a structured
and interpretable setting for studying compositionality. We introduce a
balanced extension of an existing dataset to eliminate superficial patterns and
enable testing on unseen operator combinations. Using this dataset, we evaluate
the ability of the three architectures to generalize beyond the training
distribution. While all models perform well in-distribution, we find that
generalization to unseen patterns, particularly those involving negation,
remains a significant challenge. Transformers fail to apply negation
compositionally, unless structural biases are introduced. Our findings
highlight persistent limitations in the ability of standard architectures to
learn systematic representations of logical operators, suggesting the need for
stronger inductive biases to support robust rule-based reasoning.

*Marton Havasi,Brian Karrer,Itai Gat,Ricky T. Q. Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Edit Flows是一种非自回归模型，通过编辑操作（插入、删除、替换）实现灵活序列生成，优于自回归和掩码模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归模型能生成变长序列，但非自回归模型通常结构僵化。Edit Flows旨在克服这一限制。

Method: 通过连续时间马尔可夫链在序列空间定义编辑操作，并利用辅助变量扩展状态空间以提高训练效率。

Result: 在图像描述生成、文本和代码生成任务中，Edit Flows表现优于自回归和掩码模型。

Conclusion: Edit Flows提供了一种灵活且高效的序列生成方法，为非自回归模型开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Autoregressive generative models naturally generate variable-length
sequences, while non-autoregressive models struggle, often imposing rigid,
token-wise structures. We propose Edit Flows, a non-autoregressive model that
overcomes these limitations by defining a discrete flow over sequences through
edit operations-insertions, deletions, and substitutions. By modeling these
operations within a Continuous-time Markov Chain over the sequence space, Edit
Flows enable flexible, position-relative generation that aligns more closely
with the structure of sequence data. Our training method leverages an expanded
state space with auxiliary variables, making the learning process efficient and
tractable. Empirical results show that Edit Flows outperforms both
autoregressive and mask models on image captioning and significantly
outperforms the mask construction in text and code generation.

*Sizhe Dang,Yangyang Guo,Yanjun Zhao,Haishan Ye,Xiaodong Zheng,Guang Dai,Ivor Tsang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FZOO是一种快速零阶优化器，通过减少收敛所需的前向传递次数，显著提高了优化速度和内存效率，性能优于现有方法MeZO。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型微调中GPU内存瓶颈问题，同时保持优化速度。

Method: FZOO采用批量单侧估计和自适应步长调整，结合CUDA并行处理，减少前向传递次数。

Result: FZOO在11个任务中平均比MeZO准确率提高3%，前向传递次数减少3倍；在RoBERTa-large上准确率提高5.6%，前向传递次数减少18倍。

Conclusion: FZOO实现了单GPU高效微调，为内存高效预训练提供了方向。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) often faces GPU memory bottlenecks:
the backward pass of first-order optimizers like Adam increases memory usage to
more than 10 times the inference level (e.g., 633 GB for OPT-30B). Zeroth-order
(ZO) optimizers avoid this cost by estimating gradients only from forward
passes, yet existing methods like MeZO usually require many more steps to
converge. Can this trade-off between speed and memory in ZO be fundamentally
improved? Normalized-SGD demonstrates strong empirical performance with greater
memory efficiency than Adam. In light of this, we introduce FZOO, a Fast
Zeroth-Order Optimizer toward Adam-Scale Speed. FZOO reduces the total forward
passes needed for convergence by employing batched one-sided estimates that
adapt step sizes based on the standard deviation of batch losses. It also
accelerates per-batch computation through the use of Rademacher random vector
perturbations coupled with CUDA's parallel processing. Extensive experiments on
diverse models, including RoBERTa-large, OPT (350M-66B), Phi-2, and Llama3,
across 11 tasks validate FZOO's effectiveness. On average, FZOO outperforms
MeZO by 3 percent in accuracy while requiring 3 times fewer forward passes. For
RoBERTa-large, FZOO achieves average improvements of 5.6 percent in accuracy
and an 18 times reduction in forward passes compared to MeZO, achieving
convergence speeds comparable to Adam. We also provide theoretical analysis
proving FZOO's formal equivalence to a normalized-SGD update rule and its
convergence guarantees. FZOO integrates smoothly into PEFT techniques, enabling
even larger memory savings. Overall, our results make single-GPU, high-speed,
full-parameter fine-tuning practical and point toward future work on
memory-efficient pre-training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Agentic Neural Network (ANN) 是一个将多智能体协作建模为分层神经网络架构的框架，通过前向和后向两阶段优化策略，显著提升了多智能体系统的准确性和适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多智能体系统依赖静态、手动配置，限制了其灵活性和性能。ANN旨在通过动态任务分解和智能体自优化，克服这些限制。

Method: ANN采用分层神经网络架构，每个智能体作为节点，每层形成专注于特定子任务的团队。通过前向阶段动态分解任务和后向阶段迭代反馈优化协作。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上，ANN在相同配置下超越了领先的多智能体基线，表现出显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: ANN提供了一个可扩展、数据驱动的多智能体系统框架，结合了LLMs的协作能力和神经网络的高效灵活性，未来将开源该框架。

Abstract: Leveraging multiple Large Language Models(LLMs) has proven effective for
addressing complex, high-dimensional tasks, but current approaches often rely
on static, manually engineered multi-agent configurations. To overcome these
constraints, we present the Agentic Neural Network(ANN), a framework that
conceptualizes multi-agent collaboration as a layered neural network
architecture. In this design, each agent operates as a node, and each layer
forms a cooperative "team" focused on a specific subtask. Agentic Neural
Network follows a two-phase optimization strategy: (1) Forward Phase-Drawing
inspiration from neural network forward passes, tasks are dynamically
decomposed into subtasks, and cooperative agent teams with suitable aggregation
methods are constructed layer by layer. (2) Backward Phase-Mirroring
backpropagation, we refine both global and local collaboration through
iterative feedback, allowing agents to self-evolve their roles, prompts, and
coordination. This neuro-symbolic approach enables ANN to create new or
specialized agent teams post-training, delivering notable gains in accuracy and
adaptability. Across four benchmark datasets, ANN surpasses leading multi-agent
baselines under the same configurations, showing consistent performance
improvements. Our findings indicate that ANN provides a scalable, data-driven
framework for multi-agent systems, combining the collaborative capabilities of
LLMs with the efficiency and flexibility of neural network principles. We plan
to open-source the entire framework.

Conclusion: NQES算法为量子多体系统激发态计算提供了可扩展且高效的方法，具有从量子设备基准测试到光异构化的潜在应用。

Abstract: The computation of excited states in strongly interacting quantum many-body
systems is of fundamental importance. Yet, it is notoriously challenging due to
the exponential scaling of the Hilbert space dimension with the system size.
Here, we introduce a neural network-based algorithm that can simultaneously
output multiple low-lying excited states of a quantum many-body spin system in
an accurate and efficient fashion. This algorithm, dubbed the neural quantum
excited-state (NQES) algorithm, requires no explicit orthogonalization of the
states and is generally applicable to higher dimensions. We demonstrate,
through concrete examples including the Haldane-Shastry model with all-to-all
interactions, that the NQES algorithm is capable of efficiently computing
multiple excited states and their related observable expectations. In addition,
we apply the NQES algorithm to two classes of long-range interacting
trapped-ion systems in a two-dimensional Wigner crystal. For non-decaying
all-to-all interactions with alternating signs, our computed low-lying excited
states bear spatial correlation patterns similar to those of the ground states,
which closely match recent experimental observations that the
quasi-adiabatically prepared state accurately reproduces analytical
ground-state correlations. For a system of up to 300 ions with power-law
decaying antiferromagnetic interactions, we successfully uncover its gap
scaling and correlation features. Our results establish a scalable and
efficient algorithm for computing excited states of interacting quantum
many-body systems, which holds potential applications ranging from benchmarking
quantum devices to photoisomerization.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) for Natural Language Processing
(NLP) is the predominant AI technology to date. An important perspective for
Quantum Computing (QC) is the question whether QC has the potential to reduce
the vast resource requirements for training and operating GenAI models. While
large-scale generative NLP tasks are currently out of reach for practical
quantum computers, the generation of short semantic structures such as
passwords is not. Generating passwords that mimic real user behavior has many
applications, for example to test an authentication system against realistic
threat models. Classical password generation via deep learning have recently
been investigated with significant progress in their ability to generate novel,
realistic password candidates. In the present work we investigate the utility
of adiabatic quantum computers for this task. More precisely, we study
different encodings of token strings and propose novel approaches based on the
Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) and the Unit-Disk Maximum
Independent Set (UD-MIS) problems. Our approach allows us to estimate the token
distribution from data and adiabatically prepare a quantum state from which we
eventually sample the generated passwords via measurements. Our results show
that relatively small samples of 128 passwords, generated on the QuEra Aquila
256-qubit neutral atom quantum computer, contain human-like passwords such as
"Tunas200992" or "teedem28iglove".

Conclusion: 多模态基础模型在蛋白质生物学中的结构-功能理解方面具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: This paper aims to retrieve proteins with similar structures and semantics
from large-scale protein dataset, facilitating the functional interpretation of
protein structures derived by structural determination methods like
cryo-Electron Microscopy (cryo-EM). Motivated by the recent progress of
vision-language models (VLMs), we propose a CLIP-style framework for aligning
3D protein structures with functional annotations using contrastive learning.
For model training, we propose a large-scale dataset of approximately 200,000
protein-caption pairs with rich functional descriptors. We evaluate our model
in both in-domain and more challenging cross-database retrieval on Protein Data
Bank (PDB) and Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB) dataset, respectively. In
both cases, our approach demonstrates promising zero-shot retrieval
performance, highlighting the potential of multimodal foundation models for
structure-function understanding in protein biology.

MOSAIC-F, an acronym for a data-driven Framework that integrates Multimodal
Learning Analytics (MMLA), Observations, Sensors, Artificial Intelligence (AI),
and Collaborative assessments for generating personalized feedback on student
learning activities. This framework consists of four key steps. First, peers
and professors' assessments are conducted through standardized rubrics (that
include both quantitative and qualitative evaluations). Second, multimodal data
are collected during learning activities, including video recordings, audio
capture, gaze tracking, physiological signals (heart rate, motion data), and
behavioral interactions. Third, personalized feedback is generated using AI,
synthesizing human-based evaluations and data-based multimodal insights such as
posture, speech patterns, stress levels, and cognitive load, among others.
Finally, students review their own performance through video recordings and
engage in self-assessment and feedback visualization, comparing their own
evaluations with peers and professors' assessments, class averages, and
AI-generated recommendations. By combining human-based and data-based
evaluation techniques, this framework enables more accurate, personalized and

Abstract: Fast and accurate simulation of soft tissue deformation is a critical factor

physics-informed neural simulator that approximates soft tissue deformations in
a realistic and real-time manner. Our framework integrates Kelvinlet-based
priors into neural simulators, making it the first approach to leverage
Kelvinlets for residual learning and regularization in data-driven soft tissue

of both linear and nonlinear soft tissue responses, our method improves neural
network predictions across diverse architectures, enhancing accuracy and
physical consistency while maintaining low latency for real-time performance.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by performing accurate

Abstract: A new extended version of the altiro3D C++ Library -- initially developed to
get glass-free holographic displays starting from 2D images -- is here
introduced aiming to deal with 3D video streams from either 2D webcam images or
flat video files. These streams are processed in real-time to synthesize
light-fields (in Native format) and feed realistic 3D experiences. The core
function needed to recreate multiviews consists on the use of MiDaS
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which allows to extract a depth map from a
single 2D image. Artificial Intelligence (AI) computing techniques are applied
to improve the overall performance of the extended altiro3D Library. Thus,
altiro3D can now treat standard images, video streams or screen portions of a
Desktop where other apps may be also running (like web browsers, video chats,
etc) and render them into 3D. To achieve the latter, a screen region need to be
selected in order to feed the output directly into a light-field 3D device such
as Looking Glass (LG) Portrait. In order to simplify the acquisition of a
Desktop screen area by the user, a multi-platform Graphical User Interface has
been also implemented. Sources available at:

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，该方法显著优于现有方法，能够跨类别重建关节物体。

Conclusion: 该方法为关节物体的实际、可扩展和通用化重建提供了新思路。

Abstract: Articulated objects are prevalent in daily life. Understanding their
kinematic structure and reconstructing them have numerous applications in
embodied AI and robotics. However, current methods require carefully captured
data for training or inference, preventing practical, scalable, and
generalizable reconstruction of articulated objects. We focus on reconstruction
of an articulated object from a casually captured RGBD video shot with a
hand-held camera. A casually captured video of an interaction with an
articulated object is easy to acquire at scale using smartphones. However, this
setting is quite challenging, as the object and camera move simultaneously and
there are significant occlusions as the person interacts with the object. To
tackle these challenges, we introduce a coarse-to-fine framework that infers
joint parameters and segments movable parts of the object from a dynamic RGBD
video. To evaluate our method under this new setting, we build a 20$\times$
larger synthetic dataset of 784 videos containing 284 objects across 11
categories. We compare our approach with existing methods that also take video
as input. Experiments show that our method can reconstruct synthetic and real
articulated objects across different categories from dynamic RGBD videos,
outperforming existing methods significantly.

Conclusion: 该方法为几何对齐且物理逼真的全息场景表示迈出了第一步。

Abstract: Modeling the full properties of light, including both amplitude and phase, in
3D representations is crucial for advancing physically plausible rendering,
particularly in holographic displays. To support these features, we propose a
novel representation that optimizes 3D scenes without relying on
intensity-based intermediaries. We reformulate 3D Gaussian splatting with
complex-valued Gaussian primitives, expanding support for rendering with light
waves. By leveraging RGBD multi-view images, our method directly optimizes
complex-valued Gaussians as a 3D holographic scene representation. This
eliminates the need for computationally expensive hologram re-optimization.
Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves 30x-10,000x speed
improvements while maintaining on-par image quality, representing a first step
towards geometrically aligned, physically plausible holographic scene
representations.

Abstract: Selection is the first step in many image editing processes, enabling faster

work, we present a method for material selection in images, robust to lighting
and reflectance variations, which can be used for downstream editing tasks. We
rely on vision transformer (ViT) models and leverage their features for
selection, proposing a multi-resolution processing strategy that yields finer
and more stable selection results than prior methods. Furthermore, we enable
selection at two levels: texture and subtexture, leveraging a new two-level
material selection (DuMaS) dataset which includes dense annotations for over
800,000 synthetic images, both on the texture and subtexture levels.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在程序最坏情况执行中的符号约束分析能力，提出了一种新任务并通过符号推理指导的微调方法提升LLMs性能。实验表明，3B规模的模型WARP-1.0-3B优于基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在复杂符号推理任务中的潜力，尤其是程序最坏情况执行的符号约束分析，以连接LLMs与符号推理方法。

Method: 定义最坏情况符号约束分析任务，通过SMT约束求解和专门设计的符号约束数据集进行微调，结合强化学习方法。

Result: WARP-1.0-3B模型在性能上超越规模匹配甚至更大的基线模型，展示了LLMs在符号推理中的潜力。

Conclusion: LLMs能够进行更深层次的符号推理，支持神经网络学习与形式化方法的更紧密集成。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been successfully applied to a variety of
coding tasks, including code generation, completion, and repair. However, more
complex symbolic reasoning tasks remain largely unexplored by LLMs. This paper
investigates the capacity of LLMs to reason about worst-case executions in
programs through symbolic constraints analysis, aiming to connect LLMs and
symbolic reasoning approaches. Specifically, we define and address the problem
of worst-case symbolic constraints analysis as a measure to assess the
comprehension of LLMs. We evaluate the performance of existing LLMs on this
novel task and further improve their capabilities through symbolic
reasoning-guided fine-tuning, grounded in SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories)
constraint solving and supported by a specially designed dataset of symbolic
constraints. Experimental results show that our solver-aligned model,
WARP-1.0-3B, consistently surpasses size-matched and even much larger
baselines, demonstrating that a 3B LLM can recover the very constraints that
pin down an algorithm's worst-case behaviour through reinforcement learning
methods. These findings suggest that LLMs are capable of engaging in deeper
symbolic reasoning, supporting a closer integration between neural
network-based learning and formal methods for rigorous program analysis.

TL;DR: Repeton是一个开源框架，利用LLMs通过结构化补丁测试流程实现精确的代码操作，性能优于RAG方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在复杂软件工程任务中精度低且可解释性差，需要改进。

Method: 采用分步补丁测试流程，结合轻量级启发式工具，避免依赖嵌入检索系统。

Result: 在SWE-bench Lite基准测试中表现优于RAG方法，补丁有效性和可解释性均佳。

Conclusion: Repeton通过模块化、可验证的任务分解，为可扩展且透明的自主调试提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in code
generation and comprehension, yet their application to complex software
engineering tasks often suffers from low precision and limited
interpretability. We present Repeton, a fully open-source framework that
leverages LLMs for precise and automated code manipulation in real-world Git
repositories. Rather than generating holistic fixes, Repeton operates through a
structured patch-and-test pipeline: it iteratively diagnoses issues, proposes
code changes, and validates each patch through automated testing. This stepwise
process is guided by lightweight heuristics and development tools, avoiding
reliance on embedding-based retrieval systems. Evaluated on the SWE-bench Lite
benchmark, our method shows good performance compared to RAG-based methods in
both patch validity and interpretability. By decomposing software engineering
tasks into modular, verifiable stages, Repeton provides a practical path toward
scalable and transparent autonomous debugging.

Abstract: With the advent of large language models (LLMs), software engineering agents
(SWE agents) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for automating a range of
software tasks -- from code generation and repair to test case synthesis. These
agents operate autonomously by interpreting user input and responding to
environmental feedback. While various agent architectures have demonstrated
strong empirical performance, the internal decision-making worfklows that drive
their behavior remain poorly understood. Deeper insight into these workflows
hold promise for improving both agent reliability and efficiency. In this work,
we present the first systematic study of SWE agent behavior through the lens of
execution traces. Our contributions are as follows: (1) we propose the first
taxonomy of decision-making pathways across five representative agents; (2)
using this taxonomy, we identify three core components essential to agent
success -- bug localization, patch generation, and reproduction test generation
-- and study each in depth; (3) we study the impact of test generation on
successful patch production; and analyze strategies that can lead to successful
test generation; (4) we further conduct the first large-scale code clone
analysis comparing agent-generated and developer-written patches and provide a
qualitative study revealing structural and stylistic differences in patch
content. Together, these findings offer novel insights into agent design and
open avenues for building agents that are both more effective and more aligned
with human development practices.

Conclusion: 研究强调需深入调查并制定有效策略，以提升AI生成代码的可持续性。

Abstract: Software sustainability is emerging as a primary concern, aiming to optimize
resource utilization, minimize environmental impact, and promote a greener,
more resilient digital ecosystem. The sustainability or "greenness" of software
is typically determined by the adoption of sustainable coding practices. With a
maturing ecosystem around generative AI, many software developers now rely on
these tools to generate code using natural language prompts. Despite their
potential advantages, there is a significant lack of studies on the
sustainability aspects of AI-generated code. Specifically, how environmentally
friendly is the AI-generated code based upon its adoption of sustainable coding
practices? In this paper, we present the results of an early investigation into
the sustainability aspects of AI-generated code across three popular generative
AI tools - ChatGPT, BARD, and Copilot. The results highlight the default
non-green behavior of tools for generating code, across multiple rules and
scenarios. It underscores the need for further in-depth investigations and
effective remediation strategies.

Motivation: 工业中的MR流程常偏离标准审查过程，导致分析和ML模型结果偏差。

Method: 识别了七种偏差类别，并提出了一种few-shot学习检测方法。

Result: 排除偏差后，ML模型在53.33%的情况下性能提升（最高2.25倍），特征重要性显著变化。

Conclusion: 研究为优化审查流程和提升ML模型可靠性提供了实用工具和证据。

Abstract: Code review is a key practice in software engineering, ensuring quality and
collaboration. However, industrial Merge Request (MR) workflows often deviate
from standardized review processes, with many MRs serving non-review purposes
(e.g., drafts, rebases, or dependency updates). We term these cases deviations
and hypothesize that ignoring them biases analytics and undermines ML models
for review analysis.
  We identify seven deviation categories, occurring in 37.02% of MRs, and
propose a few-shot learning detection method (91% accuracy). By excluding
deviations, ML models predicting review completion time improve performance in
53.33% of cases (up to 2.25x) and exhibit significant shifts in feature
importance (47% overall, 60% top-*k*).
  Our contributions include: (1) a taxonomy of MR deviations, (2) an AI-driven
detection approach, and (3) empirical evidence of their impact on ML-based
review analytics. This work aids practitioners in optimizing review efforts and
ensuring reliable insights.

Motivation: 提高早期药物发现中Caco-2通透性预测的准确性和效率。

Method: 系统评估八种分子特征表示类型（包括2D/3D描述符、结构指纹和深度学习嵌入）结合AutoML技术，使用两个数据集（TDC基准和OCHEM数据）进行模型性能比较。

Result: PaDEL、Mordred和RDKit描述符表现最佳，AutoML模型CaliciBoost的MAE性能最优；3D描述符比2D特征降低15.73%的MAE。

Conclusion: AutoML方法在ADMET建模中有效，为数据有限的任务提供了实用的特征选择指导。

Abstract: Caco-2 permeability serves as a critical in vitro indicator for predicting
the oral absorption of drug candidates during early-stage drug discovery. To
enhance the accuracy and efficiency of computational predictions, we
systematically investigated the impact of eight molecular feature
representation types including 2D/3D descriptors, structural fingerprints, and
deep learning-based embeddings combined with automated machine learning
techniques to predict Caco-2 permeability. Using two datasets of differing
scale and diversity (TDC benchmark and curated OCHEM data), we assessed model
performance across representations and identified PaDEL, Mordred, and RDKit
descriptors as particularly effective for Caco-2 prediction. Notably, the
AutoML-based model CaliciBoost achieved the best MAE performance. Furthermore,
for both PaDEL and Mordred representations, the incorporation of 3D descriptors
resulted in a 15.73% reduction in MAE compared to using 2D features alone, as
confirmed by feature importance analysis. These findings highlight the
effectiveness of AutoML approaches in ADMET modeling and offer practical
guidance for feature selection in data-limited prediction tasks.

Conclusion: KP-PINNs为提升PINNs求解器的稳定性和准确性提供了新方向。

Abstract: Differential equations are involved in modeling many engineering problems.
Many efforts have been devoted to solving differential equations. Due to the
flexibility of neural networks, Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have
recently been proposed to solve complex differential equations and have
demonstrated superior performance in many applications. While the L2 loss
function is usually a default choice in PINNs, it has been shown that the
corresponding numerical solution is incorrect and unstable for some complex
equations. In this work, we propose a new PINNs framework named Kernel Packet
accelerated PINNs (KP-PINNs), which gives a new expression of the loss function
using the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) norm and uses the Kernel
Packet (KP) method to accelerate the computation. Theoretical results show that
KP-PINNs can be stable across various differential equations. Numerical
experiments illustrate that KP-PINNs can solve differential equations
effectively and efficiently. This framework provides a promising direction for
improving the stability and accuracy of PINNs-based solvers in scientific
computing.

Conclusion: MasHost是首个基于强化学习的自主MAS图构建框架，为复杂任务提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-driven Multi-agent systems (Mas) have recently
emerged as a powerful paradigm for tackling complex real-world tasks. However,
existing Mas construction methods typically rely on manually crafted
interaction mechanisms or heuristic rules, introducing human biases and
constraining the autonomous ability. Even with recent advances in adaptive Mas
construction, existing systems largely remain within the paradigm of
semi-autonomous patterns. In this work, we propose MasHost, a Reinforcement
Learning (RL)-based framework for autonomous and query-adaptive Mas design. By
formulating Mas construction as a graph search problem, our proposed MasHost
jointly samples agent roles and their interactions through a unified
probabilistic sampling mechanism. Beyond the accuracy and efficiency objectives
pursued in prior works, we introduce component rationality as an additional and
novel design principle in Mas. To achieve this multi-objective optimization, we
propose Hierarchical Relative Policy Optimization (HRPO), a novel RL strategy
that collaboratively integrates group-relative advantages and action-wise
rewards. To our knowledge, our proposed MasHost is the first RL-driven
framework for autonomous Mas graph construction. Extensive experiments on six
benchmarks demonstrate that MasHost consistently outperforms most competitive
baselines, validating its effectiveness, efficiency, and structure rationality.

TL;DR: TelePiT是一种新型深度学习架构，通过整合多尺度物理和遥相关意识，显著提升了全球次季节到季节（S2S）预测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: S2S预测由于大气系统的混沌动力学和多尺度复杂相互作用而具有挑战性，现有方法未能明确建模关键的物理过程和遥相关。

Method: TelePiT包含三个关键组件：球谐嵌入、多尺度物理信息神经ODE和遥相关感知Transformer，分别用于编码全球大气变量、捕捉多尺度物理过程和建模遥相关模式。

Result: 实验表明，TelePiT显著优于现有数据驱动方法和数值天气预报系统，例如2米温度RMSE降低了57.7%。

Conclusion: TelePiT通过整合物理过程和遥相关模式，为S2S预测提供了更准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) forecasting, which predicts climate conditions
from several weeks to months in advance, presents significant challenges due to
the chaotic dynamics of atmospheric systems and complex interactions across
multiple scales. Current approaches often fail to explicitly model underlying
physical processes and teleconnections that are crucial at S2S timescales. We
introduce TelePiT, a novel deep learning architecture that enhances global S2S
forecasting through integrated multi-scale physics and teleconnection
awareness. Our approach consists of three key components: (1) Spherical
Harmonic Embedding, which accurately encodes global atmospheric variables onto
spherical geometry; (2) Multi-Scale Physics-Informed Neural ODE, which
explicitly captures atmospheric physical processes across multiple learnable
frequency bands; (3) Teleconnection-Aware Transformer, which models critical
global climate interactions through tactfully injecting teleconnection patterns
into the self-attention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TelePiT
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art data-driven baselines and
operational numerical weather prediction systems, with remarkable improvements
for atmospheric variables including a 57.7% reduction in RMSE for 2-meter
temperature compared to previous best models.

Result: WWAggr方法在性能上优于标准的预测聚合技术（如平均法），并有效解决了决策阈值选择的难题。

Conclusion: WWAggr为高维变化点检测提供了一种更稳健的解决方案，显著提升了检测质量。

Abstract: Change Point Detection (CPD) aims to identify moments of abrupt distribution
shifts in data streams. Real-world high-dimensional CPD remains challenging due
to data pattern complexity and violation of common assumptions. Resorting to
standalone deep neural networks, the current state-of-the-art detectors have
yet to achieve perfect quality. Concurrently, ensembling provides more robust
solutions, boosting the performance. In this paper, we investigate ensembles of
deep change point detectors and realize that standard prediction aggregation
techniques, e.g., averaging, are suboptimal and fail to account for problem
peculiarities. Alternatively, we introduce WWAggr -- a novel task-specific
method of ensemble aggregation based on the Wasserstein distance. Our procedure
is versatile, working effectively with various ensembles of deep CPD models.
Moreover, unlike existing solutions, we practically lift a long-standing
problem of the decision threshold selection for CPD.

Conclusion: DCIDA为分布式电路逆设计提供了一种高效且适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: The goal of inverse design in distributed circuits is to generate
near-optimal designs that meet a desirable transfer function specification.
Existing design exploration methods use some combination of strategies
involving artificial grids, differentiable evaluation procedures, and specific
template topologies. However, real-world design practices often require
non-differentiable evaluation procedures, varying topologies, and
near-continuous placement spaces. In this paper, we propose DCIDA, a design
exploration framework that learns a near-optimal design sampling policy for a
target transfer function. DCIDA decides all design factors in a compound
single-step action by sampling from a set of jointly-trained conditional
distributions generated by the policy. Utilizing an injective interdependent
``map", DCIDA transforms raw sampled design ``actions" into uniquely equivalent
physical representations, enabling the framework to learn the conditional
dependencies among joint ``raw'' design decisions. Our experiments demonstrate
DCIDA's Transformer-based policy network achieves significant reductions in
design error compared to state-of-the-art approaches, with significantly better
fit in cases involving more complex transfer functions.

Conclusion: SPBA通过多样化触发器和MGDA算法，显著提升了后门攻击的效果和效率。

Abstract: Deep speech classification tasks, including keyword spotting and speaker
verification, are vital in speech-based human-computer interaction. Recently,
the security of these technologies has been revealed to be susceptible to
backdoor attacks. Specifically, attackers use noisy disruption triggers and
speech element triggers to produce poisoned speech samples that train models to
become vulnerable. However, these methods typically create only a limited
number of backdoors due to the inherent constraints of the trigger function. In
this paper, we propose that speech backdoor attacks can strategically focus on
speech elements such as timbre and emotion, leveraging the Speech Large
Language Model (SLLM) to generate diverse triggers. Increasing the number of
triggers may disproportionately elevate the poisoning rate, resulting in higher
attack costs and a lower success rate per trigger. We introduce the Multiple
Gradient Descent Algorithm (MGDA) as a mitigation strategy to address this
challenge. The proposed attack is called the Speech Prompt Backdoor Attack
(SPBA). Building on this foundation, we conducted attack experiments on two
speech classification tasks, demonstrating that SPBA shows significant trigger
effectiveness and achieves exceptional performance in attack metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要为每种源-目标波形对设计单独模型，导致临床使用不便。MD-ViSCo旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 使用浅层1D U-Net结合Swin Transformer和AdaIN，捕获不同波形风格。

Result: 在两个数据集上，平均MAE降低8.8%，PC提高4.9%，生成的ABP波形满足AAMI和BHS标准。

Conclusion: MD-ViSCo提供了一个统一的框架，可处理多种生命体征波形，简化了医疗监测。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress of deep-learning methods generating a target
vital sign waveform from a source vital sign waveform, most existing models are
designed exclusively for a specific source-to-target pair. This requires
distinct model architectures, optimization procedures, and pre-processing
pipelines, resulting in multiple models that hinder usability in clinical
settings. To address this limitation, we propose the Multi-Directional
Vital-Sign Converter (MD-ViSCo), a unified framework capable of generating any
target waveform such as electrocardiogram (ECG), photoplethysmogram (PPG), or
arterial blood pressure (ABP) from any single input waveform with a single
model. MD-ViSCo employs a shallow 1-Dimensional U-Net integrated with a Swin
Transformer that leverages Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) to capture
distinct waveform styles. To evaluate the efficacy of MD-ViSCo, we conduct
multi-directional waveform generation on two publicly available datasets. Our
framework surpasses state-of-the-art baselines (NabNet & PPG2ABP) on average
across all waveform types, lowering Mean absolute error (MAE) by 8.8% and
improving Pearson correlation (PC) by 4.9% over two datasets. In addition, the
generated ABP waveforms satisfy the Association for the Advancement of Medical
Instrumentation (AAMI) criterion and achieve Grade B on the British
Hypertension Society (BHS) standard, outperforming all baselines. By
eliminating the need for developing a distinct model for each task, we believe
that this work offers a unified framework that can deal with any kind of vital
sign waveforms with a single model in healthcare monitoring.

Motivation: 现有大型音频语言模型依赖文本输出，限制了直接生成自然语音的能力，阻碍了流畅的音频交互。

Method: 模型采用双码本音频标记器提取特征，结合1300亿参数LLM和神经声码器，通过后训练优化语义连贯性和性能。

Result: 在StepEval-Audio-360基准测试中，Step-Audio-AQAA在语音控制等关键领域表现优异，超越现有技术。

Conclusion: 该研究为端到端音频语言模型提供了有效解决方案，并强调了基于标记的声码器在提升性能中的关键作用。

Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) have significantly advanced intelligent
human-computer interaction, yet their reliance on text-based outputs limits
their ability to generate natural speech responses directly, hindering seamless
audio interactions. To address this, we introduce Step-Audio-AQAA, a fully
end-to-end LALM designed for Audio Query-Audio Answer (AQAA) tasks. The model
integrates a dual-codebook audio tokenizer for linguistic and semantic feature
extraction, a 130-billion-parameter backbone LLM and a neural vocoder for
high-fidelity speech synthesis. Our post-training approach employs interleaved
token-output of text and audio to enhance semantic coherence and combines
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with model merge to improve performance.
Evaluations on the StepEval-Audio-360 benchmark demonstrate that
Step-Audio-AQAA excels especially in speech control, outperforming the
state-of-art LALMs in key areas. This work contributes a promising solution for
end-to-end LALMs and highlights the critical role of token-based vocoder in
enhancing overall performance for AQAA tasks.

TL;DR: ACORN框架通过声音教授LLMs物理意识，利用物理模拟器生成训练数据，构建AQA-PHY数据集，并连接音频编码器与LLMs，在模拟和现实任务中取得合理结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在文本和多模态处理中表现出色，但缺乏对现实世界物理现象的理解。ACORN旨在通过声音填补这一空白。

Method: ACORN引入基于物理的模拟器，结合真实声音源和可控物理通道生成训练数据，构建AQA-PHY数据集，并提出处理幅度和相位信息的音频编码器。

Result: 在模拟和现实任务（如视线检测、多普勒效应估计和到达方向估计）中取得合理结果。

Conclusion: ACORN为LLMs理解物理世界铺平了道路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in text and
multimodal processing, yet they fundamentally lack physical
awareness--understanding of real-world physical phenomena. In this work, we
present ACORN, a framework that teaches LLMs physical awareness through sound,
focusing on fundamental physical phenomena like the Doppler effect, multipath
effect, and spatial relationships. To overcome data scarcity, ACORN introduce a
physics-based simulator combining real-world sound sources with controlled
physical channels to generate diverse training data. Using this simulator, we
build AQA-PHY, a comprehensive Audio Question-Answer dataset, and propose an
audio encoder that processes both magnitude and phase information. By
connecting our audio encoder to state-of-the-art LLMs, we demonstrate
reasonable results in both simulated and real-world tasks, such as
line-of-sight detection, Doppler effect estimation, and Direction-of-Arrival
estimation, paving the way for enabling LLMs to understand physical world.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到音乐生成模型在训练数据、建模范式和架构选择上差异显著，难以公平评估性能。本文专注于建模范式的影响。

Method: 使用相同的数据集、训练配置和类似的主干架构，对比自回归解码和条件流匹配两种范式。

Result: 评估了生成质量、推理配置的鲁棒性、可扩展性、条件遵循能力和音频修复能力，揭示了各自的优势与局限。

Conclusion: 研究为未来文本到音乐生成系统的设计和训练提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-music generation has enabled models to synthesize
high-quality musical segments, full compositions, and even respond to
fine-grained control signals, e.g. chord progressions. State-of-the-art (SOTA)
systems differ significantly across many dimensions, such as training datasets,
modeling paradigms, and architectural choices. This diversity complicates
efforts to evaluate models fairly and pinpoint which design choices most
influence performance. While factors like data and architecture are important,
in this study we focus exclusively on the modeling paradigm. We conduct a
systematic empirical analysis to isolate its effects, offering insights into
associated trade-offs and emergent behaviors that can guide future
text-to-music generation systems. Specifically, we compare the two arguably
most common modeling paradigms: Auto-Regressive decoding and Conditional
Flow-Matching. We conduct a controlled comparison by training all models from
scratch using identical datasets, training configurations, and similar backbone
architectures. Performance is evaluated across multiple axes, including
generation quality, robustness to inference configurations, scalability,
adherence to both textual and temporally aligned conditioning, and editing
capabilities in the form of audio inpainting. This comparative study sheds
light on distinct strengths and limitations of each paradigm, providing
actionable insights that can inform future architectural and training decisions
in the evolving landscape of text-to-music generation. Audio sampled examples

TL;DR: 论文研究了生成式AI（特别是LLMs）在网络安全访问控制系统中的应用，重点关注LLM生成密码策略的准确性和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在自然语言处理中表现出色，但其输出的不一致性和不可预测性在安全关键领域（如访问控制）中带来挑战。

Method: 采用两种方法：1）仅用自然语言提示生成配置；2）提供官方文档作为基准，评估生成配置的准确性。

Result: 发现当前LLMs在生成配置时存在显著挑战，尤其在一致性和准确性方面。

Conclusion: 研究为优化LLMs在访问控制系统中的应用提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Generative AI technologies, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), are
rapidly being adopted across industry, academia, and government sectors, owing
to their remarkable capabilities in natural language processing. However,
despite their strengths, the inconsistency and unpredictability of LLM outputs
present substantial challenges, especially in security-critical domains such as
access control. One critical issue that emerges prominently is the consistency
of LLM-generated responses, which is paramount for ensuring secure and reliable
operations.
  In this paper, we study the application of LLMs within the context of
Cybersecurity Access Control Systems. Specifically, we investigate the
consistency and accuracy of LLM-generated password policies, translating
natural language prompts into executable pwquality.conf configuration files.
Our experimental methodology adopts two distinct approaches: firstly, we
utilize pre-trained LLMs to generate configuration files purely from natural
language prompts without additional guidance. Secondly, we provide these models
with official pwquality.conf documentation to serve as an informative baseline.
We systematically assess the soundness, accuracy, and consistency of these
AI-generated configurations. Our findings underscore significant challenges in
the current generation of LLMs and contribute valuable insights into refining
the deployment of LLMs in Access Control Systems.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: GradEscape是一种基于梯度的攻击方法，用于对抗AI生成文本检测器，通过加权嵌入和模型参数更新实现高效攻击，并在实验中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI生成文本检测器的不可微分计算问题，并适应不同语言模型架构的检测器。

Method: 引入加权嵌入和暖启动方法，结合分词器推断和模型提取技术。

Result: 在多个数据集和语言模型上表现优异，成功攻击商业检测器，并揭示训练数据中的表达风格差异是主要漏洞。

Conclusion: GradEscape是一种高效攻击工具，同时提出了防御策略，并开源以促进更鲁棒的检测器开发。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce GradEscape, the first gradient-based evader
designed to attack AI-generated text (AIGT) detectors. GradEscape overcomes the
undifferentiable computation problem, caused by the discrete nature of text, by
introducing a novel approach to construct weighted embeddings for the detector
input. It then updates the evader model parameters using feedback from victim
detectors, achieving high attack success with minimal text modification. To
address the issue of tokenizer mismatch between the evader and the detector, we
introduce a warm-started evader method, enabling GradEscape to adapt to
detectors across any language model architecture. Moreover, we employ novel
tokenizer inference and model extraction techniques, facilitating effective
evasion even in query-only access.
  We evaluate GradEscape on four datasets and three widely-used language
models, benchmarking it against four state-of-the-art AIGT evaders.
Experimental results demonstrate that GradEscape outperforms existing evaders
in various scenarios, including with an 11B paraphrase model, while utilizing
only 139M parameters. We have successfully applied GradEscape to two real-world
commercial AIGT detectors. Our analysis reveals that the primary vulnerability
stems from disparity in text expression styles within the training data. We
also propose a potential defense strategy to mitigate the threat of AIGT
evaders. We open-source our GradEscape for developing more robust AIGT
detectors.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: ReAgent是一种针对大型语言模型（LLM）代理后门攻击的新型防御方法，通过检测用户指令、代理规划和执行之间的一致性来识别潜在后门。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理在训练和微调过程中面临后门攻击的安全风险，可能导致恶意操作。

Method: ReAgent采用两级检测方法：执行层面验证代理思维与行动的一致性；规划层面通过代理重建指令并与用户指令对比。

Result: ReAgent显著降低了攻击成功率（如数据库操作任务中减少90%），优于现有防御方法。

Conclusion: 研究表明，利用被攻击代理自身能力可有效缓解后门风险。

Abstract: Despite their growing adoption across domains, large language model
(LLM)-powered agents face significant security risks from backdoor attacks
during training and fine-tuning. These compromised agents can subsequently be
manipulated to execute malicious operations when presented with specific
triggers in their inputs or environments. To address this pressing risk, we
present ReAgent, a novel defense against a range of backdoor attacks on
LLM-based agents. Intuitively, backdoor attacks often result in inconsistencies
among the user's instruction, the agent's planning, and its execution. Drawing
on this insight, ReAgent employs a two-level approach to detect potential
backdoors. At the execution level, ReAgent verifies consistency between the
agent's thoughts and actions; at the planning level, ReAgent leverages the
agent's capability to reconstruct the instruction based on its thought
trajectory, checking for consistency between the reconstructed instruction and
the user's instruction. Extensive evaluation demonstrates ReAgent's
effectiveness against various backdoor attacks across tasks. For instance,
ReAgent reduces the attack success rate by up to 90\% in database operation
tasks, outperforming existing defenses by large margins. This work reveals the
potential of utilizing compromised agents themselves to mitigate backdoor
risks.

*Tingzhi Li,Xuefeng Liu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: WGLE是一种新型的黑盒水印方法，用于GNN模型所有权验证，通过多比特字符串嵌入所有权信息，避免使用后门。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有指纹和黑盒水印方法存在计算成本高、所有权冲突或后门攻击风险，且无法传递额外信息。

Method: 基于层间距离差异（LDDE），通过预定义边上的正负LDDE值嵌入水印，不影响主任务。

Result: 在六个数据集和六种GNN架构上验证，WGLE达到100%所有权验证准确率，平均保真度下降0.85%。

Conclusion: WGLE是一种高效、安全且低开销的GNN所有权验证方法。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are increasingly deployed in graph-related
applications, making ownership verification critical to protect their
intellectual property against model theft. Fingerprinting and black-box
watermarking are two main methods. However, the former relies on determining
model similarity, which is computationally expensive and prone to ownership
collisions after model post-processing such as model pruning or fine-tuning.
The latter embeds backdoors, exposing watermarked models to the risk of
backdoor attacks. Moreover, both methods enable ownership verification but do
not convey additional information. As a result, each distributed model requires
a unique trigger graph, and all trigger graphs must be used to query the
suspect model during verification. Multiple queries increase the financial cost
and the risk of detection.
  To address these challenges, this paper proposes WGLE, a novel black-box
watermarking paradigm for GNNs that enables embedding the multi-bit string as
the ownership information without using backdoors. WGLE builds on a key insight
we term Layer-wise Distance Difference on an Edge (LDDE), which quantifies the
difference between the feature distance and the prediction distance of two
connected nodes. By predefining positive or negative LDDE values for multiple
selected edges, WGLE embeds the watermark encoding the intended information
without introducing incorrect mappings that compromise the primary task. WGLE
is evaluated on six public datasets and six mainstream GNN architectures along
with state-of-the-art methods. The results show that WGLE achieves 100%
ownership verification accuracy, an average fidelity degradation of 0.85%,
comparable robustness against potential attacks, and low embedding overhead.
The code is available in the repository.

Motivation: 工科生在学术生涯初期往往缺乏对AI及其社会影响的基础知识，因此设计了这门课程以填补这一空白。

Method: 课程分为三个模块（行星、社会影响、职场），由工程和人文学科教师共同授课，结合技术教学与社会讨论。

Result: 学生理解AI挑战的能力显著提升，包括对AI环境影响的认识增加，以及对AI公平性问题的解决方案更高效。

Conclusion: 该课程的跨学科设计和教学方法有效提升了大一工科生对AI及其社会影响的理解。

Abstract: This work presents a novel course titled The World of AI designed for
first-year undergraduate engineering students with little to no prior exposure
to AI. The central problem addressed by this course is that engineering
students often lack foundational knowledge of AI and its broader societal
implications at the outset of their academic journeys. We believe the way to
address this gap is to design and deliver an interdisciplinary course that can
a) be accessed by first-year undergraduate engineering students across any
domain, b) enable them to understand the basic workings of AI systems sans
mathematics, and c) make them appreciate AI's far-reaching implications on our
lives. The course was divided into three modules co-delivered by faculty from
both engineering and humanities. The planetary module explored AI's dual role
as both a catalyst for sustainability and a contributor to environmental
challenges. The societal impact module focused on AI biases and concerns around
privacy and fairness. Lastly, the workplace module highlighted AI-driven job
displacement, emphasizing the importance of adaptation. The novelty of this
course lies in its interdisciplinary curriculum design and pedagogical
approach, which combines technical instruction with societal discourse. Results
revealed that students' comprehension of AI challenges improved across diverse
metrics like (a) increased awareness of AI's environmental impact, and (b)
efficient corrective solutions for AI fairness. Furthermore, it also indicated
the evolution in students' perception of AI's transformative impact on our
lives.

Abstract: This research investigates the use of machine learning methods to forecast
students' academic performance in a school setting. Students' data with
behavioral, academic, and demographic details were used in implementations with
standard classical machine learning models including multi-layer perceptron
classifier (MLPC). MLPC obtained 86.46% maximum accuracy for test set across
all implementations. Under 10-fold cross validation, MLPC obtained 79.58%
average accuracy for test set while for train set, it was 99.65%. MLP's better
performance over other machine learning models strongly suggest the potential
use of neural networks as data-efficient models. Feature selection approach
played a crucial role in improving the performance and multiple evaluation
approaches were used in order to compare with existing literature. Explainable
machine learning methods were utilized to demystify the black box models and to
validate the feature selection approach.
