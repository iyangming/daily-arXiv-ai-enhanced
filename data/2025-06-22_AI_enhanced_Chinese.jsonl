They also require human grounding in multi-modal environments,\nwhich can be ad-hoc, rigid, and brittle. Neural networks are good at extracting\nrich contextual information from multi-modal data, but lack interpretable\nstructures for reasoning.\n  Objectives: CALM aims to bridge the gap between logic and neural perception,\ncreating an analog logic that can reason over multi-modal inputs. Without this\nintegration, AI systems remain either brittle or unstructured, unable to\ngeneralize robustly to real-world tasks. In CALM, symbolic predicates evaluate\nto analog truth values computed by neural networks and constrained search.\n  Methods: CALM represents each predicate using a domain tree, which\niteratively refines its analog truth value when the contextual groundings of\nits entities are determined. The iterative refinement is predicted by neural\nnetworks capable of capturing multi-modal information and is filtered through a\nsymbolic reasoning module to ensure constraint satisfaction.\n  Results: In fill-in-the-blank object placement tasks, CALM achieved 92.2%\naccuracy, outperforming classical logic (86.3%) and LLM (59.4%) baselines.

In this\nwork, we propose DAILOC, a novel domain-incremental learning framework that\njointly addresses both temporal and device-induced domain shifts. DAILOC\nintroduces a novel disentanglement strategy that separates domain shifts from\nlocation-relevant features using a multi-level variational autoencoder.\nAdditionally, we introduce a novel memory-guided class latent alignment\nmechanism to address the effects of catastrophic forgetting over time.\nExperiments across multiple smartphones, buildings, and time instances\ndemonstrate that DAILOC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods,\nachieving up to 2.74x lower average error and 4.6x lower worst-case error.", "AI": {"tldr": "DAILOC提出了一种新型域增量学习框架，通过解耦策略和多级变分自编码器解决Wi-Fi指纹室内定位中的设备异质性和时间变化问题，显著优于现有方法。", "motivation": "Wi-Fi指纹室内定位在设备异质性和环境时间变化下表现不佳，现有方法独立处理这些问题，导致泛化能力差和灾难性遗忘。", "method": "DAILOC采用多级变分自编码器解耦域偏移与位置特征，并引入记忆引导的潜在对齐机制防止灾难性遗忘。", "result": "实验表明，DAILOC在多个设备、建筑和时间实例中表现优异，平均误差降低2.74倍，最差情况误差降低4.6倍。", "conclusion": "DAILOC通过联合处理设备和时间域偏移，显著提升了室内定位的鲁棒性和准确性。"}}

This\nlack of interpretability hampers our ability to understand the impact of\ntemporal variations - caused by environmental dynamics - and to adapt models\nfor long-term reliability. To address this, we introduce LogNet, a novel logic\ngate-based framework designed to interpret and enhance DL-based indoor\nlocalization. LogNet enables transparent reasoning by identifying which access\npoints (APs) are most influential for each reference point (RP) and reveals how\nenvironmental noise disrupts DL-driven localization decisions. This\ninterpretability allows us to trace and diagnose model failures and adapt DL\nsystems for more stable long-term deployments. Evaluations across multiple\nreal-world building floorplans and over two years of temporal variation show\nthat LogNet not only interprets the internal behavior of DL models but also\nimproves performance-achieving up to 1.1x to 2.8x lower localization error,\n3.4x to 43.3x smaller model size, and 1.5x to 3.6x lower latency compared to\nprior DL-based models.", "AI": {"tldr": "LogNet是一个基于逻辑门的新型框架，旨在提升深度学习室内定位的可解释性和长期可靠性。", "motivation": "现有深度学习框架缺乏可解释性，难以应对环境动态变化，影响长期可靠性。", "method": "引入LogNet框架，通过逻辑门透明推理，识别关键接入点并分析环境噪声影响。", "result": "LogNet显著降低定位误差（1.1x至2.8x）、减小模型规模（3.4x至43.3x）并降低延迟（1.5x至3.6x）。", "conclusion": "LogNet不仅提升深度学习模型的可解释性，还优化了性能，适用于长期稳定部署。"}}
