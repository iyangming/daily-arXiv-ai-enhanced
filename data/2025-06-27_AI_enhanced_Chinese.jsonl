There is also a growing expectation for them\nto display human-like personalities during interactions. To meet this\nexpectation, numerous studies have proposed methods for modelling LLM\npersonalities through psychometric evaluations. However, most existing models\nface two major limitations: they rely on the Big Five (OCEAN) framework, which\nonly provides coarse personality dimensions, and they lack mechanisms for\ncontrolling trait intensity. In this paper, we address this gap by extending\nthe Machine Personality Inventory (MPI), which originally used the Big Five\nmodel, to incorporate the 16 Personality Factor (16PF) model, allowing\nexpressive control over sixteen distinct traits. We also developed a structured\nframework known as Specific Attribute Control (SAC) for evaluating and\ndynamically inducing trait intensity in LLMs. Our method introduces\nadjective-based semantic anchoring to guide trait intensity expression and\nleverages behavioural questions across five intensity factors:\n\\textit{Frequency}, \\textit{Depth}, \\textit{Threshold}, \\textit{Effort}, and\n\\textit{Willingness}.

This paper\nintroduces Omni-RAG, a novel framework designed to improve the robustness and\neffectiveness of RAG systems in live, open-domain settings. Omni-RAG employs\nLLM-assisted query understanding to preprocess user inputs through three key\nmodules: (1) Deep Query Understanding and Decomposition, which utilizes LLMs\nwith tailored prompts to denoise queries (e.g., correcting spelling errors) and\ndecompose multi-intent queries into structured sub-queries; (2) Intent-Aware\nKnowledge Retrieval, which performs retrieval for each sub-query from a corpus\n(i.e., FineWeb using OpenSearch) and aggregates the results; and (3) Reranking\nand Generation, where a reranker (i.e., BGE) refines document selection before\na final response is generated by an LLM (i.e., Falcon-10B) using a\nchain-of-thought prompt. Omni-RAG aims to bridge the gap between current RAG\ncapabilities and the demands of real-world applications, such as those\nhighlighted by the SIGIR 2025 LiveRAG Challenge, by robustly handling complex\nand noisy queries.", "AI": {"tldr": "Omni-RAG是一个新框架，旨在提升RAG系统在实时开放域环境中的鲁棒性和有效性，通过LLM辅助的查询理解和模块化处理复杂、嘈杂的查询。", "motivation": "现实中的RAG系统在处理嘈杂、模糊和多意图的用户查询时表现不佳，因为现有系统通常在干净数据上训练或评估。Omni-RAG试图填补这一能力差距。", "method": "Omni-RAG通过三个模块处理查询：(1)深度查询理解与分解，(2)意图感知的知识检索，(3)重新排序与生成。", "result": "Omni-RAG能够有效处理复杂和嘈杂的查询，提升RAG系统在实时应用中的表现。", "conclusion": "Omni-RAG为RAG系统在现实应用中的挑战提供了解决方案，特别是在处理复杂查询方面。"}}

This work introduces a general paradigm, DELT, for considering\ndata efficacy in LM training, which highlights the significance of training\ndata organization. DELT comprises three components: Data Scoring, Data\nSelection, and Data Ordering. Among these components, we design\nLearnability-Quality Scoring (LQS), as a new instance of Data Scoring, which\nconsiders both the learnability and quality of each data sample from the\ngradient consistency perspective. We also devise Folding Ordering (FO), as a\nnovel instance of Data Ordering, which addresses issues such as model\nforgetting and data distribution bias. Comprehensive experiments validate the\ndata efficacy in LM training, which demonstrates the following: Firstly,\nvarious instances of the proposed DELT enhance LM performance to varying\ndegrees without increasing the data scale and model size. Secondly, among these\ninstances, the combination of our proposed LQS for data scoring and Folding for\ndata ordering achieves the most significant improvement. Lastly, data efficacy\ncan be achieved together with data efficiency by applying data selection.\nTherefore, we believe that data efficacy is a promising foundational area in LM\ntraining.", "AI": {"tldr": "论文提出数据效能（Data Efficacy）的概念，通过优化训练数据的组织来提升语言模型性能，并提出了DELT范式，包含数据评分、选择和排序三个组件。实验验证了其有效性。", "motivation": "现有研究主要关注数据效率（如数据选择和过滤），而数据组织对性能的影响尚未充分探索。本文旨在填补这一空白。", "method": "提出DELT范式，包括数据评分（如LQS）、数据选择和数据排序（如FO），通过梯度一致性和折叠排序优化数据组织。", "result": "实验表明，DELT能不同程度提升模型性能，其中LQS和FO组合效果最佳，且数据效能与数据效率可同时实现。", "conclusion": "数据效能是语言模型训练中一个有前景的基础研究方向。"}}

We present\n\\textbf{ThinkSound}, a novel framework that leverages Chain-of-Thought (CoT)\nreasoning to enable stepwise, interactive audio generation and editing for\nvideos. Our approach decomposes the process into three complementary stages:\nfoundational foley generation that creates semantically coherent soundscapes,\ninteractive object-centric refinement through precise user interactions, and\ntargeted editing guided by natural language instructions. At each stage, a\nmultimodal large language model generates contextually aligned CoT reasoning\nthat guides a unified audio foundation model. Furthermore, we introduce\n\\textbf{AudioCoT}, a comprehensive dataset with structured reasoning\nannotations that establishes connections between visual content, textual\ndescriptions, and sound synthesis.

While increasing the\nnumber of angles generally improves image quality, it drastically reduces the\nframe rate and can introduce blurring artifacts in fast-moving targets.\nMoreover, compounded images remain susceptible to noise, particularly when\nacquired with a limited number of transmissions. We propose a zero-shot\ndenoising framework tailored for low-angle CPWC acquisitions, which enhances\ncontrast without relying on a separate training dataset. The method divides the\navailable transmission angles into two disjoint subsets, each used to form\ncompound images that include higher noise levels. The new compounded images are\nthen used to train a deep model via a self-supervised residual learning scheme,\nenabling it to suppress incoherent noise while preserving anatomical\nstructures. Because angle-dependent artifacts vary between the subsets while\nthe underlying tissue response is similar, this physics-informed pairing allows\nthe network to learn to disentangle the inconsistent artifacts from the\nconsistent tissue signal. Unlike supervised methods, our model requires no\ndomain-specific fine-tuning or paired data, making it adaptable across\nanatomical regions and acquisition setups. The entire pipeline supports\nefficient training with low computational cost due to the use of a lightweight\narchitecture, which comprises only two convolutional layers.
