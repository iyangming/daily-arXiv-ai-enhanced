### [1] [DiMo-GUI: Advancing Test-time Scaling in GUI Grounding via Modality-Aware Visual Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00008)
*Hang Wu,Hongkai Chen,Yujun Cai,Chang Liu,Qingwen Ye,Ming-Hsuan Yang,Yiwei Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DiMo-GUI是一个无需训练的GUI自然语言查询框架，通过动态视觉定位和模态感知优化，有效解决GUI中的视觉元素多样性和语言歧义问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GUI中的视觉元素多样性和语言歧义问题使得自然语言查询的定位具有挑战性。

Method: 将GUI拆分为文本和图标元素，利用通用视觉语言模型独立处理，并通过动态聚焦候选区域逐步细化定位结果。

Result: 在标准GUI基准测试中表现优于基线方法，证明了模态分离与区域聚焦推理的有效性。

Conclusion: DiMo-GUI通过动态视觉定位和模态感知优化，无需额外训练即可显著提升GUI自然语言查询的准确性。

Abstract: Grounding natural language queries in graphical user interfaces (GUIs) poses
unique challenges due to the diversity of visual elements, spatial clutter, and
the ambiguity of language. In this paper, we introduce DiMo-GUI, a
training-free framework for GUI grounding that leverages two core strategies:
dynamic visual grounding and modality-aware optimization. Instead of treating
the GUI as a monolithic image, our method splits the input into textual
elements and iconic elements, allowing the model to reason over each modality
independently using general-purpose vision-language models. When predictions
are ambiguous or incorrect, DiMo-GUI dynamically focuses attention by
generating candidate focal regions centered on the model's initial predictions
and incrementally zooms into subregions to refine the grounding result. This
hierarchical refinement process helps disambiguate visually crowded layouts
without the need for additional training or annotations. We evaluate our
approach on standard GUI grounding benchmarks and demonstrate consistent
improvements over baseline inference pipelines, highlighting the effectiveness
of combining modality separation with region-focused reasoning.

### [2] [TalentMine: LLM-Based Extraction and Question-Answering from Multimodal Talent Tables](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00041)
*Varun Mannam,Fang Wang,Chaochun Liu,Xin Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出TalentMine框架，通过增强语义表表示解决传统表格提取方法在人才管理中的信息丢失问题，显著提升查询准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统表格提取方法在语义理解上表现不佳，导致人才管理系统中关键信息检索失败，影响决策。

Method: 引入TalentMine框架，结合多模态推理生成语义丰富的表格表示，优于传统CSV或文本线性化方法。

Result: 实验显示TalentMine在查询任务中达到100%准确率，远超AWS Textract（0%）及其视觉Q&A功能（40%）。

Conclusion: TalentMine通过语义增强有效解决了表格信息丢失问题，为人才管理系统提供了高效检索方案。

Abstract: In talent management systems, critical information often resides in complex
tabular formats, presenting significant retrieval challenges for conventional
language models. These challenges are pronounced when processing Talent
documentation that requires precise interpretation of tabular relationships for
accurate information retrieval and downstream decision-making. Current table
extraction methods struggle with semantic understanding, resulting in poor
performance when integrated into retrieval-augmented chat applications. This
paper identifies a key bottleneck - while structural table information can be
extracted, the semantic relationships between tabular elements are lost,
causing downstream query failures. To address this, we introduce TalentMine, a
novel LLM-enhanced framework that transforms extracted tables into semantically
enriched representations. Unlike conventional approaches relying on CSV or text
linearization, our method employs specialized multimodal reasoning to preserve
both structural and semantic dimensions of tabular data. Experimental
evaluation across employee benefits document collections demonstrates
TalentMine's superior performance, achieving 100% accuracy in query answering
tasks compared to 0% for standard AWS Textract extraction and 40% for AWS
Textract Visual Q&A capabilities. Our comparative analysis also reveals that
the Claude v3 Haiku model achieves optimal performance for talent management
applications. The key contributions of this work include (1) a systematic
analysis of semantic information loss in current table extraction pipelines,
(2) a novel LLM-based method for semantically enriched table representation,
(3) an efficient integration framework for retrieval-augmented systems as
end-to-end systems, and (4) comprehensive benchmarks on talent analytics tasks
showing substantial improvements across multiple categories.

### [3] [A collaborative digital twin built on FAIR data and compute infrastructure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00048)
*Thomas M. Deucher,Juan C. Verduzco,Michael Titus,Alejandro Strachan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于FAIR数据基础设施的分布式自驱动实验室（SDL）框架，结合机器学习和自动化实验，加速科学和工程中的发现与优化任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过整合FAIR数据基础设施和SDL，促进地理分散的研究者协作，共享数据并利用机器学习模型进行优化。

Method: 使用nanoHUB服务构建分布式SDL框架，包括Sim2L处理数据、ResultsDB存储FAIR数据，以及基于主动学习的顺序优化工作流。

Result: 实现了通过简单网页界面提交数据、自动处理和分析，并成功应用于食品染料配方的优化任务。

Conclusion: 该框架具有通用性，可扩展至其他优化问题，同时为研究者和学生提供了低成本、易操作的实验平台。

Abstract: The integration of machine learning with automated experimentation in
self-driving laboratories (SDL) offers a powerful approach to accelerate
discovery and optimization tasks in science and engineering applications. When
supported by findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) data
infrastructure, SDLs with overlapping interests can collaborate more
effectively. This work presents a distributed SDL implementation built on
nanoHUB services for online simulation and FAIR data management. In this
framework, geographically dispersed collaborators conducting independent
optimization tasks contribute raw experimental data to a shared central
database. These researchers can then benefit from analysis tools and machine
learning models that automatically update as additional data become available.
New data points are submitted through a simple web interface and automatically
processed using a nanoHUB Sim2L, which extracts derived quantities and indexes
all inputs and outputs in a FAIR data repository called ResultsDB. A separate
nanoHUB workflow enables sequential optimization using active learning, where
researchers define the optimization objective, and machine learning models are
trained on-the-fly with all existing data, guiding the selection of future
experiments. Inspired by the concept of ``frugal twin", the optimization task
seeks to find the optimal recipe to combine food dyes to achieve the desired
target color. With easily accessible and inexpensive materials, researchers and
students can set up their own experiments, share data with collaborators, and
explore the combination of FAIR data, predictive ML models, and sequential
optimization. The tools introduced are generally applicable and can easily be
extended to other optimization problems.

### [4] [SEZ-HARN: Self-Explainable Zero-shot Human Activity Recognition Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00050)
*Devin Y. De Silva,Sandareka Wickramanayake,Dulani Meedeniya,Sanka Rasnayaka*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新型的自解释零样本人类活动识别模型（SEZ-HARN），能够识别未在训练中遇到的活动并提供解释性骨架视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有零样本HAR模型缺乏透明性和数据限制的问题。

Method: 提出SEZ-HARN模型，结合零样本学习和自解释能力，生成骨架视频解释决策过程。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上表现优异，零样本预测准确率接近最佳黑盒模型，同时提供可理解的解释。

Conclusion: SEZ-HARN在保持高准确率的同时，显著提升了模型的透明性和解释性。

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR), which uses data from Inertial Measurement
Unit (IMU) sensors, has many practical applications in healthcare and assisted
living environments. However, its use in real-world scenarios has been limited
by the lack of comprehensive IMU-based HAR datasets that cover a wide range of
activities and the lack of transparency in existing HAR models. Zero-shot HAR
(ZS-HAR) overcomes the data limitations, but current models struggle to explain
their decisions, making them less transparent. This paper introduces a novel
IMU-based ZS-HAR model called the Self-Explainable Zero-shot Human Activity
Recognition Network (SEZ-HARN). It can recognize activities not encountered
during training and provide skeleton videos to explain its decision-making
process. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed SEZ-HARN on four
benchmark datasets PAMAP2, DaLiAc, HTD-MHAD and MHealth and compare its
performance against three state-of-the-art black-box ZS-HAR models. The
experiment results demonstrate that SEZ-HARN produces realistic and
understandable explanations while achieving competitive Zero-shot recognition
accuracy. SEZ-HARN achieves a Zero-shot prediction accuracy within 3\% of the
best-performing black-box model on PAMAP2 while maintaining comparable
performance on the other three datasets.

### [5] [Enhancing Reasoning Capabilities in SLMs with Reward Guided Dataset Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00054)
*Shreyansh Padarha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AdvDistill提出了一种基于奖励的数据集蒸馏框架，通过多生成响应和规则验证器分配奖励，显著提升了小型语言模型在数学和复杂推理任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的知识蒸馏技术通常局限于学生模型复制教师模型的分布内响应，限制了其泛化能力，尤其是在推理任务上，且计算成本较高。

Method: AdvDistill利用教师模型对每个提示生成多个响应，并通过规则验证器分配奖励，这些奖励作为训练学生模型的权重。

Result: 实验表明，AdvDistill显著提升了学生模型在数学和复杂推理任务上的性能。

Conclusion: AdvDistill证明了在数据集蒸馏过程中引入奖励机制的有效性和优势。

Abstract: The push to compress and impart the proficiency of Large Language Models
(LLMs) into more deployable and efficient Small Language Models (SLMs) has
benefited from improvements in knowledge distillation (KD) techniques. These
techniques allow a smaller student model to learn from a more capable and
larger teacher model's responses. However, distillation often revolves around
the student model merely copying the teacher's in-distribution responses,
limiting its generalisability. This limitation is amplified on reasoning tasks
and can be computationally expensive. In this study, we propose AdvDistill, a
reward-guided dataset distillation framework. We utilise multiple generations
(responses) from a teacher for each prompt and assign rewards based on
rule-based verifiers. These varying and normally distributed rewards serve as
weights when training student models. Our methods and their subsequent
behavioural analysis demonstrate a significant improvement in student model
performance for mathematical and complex reasoning tasks, showcasing the
efficacy and benefits of incorporating a rewarding mechanism in dataset
distillation processes.

### [6] [VoyagerVision: Investigating the Role of Multi-modal Information for Open-ended Learning Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00079)
*Ethan Smyth,Alessandro Suglia*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出VoyagerVision，一种多模态模型，通过视觉反馈在Minecraft中构建结构，扩展了模型的开放性和任务能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究开放性是实现通用人工智能（AGI）的关键，而大型语言模型（LLMs）如GPT-4o已具备图像输入解析能力。通过视觉输入增强模型的空间理解能力，可以扩展其任务范围。

Method: 提出VoyagerVision模型，利用屏幕截图作为视觉反馈，在Minecraft中构建结构。基于Voyager模型，通过多模态输入实现任务扩展。

Result: VoyagerVision在50次迭代中平均构建2.75个独特结构，而Voyager无法实现。在平坦世界中，成功率为50%，复杂结构失败较多。

Conclusion: 视觉输入显著提升了模型的空间理解和任务能力，为开放性和多模态研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Open-endedness is an active field of research in the pursuit of capable
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), allowing models to pursue tasks of their
own choosing. Simultaneously, recent advancements in Large Language Models
(LLMs) such as GPT-4o [9] have allowed such models to be capable of
interpreting image inputs. Implementations such as OMNI-EPIC [4] have made use
of such features, providing an LLM with pixel data of an agent's POV to parse
the environment and allow it to solve tasks. This paper proposes that providing
these visual inputs to a model gives it greater ability to interpret spatial
environments, and as such, can increase the number of tasks it can successfully
perform, extending its open-ended potential. To this aim, this paper proposes
VoyagerVision -- a multi-modal model capable of creating structures within
Minecraft using screenshots as a form of visual feedback, building on the
foundation of Voyager. VoyagerVision was capable of creating an average of 2.75
unique structures within fifty iterations of the system, as Voyager was
incapable of this, it is an extension in an entirely new direction.
Additionally, in a set of building unit tests VoyagerVision was successful in
half of all attempts in flat worlds, with most failures arising in more complex
structures. Project website is available at

*Basab Jha,Firoj Paudel,Ujjwal Puri,Zhang Yuting,Choi Donghyuk,Wang Junhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“逆向推理”的新范式，使大语言模型（LLMs）能够分解并解释其推理过程，通过SAGE-nano模型展示了其在推理准确性和解释质量上的优越表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在推理过程中决策过程的黑箱问题，提升模型的透明度和可解释性。

Method: 采用逆向推理范式，通过元认知结构和注意力机制反向分析推理链，生成解释。

Result: SAGE-nano在AQUA-RAT等测试中表现出色，推理准确率达74.6%，解释质量获92.1%的人类偏好评分。

Conclusion: 逆向推理不仅提升了LLMs的推理性能，还增强了其可解释性，为透明AI系统开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities at
solving complex reasoning tasks with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, but
their decision-making processes remain somewhat blackbox. We introduce
textbfinverse reasoning, a novel paradigm enabling LLMs to decompose and
explain their own reasoning chains post-hoc. Our approach, used in SAGE-nano, a
4-billion-parameter reasoning model, employs a metacognitive structure that
reflects back via attention processes to identify major decision points and
generate explanations of reasoning choices. While typical CoT approaches are
directed towards forward reasoning generation, inverse reasoning provides
insight into why specific reasoning chains were selected over others. Through
thorough testing of logical reasoning puzzles, math problems and ethical
dilemmas from AQUA-RAT, CommonsenseQA, and customized benchmarks, we
demonstrate that SAGE-nano is at the cutting edge both on reasoning accuracy
(74.6% on AQUA-RAT) and explanation quality (92.1% human preference score) for
its task, and offers performance almost on par with models like Claude-3.5
Sonnet or GPT-4o. Our contributions are: (i) the first rigorous framework for
LLM self-reflection via inverse reasoning, (ii) a novel metalearning framework
to reverse the attention flow, (iii) comprehensive evaluation frameworks for
reasoning transparency, and (iv) evidence that increasing reasoning using
inverse reasoning improves interpretability along with reasoning performance.
Our work creates new avenues for transparent AI systems and closes significant
gaps in AI safety, education, and scientific discovery.

### [8] [BlackBoxToBlueprint: Extracting Interpretable Logic from Legacy Systems using Reinforcement Learning and Counterfactual Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00180)
*Vidhi Rathore*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于强化学习的自动化方法，从遗留系统中提取可解释的决策逻辑，并通过决策树生成人类可读的规则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遗留系统的现代化改造因缺乏文档和理解其复杂决策逻辑而困难，传统方法仅复制输入输出行为，无法捕捉底层意图。

Method: 使用强化学习代理探索输入空间，识别关键决策边界，并通过K-Means聚类和决策树训练提取可解释规则。

Result: 在三种不同复杂度的遗留系统上验证，提取的规则准确反映了系统的核心逻辑。

Conclusion: 该方法为遗留系统迁移中的规范和测试用例生成提供了有前景的基础。

Abstract: Modernizing legacy software systems is a critical but challenging task, often
hampered by a lack of documentation and understanding of the original system's
intricate decision logic. Traditional approaches like behavioral cloning merely
replicate input-output behavior without capturing the underlying intent. This
paper proposes a novel pipeline to automatically extract interpretable decision
logic from legacy systems treated as black boxes. The approach uses a
Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent to explore the input space and identify
critical decision boundaries by rewarding actions that cause meaningful changes
in the system's output. These counterfactual state transitions, where the
output changes, are collected and clustered using K-Means. Decision trees are
then trained on these clusters to extract human-readable rules that approximate
the system's decision logic near the identified boundaries. I demonstrated the
pipeline's effectiveness on three dummy legacy systems with varying complexity,
including threshold-based, combined-conditional, and non-linear range logic.
Results show that the RL agent successfully focuses exploration on relevant
boundary regions, and the extracted rules accurately reflect the core logic of
the underlying dummy systems, providing a promising foundation for generating
specifications and test cases during legacy migration.

*Georgios P. Georgiou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现，使用ChatGPT辅助写作的学生认知参与度显著低于未使用AI的对照组，表明AI可能导致认知卸载。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨生成式AI工具（如ChatGPT）对学生学术写作任务中认知参与的影响。

Method: 采用实验设计，随机分配学生至AI辅助（ChatGPT）或非辅助（对照组）条件，完成议论文写作任务并使用CES-AI量表评估认知参与度。

Result: ChatGPT组的认知参与度显著低于对照组。

Conclusion: AI辅助可能削弱学生的深度认知参与，需结合教学策略以促进主动反思性学习。

Abstract: Despite the increasing use of large language models (LLMs) in education,
concerns have emerged about their potential to reduce deep thinking and active
learning. This study investigates the impact of generative artificial
intelligence (AI) tools, specifically ChatGPT, on the cognitive engagement of
students during academic writing tasks. The study employed an experimental
design with participants randomly assigned to either an AI-assisted (ChatGPT)
or a non-assisted (control) condition. Participants completed a structured
argumentative writing task followed by a cognitive engagement scale (CES), the
CES-AI, developed to assess mental effort, attention, deep processing, and
strategic thinking. The results revealed significantly lower cognitive
engagement scores in the ChatGPT group compared to the control group. These
findings suggest that AI assistance may lead to cognitive offloading. The study
contributes to the growing body of literature on the psychological implications
of AI in education and raises important questions about the integration of such
tools into academic practice. It calls for pedagogical strategies that promote
active, reflective engagement with AI-generated content to avoid compromising
self-regulated learning and deep cognitive involvement of students.

TL;DR: xHAIM是一个基于生成式AI的框架，通过任务相关数据识别、患者摘要生成、预测建模和临床解释四步，提升医疗AI的可解释性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决HAIM框架在任务无关性和缺乏可解释性方面的局限性。

Method: 利用生成式AI，通过四步结构（数据识别、摘要生成、预测建模、临床解释）增强预测和可解释性。

Result: 在HAIM-MIMIC-MM数据集上，xHAIM将平均AUC从79.9%提升至90.3%。

Conclusion: xHAIM将AI从黑盒预测器转变为可解释的决策支持系统，提升临床实用性。

Abstract: With the increasing interest in deploying Artificial Intelligence in
medicine, we previously introduced HAIM (Holistic AI in Medicine), a framework
that fuses multimodal data to solve downstream clinical tasks. However, HAIM
uses data in a task-agnostic manner and lacks explainability. To address these
limitations, we introduce xHAIM (Explainable HAIM), a novel framework
leveraging Generative AI to enhance both prediction and explainability through
four structured steps: (1) automatically identifying task-relevant patient data
across modalities, (2) generating comprehensive patient summaries, (3) using
these summaries for improved predictive modeling, and (4) providing clinical
explanations by linking predictions to patient-specific medical knowledge.
Evaluated on the HAIM-MIMIC-MM dataset, xHAIM improves average AUC from 79.9%
to 90.3% across chest pathology and operative tasks. Importantly, xHAIM
transforms AI from a black-box predictor into an explainable decision support
system, enabling clinicians to interactively trace predictions back to relevant
patient data, bridging AI advancements with clinical utility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于NP难问题的复杂性，传统算法效率低，启发式方法无法保证最优性，而ML的成功应用为解决这些问题提供了新思路。

Method: 提出了基于构造和改进的ML方法分类，并分析了其在不同问题特性中的适用性。

Result: 综述了ML在路由问题中的应用，为未来研究提供了结构化框架。

Conclusion: 整合传统OR与ML技术，为新兴VRP变体的研究提供了指导。

Abstract: This paper reviews the current progress in applying machine learning (ML)
tools to solve NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems, with a focus on
routing problems such as the traveling salesman problem (TSP) and the vehicle
routing problem (VRP). Due to the inherent complexity of these problems, exact
algorithms often require excessive computational time to find optimal
solutions, while heuristics can only provide approximate solutions without
guaranteeing optimality. With the recent success of machine learning models,
there is a growing trend in proposing and implementing diverse ML techniques to
enhance the resolution of these challenging routing problems. We propose a
taxonomy categorizing ML-based routing methods into construction-based and
improvement-based approaches, highlighting their applicability to various
problem characteristics. This review aims to integrate traditional OR methods
with state-of-the-art ML techniques, providing a structured framework to guide
future research and address emerging VRP variants.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ASTRO是一个通过自回归搜索训练语言模型推理能力的框架，利用蒙特卡洛树搜索生成的数据集，结合强化学习，显著提升了Llama 3等模型在数学问题上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前开源推理模型依赖已有强推理能力的模型，而ASTRO旨在为非推理模型（如Llama 3）提供搜索行为内化的方法。

Method: 通过蒙特卡洛树搜索生成数学问题解决轨迹的合成数据集，将搜索痕迹转化为自然语言链式思维，结合强化学习微调模型。

Result: 在MATH-500、AMC 2023和AIME 2024等数学问题上，性能分别提升16.0%、26.9%和20.0%，尤其在需要迭代修正的难题上表现突出。

Conclusion: ASTRO证明了搜索启发的训练方法能有效为开源大语言模型注入稳健的推理能力。

Abstract: We introduce ASTRO, the "Autoregressive Search-Taught Reasoner", a framework
for training language models to reason like search algorithms, explicitly
leveraging self-reflection, backtracking, and exploration in their outputs.
Recently, training large language models (LLMs) via reinforcement learning (RL)
has led to the advent of reasoning models with greatly enhanced reasoning
capabilities. Open-source replications of reasoning models, while successful,
build upon models that already exhibit strong reasoning capabilities along with
search behavior observed even before RL. As a result, it is yet unclear how to
boost the reasoning capabilities of other non-reasoner models including Llama
3. ASTRO teaches such models to internalize structured search behavior through
a synthetic dataset derived from Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) over
mathematical problem-solving trajectories. By converting search traces into
natural language chain-of-thoughts that capture both successes and recoveries
from failure, ASTRO bootstraps models with a rich prior for exploration during
RL. We finetune our models on these search-derived traces and further improve
performance via RL with verifiable rewards. We apply ASTRO to the Llama 3
family of models and achieve absolute performance gains of 16.0% on MATH-500,
26.9% on AMC 2023, and 20.0% on AIME 2024, especially improving upon
challenging problems that require iterative correction. Our results demonstrate
that search-inspired training offers a principled way to instill robust
reasoning capabilities into open LLMs.

TL;DR: 研究发现，尽管LLMs在数学推理任务上表现优异，但多数模型无法将这种能力迁移到其他领域。强化学习调优的模型表现更好，而监督微调会导致能力退化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在数学推理上的进步是否反映其整体问题解决能力，还是仅局限于数学领域的过拟合。

Method: 评估20多个开源推理调优模型，涵盖数学、科学问答、规划、编码等任务，并对Qwen3-14B模型进行数学数据调优实验。

Result: 多数数学表现优秀的模型在其他领域表现不佳；强化学习调优的模型泛化能力更强，监督微调则导致能力退化。

Conclusion: 需重新考虑后训练方法，减少对监督微调数据的依赖，以提升模型的通用推理能力。

Abstract: Math reasoning has become the poster child of progress in large language
models (LLMs), with new models rapidly surpassing human-level performance on
benchmarks like MATH and AIME. But as math leaderboards improve week by week,
it is worth asking: do these gains reflect broader problem-solving ability or
just narrow overfitting? To answer this question, we evaluate over 20
open-weight reasoning-tuned models across a broad suite of tasks, including
math, scientific QA, agent planning, coding, and standard
instruction-following. We surprisingly find that most models that succeed in
math fail to transfer their gains to other domains. To rigorously study this
phenomenon, we conduct controlled experiments on Qwen3-14B models using
math-only data but different tuning methods. We find that reinforcement
learning (RL)-tuned models generalize well across domains, while supervised
fine-tuning (SFT)-tuned models often forget general capabilities. Latent-space
representation and token-space distribution shift analyses reveal that SFT
induces substantial representation and output drift, while RL preserves
general-domain structure. Our results suggest a need to rethink standard
post-training recipes, particularly the reliance on SFT-distilled data for
advancing reasoning models.

two-dimensional cell-jump move, called \emph{$2d$-cell-jump}, generalizing the
key operation, cell-jump, of the local search method for SMT-NRA. Then, we
propose an extended local search framework, named \emph{$2d$-LS} (following the
local search framework, LS, for SMT-NRA), integrating the model constructing
satisfiability calculus (MCSAT) framework to improve search efficiency. To
further improve the efficiency of MCSAT, we implement a recently proposed
technique called \emph{sample-cell projection operator} for MCSAT, which is
well suited for CDCL-style search in the real domain and helps guide the search
away from conflicting states. Finally, we design a hybrid framework for SMT-NRA
combining MCSAT, $2d$-LS and OpenCAD, to improve search efficiency through
information exchange. The experimental results demonstrate improvements in
local search performance, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed
methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM是否可以通过RL在象棋中发展战略推理能力，填补该领域的研究空白。

Method: 利用预训练的象棋动作价值网络为LLM的输出动作质量提供密集奖励（知识蒸馏），并与稀疏奖励进行对比。

Result: 密集奖励通常优于稀疏奖励，但所有模型表现均远低于专家水平。

Conclusion: 预训练模型对象棋的内部理解不足可能是性能瓶颈，仅靠RL难以完全克服。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs) has shown
promise in mathematical reasoning, strategic reasoning for LLMs using RL
remains largely unexplored. We investigate whether LLMs can develop strategic
reasoning capabilities through RL in chess. To this end, we leverage a
chess-pretrained action-value network to provide dense reward on the LLM's
output move quality, which can be seen as a form of knowledge distillation. Our
experiments show that our distillation-based dense rewards often outperform
sparse binary rewards. However, surprisingly, all models plateau far below
expert levels. We provide SFT and RL ablations on chess reasoning training and
find evidence that this limitation stems from a deficit in the pretrained
models' internal understanding of chess--a deficit which RL alone may not be
able to fully overcome.

Result: 初步验证显示，该方法能提升风险行为识别能力，降低代理被越狱的概率。

Conclusion: 该研究为多模态智能代理系统的安全风险建模与防护提供了有价值的参考。

Abstract: With the wide application of multimodal foundation models in intelligent
agent systems, scenarios such as mobile device control, intelligent assistant
interaction, and multimodal task execution are gradually relying on such large
model-driven agents. However, the related systems are also increasingly exposed
to potential jailbreak risks. Attackers may induce the agents to bypass the
original behavioral constraints through specific inputs, and then trigger
certain risky and sensitive operations, such as modifying settings, executing
unauthorized commands, or impersonating user identities, which brings new
challenges to system security. Existing security measures for intelligent
agents still have limitations when facing complex interactions, especially in
detecting potentially risky behaviors across multiple rounds of conversations
or sequences of tasks. In addition, an efficient and consistent automated
methodology to assist in assessing and determining the impact of such risks is
currently lacking. This work explores the security issues surrounding mobile
multimodal agents, attempts to construct a risk discrimination mechanism by
incorporating behavioral sequence information, and designs an automated
assisted assessment scheme based on a large language model. Through preliminary
validation in several representative high-risk tasks, the results show that the
method can improve the recognition of risky behaviors to some extent and assist
in reducing the probability of agents being jailbroken. We hope that this study
can provide some valuable references for the security risk modeling and
protection of multimodal intelligent agent systems.

Method: 通过跨学科综合，结合人工智能、认知神经科学、心理学等领域，分析通用智能的架构和认知基础，提出Agentic RAG框架、信息压缩等方法。

Conclusion: 结论强调了AGI发展的关键挑战，包括科学、技术和伦理问题，并展望了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Can machines truly think, reason and act in domains like humans? This
enduring question continues to shape the pursuit of Artificial General
Intelligence (AGI). Despite the growing capabilities of models such as GPT-4.5,
DeepSeek, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Phi-4, and Grok 3, which exhibit multimodal
fluency and partial reasoning, these systems remain fundamentally limited by
their reliance on token-level prediction and lack of grounded agency. This
paper offers a cross-disciplinary synthesis of AGI development, spanning
artificial intelligence, cognitive neuroscience, psychology, generative models,
and agent-based systems. We analyze the architectural and cognitive foundations
of general intelligence, highlighting the role of modular reasoning, persistent
memory, and multi-agent coordination. In particular, we emphasize the rise of
Agentic RAG frameworks that combine retrieval, planning, and dynamic tool use
to enable more adaptive behavior. We discuss generalization strategies,
including information compression, test-time adaptation, and training-free
methods, as critical pathways toward flexible, domain-agnostic intelligence.
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are reexamined not just as perception modules but
as evolving interfaces for embodied understanding and collaborative task
completion. We also argue that true intelligence arises not from scale alone
but from the integration of memory and reasoning: an orchestration of modular,
interactive, and self-improving components where compression enables adaptive
behavior. Drawing on advances in neurosymbolic systems, reinforcement learning,
and cognitive scaffolding, we explore how recent architectures begin to bridge
the gap between statistical learning and goal-directed cognition. Finally, we
identify key scientific, technical, and ethical challenges on the path to AGI.

Abstract: As autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) continue to
demonstrate potential across various assistive tasks, ensuring their safe and
reliable behavior is crucial for preventing unintended consequences. In this
work, we introduce CIP, a novel technique that leverages causal influence
diagrams (CIDs) to identify and mitigate risks arising from agent
decision-making. CIDs provide a structured representation of cause-and-effect
relationships, enabling agents to anticipate harmful outcomes and make safer
decisions. Our approach consists of three key steps: (1) initializing a CID
based on task specifications to outline the decision-making process, (2)
guiding agent interactions with the environment using the CID, and (3)
iteratively refining the CID based on observed behaviors and outcomes.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively enhances safety in
both code execution and mobile device control tasks.

Motivation: 表格是结构化数据的重要工具，但LLM在表格处理方面的效率尚未充分研究。

Method: 通过跨领域和跨模态评估，比较LLM在不同表格类型（科学与非科学）和格式（图像与文本）中的表现，并进行可解释性分析。

Result: LLM在表格模态间表现稳健，但在处理科学表格时面临显著挑战。

Conclusion: 研究提出了TableEval基准，并强调LLM在科学表格处理中的局限性。

Abstract: Tables are among the most widely used tools for representing structured data
in research, business, medicine, and education. Although LLMs demonstrate
strong performance in downstream tasks, their efficiency in processing tabular
data remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of
both text-based and multimodal LLMs on table understanding tasks through a
cross-domain and cross-modality evaluation. Specifically, we compare their
performance on tables from scientific vs. non-scientific contexts and examine
their robustness on tables represented as images vs. text. Additionally, we
conduct an interpretability analysis to measure context usage and input
relevance. We also introduce the TableEval benchmark, comprising 3017 tables
from scholarly publications, Wikipedia, and financial reports, where each table
is provided in five different formats: Image, Dictionary, HTML, XML, and LaTeX.
Our findings indicate that while LLMs maintain robustness across table
modalities, they face significant challenges when processing scientific tables.

Motivation: 探讨提示在LLMs研究中的科学地位，反驳将其视为‘玄学’的观点。

Method: 通过类比LLMs为复杂生物体，将提示视为行为科学的研究工具。

Result: 提示是LLMs科学的关键组成部分，而非权宜之计。

Conclusion: 提示应被正式认可为LLMs研究的重要科学方法。

Abstract: Prompting is the primary method by which we study and control large language
models. It is also one of the most powerful: nearly every major capability
attributed to LLMs-few-shot learning, chain-of-thought, constitutional AI-was
first unlocked through prompting. Yet prompting is rarely treated as science
and is frequently frowned upon as alchemy. We argue that this is a category
error. If we treat LLMs as a new kind of complex and opaque organism that is
trained rather than programmed, then prompting is not a workaround: it is
behavioral science. Mechanistic interpretability peers into the neural
substrate, prompting probes the model in its native interface: language. We
contend that prompting is not inferior, but rather a key component in the
science of LLMs.

Method: 提出LineRetriever方法，利用语言模型识别和检索与未来导航步骤最相关的观察行，而非仅依赖语义相似性。

Result: 实验表明，LineRetriever能在保持性能的同时，减少每一步的观察数据量，适应上下文限制。

Conclusion: LineRetriever通过优化检索方法，显著提升了网页导航任务中自适应规划的效果。

Abstract: While large language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in web
navigation tasks, the extensive context of web pages, often represented as DOM
or Accessibility Tree (AxTree) structures, frequently exceeds model context
limits. Current approaches like bottom-up truncation or embedding-based
retrieval lose critical information about page state and action history. This
is particularly problematic for adaptive planning in web agents, where
understanding the current state is essential for determining future actions. We
hypothesize that embedding models lack sufficient capacity to capture
plan-relevant information, especially when retrieving content that supports
future action prediction. This raises a fundamental question: how can retrieval
methods be optimized for adaptive planning in web navigation tasks? In
response, we introduce \textit{LineRetriever}, a novel approach that leverages
a language model to identify and retrieve observation lines most relevant to
future navigation steps. Unlike traditional retrieval methods that focus solely
on semantic similarity, \textit{LineRetriever} explicitly considers the
planning horizon, prioritizing elements that contribute to action prediction.
Our experiments demonstrate that \textit{LineRetriever} can reduce the size of
the observation at each step for the web agent while maintaining consistent
performance within the context limitations.

Motivation: 传统分类模型缺乏显式推理，限制了性能、鲁棒性和可解释性。

Result: 生成推理和情感的分类器比仅生成情感的分类器准确率提高了8.7个百分点。

Conclusion: LLM生成的推理能丰富训练数据，提升下游任务性能并提供显式解释。

Abstract: Standard classification models often map inputs directly to labels without
explicit reasoning, potentially limiting their performance, robustness, and
interpretability. This paper introduces a novel two-stage approach to enhance
text classification by leveraging Large Language Model (LLM)-generated
reasonings. In the first stage, we fine-tune a Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct model
(henceforth Llama-R-Gen) on a general-purpose reasoning dataset
(syvai/reasoning-gen) to generate textual reasoning (R) given a question and
its answer. In the second stage, this generally trained Llama-R-Gen is used
offline to create an augmented training dataset for a downstream generative
model. This downstream model, based on Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct, takes only the
input text (Q) and is trained to output the generated reasoning (R) immediately
followed by the predicted emotion (A). We demonstrate this methodology on the
dair-ai/emotion dataset for emotion classification. Our experiments show that
the generative model trained to output reasoning and the emotion (Classifier
Q->RA) achieves a significant improvement of 8.7 percentage points in accuracy
(for emotion prediction) compared to a baseline generative model trained solely
to output the emotion (Classifier Q->A), highlighting the strong generalization
capabilities of the reasoning generation and the benefit of explicit reasoning
training. This work underscores the potential of LLM-generated reasonings for
creating richer training datasets, thereby improving the performance of diverse
downstream NLP tasks and providing explicit explanations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文化差异常导致说话者意图与听者理解之间的风格不对齐，例如礼貌在翻译中丢失。

Method: 提出RASTA（检索增强的风格对齐）方法，利用学习到的风格概念促进LLM翻译的文化规范对齐。

Result: LLMs在非西方语言中表现较差，且偏向中性翻译。RASTA方法有效改善了风格对齐。

Conclusion: RASTA方法能帮助LLMs更好地传达文化沟通规范，提升翻译中的风格对齐。

Abstract: Successful communication depends on the speaker's intended style (i.e., what
the speaker is trying to convey) aligning with the listener's interpreted style
(i.e., what the listener perceives). However, cultural differences often lead
to misalignment between the two; for example, politeness is often lost in
translation. We characterize the ways that LLMs fail to translate style -
biasing translations towards neutrality and performing worse in non-Western
languages. We mitigate these failures with RASTA (Retrieval-Augmented STylistic
Alignment), a method that leverages learned stylistic concepts to encourage LLM
translation to appropriately convey cultural communication norms and align
style.

Motivation: 探讨指令微调是否真正消除了语言模型中的有害信息，或仅是抑制了其直接表达。

Method: 使用线性探针训练在LM隐藏状态上，解码被拒绝的信息，并测试其在指令微调模型中的可解码性。

Result: 线性探针能高精度解码被拒绝的信息（如国家平均IQ），且基模型探针可迁移到指令微调模型。

Conclusion: 指令微调未消除有害信息，仅抑制其直接表达，这些信息仍线性可解码并间接影响下游行为。

Abstract: Most commonly used language models (LMs) are instruction-tuned and aligned
using a combination of fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, causing them to
refuse users requests deemed harmful by the model. However, jailbreak prompts
can often bypass these refusal mechanisms and elicit harmful responses. In this
work, we study the extent to which information accessed via jailbreak prompts
is decodable using linear probes trained on LM hidden states. We show that a
great deal of initially refused information is linearly decodable. For example,
across models, the response of a jailbroken LM for the average IQ of a country
can be predicted by a linear probe with Pearson correlations exceeding $0.8$.
Surprisingly, we find that probes trained on base models (which do not refuse)
sometimes transfer to their instruction-tuned versions and are capable of
revealing information that jailbreaks decode generatively, suggesting that the
internal representations of many refused properties persist from base LMs
through instruction-tuning. Importantly, we show that this information is not
merely "leftover" in instruction-tuned models, but is actively used by them: we
find that probe-predicted values correlate with LM generated pairwise
comparisons, indicating that the information decoded by our probes align with
suppressed generative behavior that may be expressed more subtly in other
downstream tasks. Overall, our results suggest that instruction-tuning does not
wholly eliminate or even relocate harmful information in representation
space-they merely suppress its direct expression, leaving it both linearly
accessible and indirectly influential in downstream behavior.

Conclusion: 结论指出，该模型为形态-句法接口提供了严格的数学描述，并支持形态与句法边界的灵活性。

Abstract: Within the context of the mathematical formulation of Merge and the Strong
Minimalist Thesis, we present a mathematical model of the morphology-syntax
interface. In this setting, morphology has compositional properties responsible
for word formation, organized into a magma of morphological trees. However,
unlike syntax, we do not have movement within morphology. A coproduct
decomposition exists, but it requires extending the set of morphological trees
beyond those which are generated solely by the magma, to a larger set of
possible morphological inputs to syntactic trees. These participate in the
formation of morphosyntactic trees as an algebra over an operad, and a
correspondence between algebras over an operad. The process of structure
formation for morphosyntactic trees can then be described in terms of this
operadic correspondence that pairs syntactic and morphological data and the
morphology coproduct. We reinterpret in this setting certain operations of
Distributed Morphology as transformation that allow for flexibility in moving
the boundary between syntax and morphology within the morphosyntactic objects.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in Language Reasoning Models (LRMs), most research

multilingual data. In this work, we investigate: Is English the most
token-efficient language for reasoning? We evaluate three open-source RLMs:
DeepSeek R1, Qwen 2.5 and Qwen 3, across four math datasets and seven
typologically diverse languages. We find that reasoning in non-English
languages not only reduces token usage, but also preserves accuracy. These
gains persist even after translating the reasoning traces into English,
suggesting genuine shifts in reasoning behavior rather than surface-level
linguistic effects. The extent of improvement, however, depends on the models
multilingual strength. Our findings motivate a broader view of reasoning in
language models, highlighting the potential of multilingual reasoning and the
importance of strong multilingual foundations. The code for our work can be

Result: 基于提示的微调在性能上具有竞争力，且对MIAs的脆弱性较低，无论模型规模如何。

Conclusion: 基于参数的微调更容易泄露隐私信息，而基于提示的微调是一种更隐私安全的替代方案。

Abstract: As the capabilities of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) continue to
advance, the "pre-train and fine-tune" paradigm has become increasingly
mainstream, leading to the development of various fine-tuning methods. However,
the privacy risks arising from memorization during fine-tuning have received
relatively little attention. To address this gap, we categorize popular
fine-tuning approaches and assess their impact on memorization through the lens
of membership inference attacks (MIAs). Our results show that, compared to
parameter-based fine-tuning, prompt-based fine-tuning achieves competitive
performance while exhibiting lower vulnerability to MIAs. Furthermore,
prompt-based methods maintain low memorization regardless of model scale. These
findings suggest that parameter-based fine-tuning is more prone to leaking
private information, whereas prompt-based fine-tuning serves as a more
privacy-preserving option.

Abstract: Recent advances in word embeddings and language models use large-scale,
unlabelled data and self-supervised learning to boost NLP performance.
Multilingual models, often trained on web-sourced data like Wikipedia, face
challenges: few low-resource languages are included, their data is often noisy,
and lack of labeled datasets makes it hard to evaluate performance outside
high-resource languages like English. In this dissertation, we focus on
languages spoken in Sub-Saharan Africa where all the indigenous languages in
this region can be regarded as low-resourced in terms of the availability of
labelled data for NLP tasks and unlabelled data found on the web. We analyse
the noise in the publicly available corpora, and curate a high-quality corpus,
demonstrating that the quality of semantic representations learned in word
embeddings does not only depend on the amount of data but on the quality of
pre-training data. We demonstrate empirically the limitations of word
embeddings, and the opportunities the multilingual pre-trained language model
(PLM) offers especially for languages unseen during pre-training and
low-resource scenarios. We further study how to adapt and specialize
multilingual PLMs to unseen African languages using a small amount of
monolingual texts. To address the under-representation of the African languages
in NLP research, we developed large scale human-annotated labelled datasets for
21 African languages in two impactful NLP tasks: named entity recognition and
machine translation. We conduct an extensive empirical evaluation using
state-of-the-art methods across supervised, weakly-supervised, and transfer
learning settings.

Abstract: Despite remarkable advances in coding capabilities, language models (LMs)
still struggle with simple syntactic tasks such as generating balanced
parentheses. In this study, we investigate the underlying mechanisms behind the
persistence of these errors across LMs of varying sizes (124M-7B) to both
understand and mitigate the errors. Our study reveals that LMs rely on a number
of components (attention heads and FF neurons) that independently make their
own predictions. While some components reliably promote correct answers across
a generalized range of inputs (i.e., implementing "sound mechanisms''), others
are less reliable and introduce noise by promoting incorrect tokens (i.e.,
implementing "faulty mechanisms''). Errors occur when the faulty mechanisms
overshadow the sound ones and dominantly affect the predictions. Motivated by
this insight, we introduce RASteer, a steering method to systematically
identify and increase the contribution of reliable components for improving
model performance. RASteer substantially improves performance on balanced
parentheses tasks, boosting accuracy of some models from $0$% to around $100$%
without impairing the models' general coding ability. We further demonstrate
its broader applicability in arithmetic reasoning tasks, achieving performance
gains of up to around $20$%.

*Mohna Chakraborty,Adithya Kulkarni,Qi Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: COLDSELECT是一种联合选择verbalizer和实例的方法，通过建模数据多样性，优化不确定性和多样性，提升冷启动场景下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法对模板、verbalizer和少样本实例选择敏感，且忽视了实例与verbalizer之间的依赖关系。

Method: 将PLM词汇和$h_{[MASK]}$嵌入映射到共享空间，通过降维和聚类实现高效多样的选择。

Result: 在八个基准测试中，COLDSELECT在减少不确定性和增强泛化能力方面优于基线方法。

Conclusion: COLDSELECT在冷启动场景中显著提升了verbalizer和少样本实例选择的效果。

Abstract: Prompt-based methods leverage the knowledge of pre-trained language models
(PLMs) trained with a masked language modeling (MLM) objective; however, these
methods are sensitive to template, verbalizer, and few-shot instance selection,
particularly in cold-start settings with no labeled data. Existing studies
overlook the dependency between instances and verbalizers, where instance-label
probabilities depend on verbalizer token proximity in the embedding space. To
address this, we propose COLDSELECT, a joint verbalizer and instance selection
approach that models data diversity. COLDSELECT maps PLM vocabulary and
$h_{[MASK]}$ embeddings into a shared space, applying dimensionality reduction
and clustering to ensure efficient and diverse selection. By optimizing for
minimal uncertainty and maximal diversity, COLDSELECT captures data
relationships effectively. Experiments on eight benchmarks demonstrate
COLDSELECT's superiority in reducing uncertainty and enhancing generalization,
outperforming baselines in verbalizer and few-shot instance selection for
cold-start scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合问题分解和重排的RAG方法，以解决多跳问题中的检索不足问题，显著提升了检索和回答的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多跳问题中，相关信息分散在多个文档中，标准RAG方法难以检索足够证据。

Method: 采用问题分解（LLM分解原问题为子问题）、检索子问题相关段落，并通过重排合并候选池以提高证据覆盖率和精度。

Result: 在MultiHop-RAG和HotpotQA上，检索（MRR@10提升36.7%）和答案准确性（F1提升11.6%）显著优于标准RAG。

Conclusion: 问题分解与重排结合是提升多跳问题RAG性能的有效方法，无需额外训练或索引。

Abstract: Grounding large language models (LLMs) in verifiable external sources is a
well-established strategy for generating reliable answers. Retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) is one such approach, particularly effective for tasks like
question answering: it retrieves passages that are semantically related to the
question and then conditions the model on this evidence. However, multi-hop
questions, such as "Which company among NVIDIA, Apple, and Google made the
biggest profit in 2023?," challenge RAG because relevant facts are often
distributed across multiple documents rather than co-occurring in one source,
making it difficult for standard RAG to retrieve sufficient information. To
address this, we propose a RAG pipeline that incorporates question
decomposition: (i) an LLM decomposes the original query into sub-questions,
(ii) passages are retrieved for each sub-question, and (iii) the merged
candidate pool is reranked to improve the coverage and precision of the
retrieved evidence. We show that question decomposition effectively assembles
complementary documents, while reranking reduces noise and promotes the most
relevant passages before answer generation. Although reranking itself is
standard, we show that pairing an off-the-shelf cross-encoder reranker with
LLM-driven question decomposition bridges the retrieval gap on multi-hop
questions and provides a practical, drop-in enhancement, without any extra
training or specialized indexing. We evaluate our approach on the MultiHop-RAG
and HotpotQA, showing gains in retrieval (MRR@10: +36.7%) and answer accuracy
(F1: +11.6%) over standard RAG baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了格里高利圣歌的旋律分段理论（centonisation），通过无监督分层Pitman-Yor语言模型寻找最优分段，发现其在调式分类中表现优异，但结果不支持传统centonisation理论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究格里高利圣歌旋律的分段理论（centonisation），探索其与记忆效率和调式分类的关系。

Method: 使用无监督分层Pitman-Yor语言模型对圣歌旋律进行最优分段，并分析其与调式分类和记忆效率的关联。

Result: 最优分段在调式分类中表现优异，但分段结果不支持传统centonisation理论；旋律的开头和结尾更公式化。

Conclusion: 尽管分段在调式分类中有效，但记忆最优的分段与传统centonisation理论不符，表明后者可能不成立。

Abstract: The idea that Gregorian melodies are constructed from some vocabulary of
segments has long been a part of chant scholarship. This so-called
"centonisation" theory has received much musicological criticism, but frequent
re-use of certain melodic segments has been observed in chant melodies, and the
intractable number of possible segmentations allowed the option that some
undiscovered segmentation exists that will yet prove the value of
centonisation, and recent empirical results have shown that segmentations can
outperform music-theoretical features in mode classification. Inspired by the
fact that Gregorian chant was memorised, we search for an optimal unsupervised
segmentation of chant melody using nested hierarchical Pitman-Yor language
models. The segmentation we find achieves state-of-the-art performance in mode
classification. Modeling a monk memorising the melodies from one liturgical
manuscript, we then find empirical evidence for the link between mode
classification and memory efficiency, and observe more formulaic areas at the
beginnings and ends of melodies corresponding to the practical role of modality
in performance. However, the resulting segmentations themselves indicate that
even such a memory-optimal segmentation is not what is understood as
centonisation.

TL;DR: CAPITAL是一个因果提示框架，通过将前门调整融入思维链推理，解决了隐式情感分析中因果有效性问题，提升了准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于提示的大语言模型方法在隐式情感分析中依赖多数投票，未评估因果有效性，易受内部偏见和虚假相关影响。

Method: CAPITAL将总体因果效应分解为输入提示对推理链的影响和推理链对最终输出的影响，采用编码器聚类和NWGM近似估计，结合对比学习目标。

Result: 在三个大语言模型上的实验表明，CAPITAL在准确性和鲁棒性上均优于基线方法，尤其在对抗条件下表现突出。

Conclusion: CAPITAL为将因果推理融入大语言模型提示提供了原则性方法，强调了其在偏见感知情感推理中的优势。

Abstract: Implicit Sentiment Analysis (ISA) aims to infer sentiment that is implied
rather than explicitly stated, requiring models to perform deeper reasoning
over subtle contextual cues. While recent prompting-based methods using Large
Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in ISA, they often rely on majority
voting over chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning paths without evaluating their
causal validity, making them susceptible to internal biases and spurious
correlations. To address this challenge, we propose CAPITAL, a causal prompting
framework that incorporates front-door adjustment into CoT reasoning. CAPITAL
decomposes the overall causal effect into two components: the influence of the
input prompt on the reasoning chains, and the impact of those chains on the
final output. These components are estimated using encoder-based clustering and
the NWGM approximation, with a contrastive learning objective used to better
align the encoder's representation with the LLM's reasoning space. Experiments
on benchmark ISA datasets with three LLMs demonstrate that CAPITAL consistently
outperforms strong prompting baselines in both accuracy and robustness,
particularly under adversarial conditions. This work offers a principled
approach to integrating causal inference into LLM prompting and highlights its
benefits for bias-aware sentiment reasoning. The source code and case study are

Result: 显著提高了语言模型与多样化人群的对齐能力，并提供了具体群体间的差异分析。

Conclusion: 方法的简单性和通用性易于采用，为实践中的使用提供了指导，并开源以促进未来研究。

Abstract: The ability to accurately predict how different population groups would
answer subjective questions would have great value. In this work, we show that
use of relatively simple supervision can greatly improve language model
alignment with diverse population groups, as measured over three datasets
spanning various topics. Beyond evaluating average performance, we also report
how alignment varies across specific groups. The simplicity and generality of
our approach promotes easy adoption, while our broad findings provide useful
guidance for when to use or not use our approach in practice. By conducting
evaluation over many LLMs and prompting strategies, along with open-sourcing
our work, we provide a useful benchmark to stimulate future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示开放基准测试（如HELM和BIG-bench）的潜在问题，证明其可能被滥用，导致评估结果失真。

Method: 构造小型作弊模型（基于BART、T5和GPT-2），直接在公开测试集上微调，并在HELM基准上测试。

Result: 作弊模型在HELM基准上表现优异，但实际泛化能力差，实用性有限。

Conclusion: 需结合私有或动态基准测试，重新评估当前基准实践，以确保语言模型评估的可靠性和真实性。

Abstract: Open Large Language Model (LLM) benchmarks, such as HELM and BIG-bench, offer
standardized, transparent protocols that facilitate the fair comparison,
reproducibility, and iterative advancement of Language Models (LMs). However,
their openness also introduces critical and underexplored pitfalls. This study
exposes these weaknesses by systematically constructing ``cheating'' models --
smaller variants of BART, T5, and GPT-2 fine-tuned directly on public test sets
-- which achieve top rankings on a prominent open, holistic benchmark (HELM)
despite poor generalization and limited practical utility. Our findings
underscore three key insights: \ca high leaderboard performance on open
benchmarks may not always reflect real-world effectiveness; \cb private or
dynamic benchmarks must complement open evaluations to safeguard integrity; and
\cc a fundamental reevaluation of current benchmarking practices is essential
to ensure robust and trustworthy LM assessments.

Motivation: 随着生成式搜索系统的发展，广告与信息内容的界限模糊，影响了透明度和用户信任，因此需要一种有效的广告管理方法。

Method: 采用合成数据训练广告分类器，并基于分类器指导广告重写器的微调和最佳候选选择策略（best-of-N sampling）。

Result: 实验表明，分类器在检测广告方面表现优异，且分类器指导的优化显著提升了广告的隐蔽性。

Conclusion: 研究为广告感知生成系统和鲁棒广告分类器的开发提供了对抗性共进化框架。

Abstract: As conversational search engines increasingly adopt generation-based
paradigms powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG), the integration of advertisements into generated responses
presents both commercial opportunities and challenges for user experience.
Unlike traditional search, where advertisements are clearly delineated,
generative systems blur the boundary between informational content and
promotional material, raising concerns around transparency and trust. In this
work, we propose a modular pipeline for advertisement management in RAG-based
conversational systems, consisting of an ad-rewriter for seamless ad
integration and a robust ad-classifier for detection. We leverage synthetic
data to train high-performing classifiers, which are then used to guide two
complementary ad-integration strategies: supervised fine-tuning of the
ad-rewriter and a best-of-N sampling approach that selects the least detectable
ad-integrated response among multiple candidates. Our evaluation focuses on two
core questions: the effectiveness of ad classifiers in detecting diverse ad
integration strategies, and the training methods that best support coherent,
minimally intrusive ad insertion. Experimental results show that our
ad-classifier, trained on synthetic advertisement data inspired by marketing
strategies and enhanced through curriculum learning, achieves robust detection
performance. Additionally, we demonstrate that classifier-guided optimization,
through both fine-tuning and best-of-N sampling, significantly improves ad
stealth, enabling more seamless integration. These findings contribute an
adversarial co-evolution framework for developing more sophisticated ad-aware
generative search systems and robust ad classifiers.

Method: 利用自然增量收集的3250小时语音数据（含1720小时新数据），评估语言增量、领域增量及混合增量学习场景。

Result: 现有方法在动态场景中表现不一致，表明需要更鲁棒的持续学习策略。

Conclusion: Nirantar为持续学习研究提供了真实且动态的测试平台，凸显了现有方法的不足。

Abstract: We introduce Nirantar, a comprehensive framework for evaluating continual
learning (CL) in multilingual and multi-domain ASR. Designed to reflect
real-world CL challenges, Nirantar leverages data collected incrementally
across 22 languages and 208 districts in India through natural episodes. This
enables evaluation across Language-Incremental (LIL), Domain-Incremental (DIL),
and the novel Language-Incremental Domain-Incremental Learning (LIDIL)
scenarios. Unlike prior work that relies on simulated episodes, Nirantar
presents dynamic, non-uniform language and domain shifts, making it an ideal
testbed for CL research. With 3250 hours of human-transcribed speech, including
1720 hours newly introduced in this work, our framework enables systematic
benchmarking of CL methods. We evaluate existing approaches and demonstrate
that no single method performs consistently well, underscoring the need for
more robust CL strategies.

Method: 使用向量化胶囊结构表示语义特征，通过动态路由机制在多个胶囊层间传递信息，并结合卷积特征提取模块和基于边界的损失函数。

Result: 在公开数据集上实验表明，该模型在准确性、F1分数和意图检测率上优于传统方法和深度学习结构。

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂语义条件下的意图识别提供了一种新的结构化建模方法，验证了其稳定性和有效性。

Abstract: This paper proposes a user semantic intent modeling algorithm based on
Capsule Networks to address the problem of insufficient accuracy in intent
recognition for human-computer interaction. The method represents semantic
features in input text through a vectorized capsule structure. It uses a
dynamic routing mechanism to transfer information across multiple capsule
layers. This helps capture hierarchical relationships and part-whole structures
between semantic entities more effectively. The model uses a convolutional
feature extraction module as the low-level encoder. After generating initial
semantic capsules, it forms high-level abstract intent representations through
an iterative routing process. To further enhance performance, a margin-based
mechanism is introduced into the loss function. This improves the model's
ability to distinguish between intent classes. Experiments are conducted using
a public natural language understanding dataset. Multiple mainstream models are
used for comparison. Results show that the proposed model outperforms
traditional methods and other deep learning structures in terms of accuracy,
F1-score, and intent detection rate. The study also analyzes the effect of the
number of dynamic routing iterations on model performance. A convergence curve
of the loss function during training is provided. These results verify the
stability and effectiveness of the proposed method in semantic modeling.
Overall, this study presents a new structured modeling approach to improve
intent recognition under complex semantic conditions.

context-specific adjustments. The guidelines are helpful, especially for novice
researchers applying topic modelling, and editors and reviewers handling topic

Conclusion: 该方法具有强通用性和可扩展性，既提升任务适应性，又保留大语言模型的通用能力，适用于复杂语义建模和多语言处理。

Abstract: This paper addresses the limited transfer and adaptation capabilities of
large language models in low-resource language scenarios. It proposes a unified
framework that combines a knowledge transfer module with parameter-efficient
fine-tuning strategies. The method introduces knowledge alignment loss and soft
prompt tuning to guide the model in effectively absorbing the structural
features of target languages or tasks under minimal annotation. This enhances
both generalization performance and training stability. The framework includes
lightweight adaptation modules to reduce computational costs. During training,
it integrates freezing strategies and prompt injection to preserve the model's
original knowledge while enabling quick adaptation to new tasks. The study also
conducts stability analysis experiments and synthetic pseudo-data transfer
experiments to systematically evaluate the method's applicability and
robustness across different low-resource tasks. Experimental results show that
compared with existing multilingual pre-trained models and mainstream transfer
methods, the proposed approach achieves higher performance and stability on
cross-lingual tasks such as MLQA, XQuAD, and PAWS-X. It demonstrates
particularly strong advantages under extremely data-scarce conditions. The
proposed method offers strong generality and scalability. It enhances
task-specific adaptability while preserving the general capabilities of large
language models. This makes it well-suited for complex semantic modeling and
multilingual processing tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in complex tasks through advanced

their reliance on manually crafted, task-specific prompts limits adaptability

that embeds diverse reasoning strategies into LLMs for autonomous,
task-adaptive reasoning without external prompt engineering. MoR has two
phases: Thought Generation, creating reasoning chain templates with models like
GPT-4o, and SFT Dataset Construction, pairing templates with benchmark datasets
for supervised fine-tuning.Our experiments show that MoR significantly enhances
performance, with MoR150 achieving 0.730 (2.2% improvement) using CoT prompting

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a key paradigm for
aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values, yet the reward models
at its core remain largely opaque. In this work, we present sparse Autoencoder
For Enhanced Reward model (\textbf{SAFER}), a novel framework for interpreting

Autoencoders (SAEs), we uncover human-interpretable features in reward model
activations, enabling insight into safety-relevant decision-making. We apply
SAFER to safety-oriented preference datasets and quantify the salience of
individual features by activation differences between chosen and rejected
responses. Using these feature-level signals, we design targeted data poisoning
and denoising strategies. Experiments show that SAFER can precisely degrade or
enhance safety alignment with minimal data modification, without sacrificing
general chat performance. Our approach contributes to interpreting, auditing
and refining reward models in high-stakes LLM alignment tasks. Our codes are

Motivation: 探讨不同文化背景（东亚与西方）对视觉信息处理的差异是否反映在基于不同语言（日语和英语）训练的视觉语言模型中。

Method: 通过对比分析图像描述，研究VLMs是否表现出整体性与分析性倾向的差异。

Result: VLMs不仅内化了语言的结构特性，还再现了训练数据中的文化行为。

Conclusion: 文化认知可能隐式地塑造模型输出，表明文化背景对模型行为有显著影响。

Abstract: Cross-cultural research in perception and cognition has shown that
individuals from different cultural backgrounds process visual information in
distinct ways. East Asians, for example, tend to adopt a holistic perspective,
attending to contextual relationships, whereas Westerners often employ an
analytical approach, focusing on individual objects and their attributes. In
this study, we investigate whether Vision-Language Models (VLMs) trained
predominantly on different languages, specifically Japanese and English,
exhibit similar culturally grounded attentional patterns. Using comparative
analysis of image descriptions, we examine whether these models reflect
differences in holistic versus analytic tendencies. Our findings suggest that
VLMs not only internalize the structural properties of language but also
reproduce cultural behaviors embedded in the training data, indicating that
cultural cognition may implicitly shape model outputs.

highlighting system to categorize information within the generated reports,
differentiating between insights derived directly from time series data,
stemming from financial reasoning, and those reliant on external knowledge.
This approach aids in evaluating the factual grounding and reasoning
capabilities of the models. Our experiments, utilizing both data from the real
stock market indices and synthetic time series, demonstrate the capability of
LLMs to produce coherent and informative financial reports.

*Daniel Fein,Sebastian Russo,Violet Xiang,Kabir Jolly,Rafael Rafailov,Nick Haber*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LitBench是一个标准化基准和数据集，用于评估大语言模型生成的创意写作，通过人类偏好标签和模型训练提升评估可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于开放叙事缺乏真实标准，评估大语言模型生成的创意写作具有挑战性，需要可靠的自动化评估方法。

Method: 引入LitBench，包含人类标注的故事比较数据集，训练Bradley Terry和生成奖励模型，并进行在线人类研究验证。

Result: Claude-3.7-Sonnet是最佳零-shot评估模型（73%人类一致性），训练模型达78%准确性。

Conclusion: LitBench为创意写作系统提供了可靠的自动化评估和优化资源。

Abstract: Evaluating creative writing generated by large language models (LLMs) remains
challenging because open-ended narratives lack ground truths. Without
performant automated evaluation methods, off-the-shelf (OTS) language models
are employed as zero-shot judges, yet their reliability is unclear in this
context. In pursuit of robust evaluation for creative writing, we introduce
LitBench, the first standardized benchmark and paired dataset for creative
writing verification, comprising a held-out test set of 2,480 debiased,
human-labeled story comparisons drawn from Reddit and a 43,827-pair training
corpus of human preference labels. Using LitBench, we (i) benchmark zero-shot
LLM judges, (ii) train Bradley Terry and generative reward models, and (iii)
conduct an online human study to validate reward model rankings on newly
LLM-generated stories. Our benchmark identifies Claude-3.7-Sonnet as the
strongest off-the-shelf judge, reaching 73% agreement with human preferences;
among trained reward models, Bradley-Terry and Generative reward models both
attain an accuracy of 78%, outperforming all off-the-shelf judges. An online
human study further confirms that our trained reward models consistently align
with human preferences in novel LLM-generated stories. We release LitBench and
reward models at
https://huggingface.co/collections/SAA-Lab/litbench-68267b5da3aafe58f9e43461,
providing a vetted resource for reliable, automated evaluation and optimization
of creative writing systems.

TL;DR: 本文回顾了GenAI在科学计量学中的应用，并探讨了其对领域的广泛影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨GenAI在科学计量学中的潜力及其对科学测量方法的影响。

Method: 通过分析GenAI的生成和概率特性，结合其在科学计量学中的实验应用（如主题标注、引用分析等），评估其优缺点。

Result: GenAI在语言生成任务中表现良好，但在需要稳定语义或领域知识的任务中存在局限。

Conclusion: 建议系统比较不同GenAI模型的表现，并强调需通过实证研究和理论反思应对GenAI对科学测量方法的潜在影响。

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to review the use of GenAI in scientometrics, and to
begin a debate on the broader implications for the field. First, we provide an
introduction on GenAI's generative and probabilistic nature as rooted in
distributional linguistics. And we relate this to the debate on the extent to
which GenAI might be able to mimic human 'reasoning'. Second, we leverage this
distinction for a critical engagement with recent experiments using GenAI in
scientometrics, including topic labelling, the analysis of citation contexts,
predictive applications, scholars' profiling, and research assessment. GenAI
shows promise in tasks where language generation dominates, such as labelling,
but faces limitations in tasks that require stable semantics, pragmatic
reasoning, or structured domain knowledge. However, these results might become
quickly outdated. Our recommendation is, therefore, to always strive to
systematically compare the performance of different GenAI models for specific
tasks. Third, we inquire whether, by generating large amounts of scientific
language, GenAI might have a fundamental impact on our field by affecting
textual characteristics used to measure science, such as authors, words, and
references. We argue that careful empirical work and theoretical reflection
will be essential to remain capable of interpreting the evolving patterns of
knowledge production.

Result: LLM在群体中更倾向于接受道德违规，但驱动机制与人类不同。

Conclusion: LLM集体行为的表面模仿与人类不同，对AI对齐和多代理设计有重要意义。

Abstract: Moral judgment is integral to large language model (LLM) alignment and social
reasoning. As multi-agent systems gain prominence, it becomes crucial to
understand how LLMs function collectively during collaboration, compared to
individual agents. In human moral judgment, group deliberation leads to a
utilitarian boost: a tendency to endorse norm violations that maximize benefits
for the greatest number of people despite harms. We study whether a similar
dynamic emerges in multi-agent LLM systems. We tested six models on
well-established sets of moral dilemmas across two conditions: (1) Solo, where
models reasoned independently, and (2) Group, where they engaged in multi-turn
discussions in pairs or triads. In personal moral dilemmas, where agents must
decide to directly harm one individual to maximize the utility for others, all
models found moral violations to be more acceptable when part of a group than
individually, similar to human experiments. Some models endorsed actions that
maximized overall well-being, even if they benefited strangers over familiar
individuals. Others became more willing to violate moral norms in groups.
However, while human groups show a similar action bias, the mechanism for their
utilitarian boost differs from LLMs. Whereas the human shift comes from
heightened sensitivity to decision outcomes, LLM groups show either reduced
norm sensitivity or enhanced impartiality. This suggests that while the surface
behavior of LLM collectives mimics human group reasoning, the underlying
drivers differ. We discuss the implications for AI alignment, multi-agent
design, and artificial moral reasoning.

Method: 设计了一种评估协议，通过人工标注或基于LLM的代理推断类别并应用于其他文档，收集了大量标注数据验证自动化代理。

Result: 发现最佳LLM代理与人类标注者统计上无差异，可作为自动化评估的合理替代。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为实际应用中的主题模型和文档聚类评估提供了可扩展且可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Topic model and document-clustering evaluations either use automated metrics
that align poorly with human preferences or require expert labels that are
intractable to scale. We design a scalable human evaluation protocol and a
corresponding automated approximation that reflect practitioners' real-world
usage of models. Annotators -- or an LLM-based proxy -- review text items
assigned to a topic or cluster, infer a category for the group, then apply that
category to other documents. Using this protocol, we collect extensive
crowdworker annotations of outputs from a diverse set of topic models on two
datasets. We then use these annotations to validate automated proxies, finding
that the best LLM proxies are statistically indistinguishable from a human
annotator and can therefore serve as a reasonable substitute in automated
evaluations. Package, web interface, and data are at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM生成文本的归属、知识产权和伦理问题，探索其写作模式。

Method: 创建基于Wikipedia的基准数据集，使用树模型（决策树和LightGBM）结合文体特征进行分类。

Result: 多分类场景下Matthews相关系数达0.87，二分类准确率0.79-1.0，Wikipedia与GPT-4的平衡数据集准确率达0.98。

Conclusion: 研究表明，对于特定文本类型，可以有效区分机器与人类生成文本。

Abstract: The paper explores stylometry as a method to distinguish between texts
created by Large Language Models (LLMs) and humans, addressing issues of model
attribution, intellectual property, and ethical AI use. Stylometry has been
used extensively to characterise the style and attribute authorship of texts.
By applying it to LLM-generated texts, we identify their emergent writing
patterns. The paper involves creating a benchmark dataset based on Wikipedia,
with (a) human-written term summaries, (b) texts generated purely by LLMs
(GPT-3.5/4, LLaMa 2/3, Orca, and Falcon), (c) processed through multiple text
summarisation methods (T5, BART, Gensim, and Sumy), and (d) rephrasing methods
(Dipper, T5). The 10-sentence long texts were classified by tree-based models
(decision trees and LightGBM) using human-designed (StyloMetrix) and
n-gram-based (our own pipeline) stylometric features that encode lexical,
grammatical, syntactic, and punctuation patterns. The cross-validated results
reached a performance of up to .87 Matthews correlation coefficient in the
multiclass scenario with 7 classes, and accuracy between .79 and 1. in binary
classification, with the particular example of Wikipedia and GPT-4 reaching up
to .98 accuracy on a balanced dataset. Shapley Additive Explanations pinpointed
features characteristic of the encyclopaedic text type, individual overused
words, as well as a greater grammatical standardisation of LLMs with respect to
human-written texts. These results show -- crucially, in the context of the
increasingly sophisticated LLMs -- that it is possible to distinguish machine-
from human-generated texts at least for a well-defined text type.

Motivation: 探索大语言模型（LLMs）在翻译香港法律判决中的潜力，解决法律术语复杂、文化差异和严格语言结构等挑战。

Method: 采用多智能体框架TransLaw，包含翻译、注释和校对三个代理，支持可定制的LLM配置。

Result: TransLaw在语义准确性、结构连贯性和风格保真度上超越GPT-4o，但在复杂术语和风格自然度上仍不及人类专家。

Conclusion: TransLaw为法律翻译提供了一种高效且经济的解决方案，但仍需在术语和风格上进一步优化。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems empowered by large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in a wide range of downstream
applications, including machine translation. However, the potential of LLMs in
translating Hong Kong legal judgments remains uncertain due to challenges such
as intricate legal terminology, culturally embedded nuances, and strict
linguistic structures. In this work, we introduce TransLaw, a novel multi-agent
framework implemented for real-world Hong Kong case law translation. It employs
three specialized agents, namely, Translator, Annotator, and Proofreader, to
collaboratively produce translations for high accuracy in legal meaning,
appropriateness in style, and adequate coherence and cohesion in structure.
This framework supports customizable LLM configurations and achieves tremendous
cost reduction compared to professional human translation services. We
evaluated its performance using 13 open-source and commercial LLMs as agents
and obtained interesting findings, including that it surpasses GPT-4o in legal
semantic accuracy, structural coherence, and stylistic fidelity, yet trails
human experts in contextualizing complex terminology and stylistic naturalness.

used for the evaluation is available at Hugging Face.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数学常被视为文化中立，但问题呈现方式隐含文化背景。现有基准如GSM8K以西方文化为主，本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过提示转换和人工验证，为非洲、印度、中国、韩国和日本创建文化适应版本的GSM8K测试集，并评估六种LLM在五种提示策略下的表现。

Result: 模型在美国中心数据集上表现最佳，文化适应版本表现较差；具备推理能力的模型对文化差异更具韧性。

Conclusion: 深层推理能力有助于弥合数学任务中的文化呈现差异。

Abstract: Although mathematics is often considered culturally neutral, the way
mathematical problems are presented can carry implicit cultural context.
Existing benchmarks like GSM8K are predominantly rooted in Western norms,
including names, currencies, and everyday scenarios. In this work, we create
culturally adapted variants of the GSM8K test set for five regions Africa,
India, China, Korea, and Japan using prompt-based transformations followed by
manual verification. We evaluate six large language models (LLMs), ranging from
8B to 72B parameters, across five prompting strategies to assess their
robustness to cultural variation in math problem presentation. Our findings
reveal a consistent performance gap: models perform best on the original
US-centric dataset and comparatively worse on culturally adapted versions.
However, models with reasoning capabilities are more resilient to these shifts,
suggesting that deeper reasoning helps bridge cultural presentation gaps in
mathematical tasks

Method: 对现有下游扩展定律数据进行元分析，评估线性扩展趋势的普遍性和实验设置的影响。

Result: 仅39%的情况下符合线性扩展趋势，实验设置的微小变化可能显著改变扩展行为。

Conclusion: 需进一步理解扩展定律成功的条件，并关注偏离线性趋势的情况，以全面建模预训练损失与下游任务表现的关系。

Abstract: Downstream scaling laws aim to predict task performance at larger scales from
pretraining losses at smaller scales. Whether this prediction should be
possible is unclear: some works demonstrate that task performance follows clear
linear scaling trends under transformation, whereas others point out
fundamental challenges to downstream scaling laws, such as emergence and
inverse scaling. In this work, we conduct a meta-analysis of existing data on
downstream scaling laws, finding that close fit to linear scaling laws only
occurs in a minority of cases: 39% of the time. Furthermore, seemingly benign
changes to the experimental setting can completely change the scaling trend.
Our analysis underscores the need to understand the conditions under which
scaling laws succeed. To fully model the relationship between pretraining loss
and downstream task performance, we must embrace the cases in which scaling
behavior deviates from linear trends.

Abstract: Memes are widely used in online social interactions, providing vivid,
intuitive, and often humorous means to express intentions and emotions.
Existing dialogue datasets are predominantly limited to either manually
annotated or pure-text conversations, lacking the expressiveness and contextual
nuance that multimodal interactions provide.To address these challenges, we
introduce MemeCMD, an automatically generated Chinese Multi-turn Dialogue
dataset with contextually retrieved memes. Our dataset combines a large-scale,
MLLM-annotated meme library with dialogues auto-generated by dual agents across
diverse scenarios. We introduce a retrieval framework and adaptive threshold to
ensure contextually relevant, naturally spaced meme usage. Experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in generating contextually
appropriate and diverse meme-incorporated dialogues, offering a scalable and
privacy-preserving resource for advancing multimodal conversational AI.

Result: 推断出的系统发育树与已知的金标准树不一致，且从其他多语言资源提取更合适数据的可能性较低。

Conclusion: 当前计算系统发育方法难以直接应用于同源词数据，其应用前景仍存疑。

Abstract: To fully exploit the potential of computational phylogenetic methods for
cognate data one needs to leverage specific (complex) models an machine
learning-based techniques. However, both approaches require datasets that are
substantially larger than the manually collected cognate data currently
available. To the best of our knowledge, there exists no feasible approach to
automatically generate larger cognate datasets. We substantiate this claim by
automatically extracting datasets from BabelNet, a large multilingual
encyclopedic dictionary. We demonstrate that phylogenetic inferences on the
respective character matrices yield trees that are largely inconsistent with
the established gold standard ground truth trees. We also discuss why we
consider it as being unlikely to be able to extract more suitable character
matrices from other multilingual resources. Phylogenetic data analysis
approaches that require larger datasets can therefore not be applied to cognate
data. Thus, it remains an open question how, and if these computational
approaches can be applied in historical linguistics.

Abstract: Moral self-correction has emerged as a promising approach for aligning the
output of Large Language Models (LLMs) with human moral values. However, moral
self-correction techniques are subject to two primary paradoxes. First, despite
empirical and theoretical evidence to support the effectiveness of
self-correction, this LLM capability only operates at a superficial level.
Second, while LLMs possess the capability of self-diagnosing immoral aspects of
their output, they struggle to identify the cause of this moral inconsistency
during their self-correction process. To better understand and address these
paradoxes, we analyze the discourse constructions in fine-tuning corpora
designed to enhance moral self-correction, uncovering the existence of the
heuristics underlying effective constructions. We demonstrate that moral
self-correction relies on discourse constructions that reflect heuristic
shortcuts, and that the presence of these heuristic shortcuts during
self-correction leads to inconsistency when attempting to enhance both
self-correction and self-diagnosis capabilities jointly. Based on our findings,
we propose a solution to improve moral self-correction by leveraging the
heuristics of curated datasets. We also highlight the generalization challenges
of this capability, particularly in terms of learning from situated context and
model scales.

Conclusion: 双阶段训练策略结合CLM和MLM的优势，尤其适合从现有LLM生态中初始化模型，减少计算负担。

Abstract: Learning high-quality text representations is fundamental to a wide range of
NLP tasks. While encoder pretraining has traditionally relied on Masked
Language Modeling (MLM), recent evidence suggests that decoder models
pretrained with Causal Language Modeling (CLM) can be effectively repurposed as
encoders, often surpassing traditional encoders on text representation
benchmarks. However, it remains unclear whether these gains reflect an inherent
advantage of the CLM objective or arise from confounding factors such as model
and data scale. In this paper, we address this question through a series of
large-scale, carefully controlled pretraining ablations, training a total of 30
models ranging from 210 million to 1 billion parameters, and conducting over
15,000 fine-tuning and evaluation runs. We find that while training with MLM
generally yields better performance across text representation tasks,
CLM-trained models are more data-efficient and demonstrate improved fine-tuning
stability. Building on these findings, we experimentally show that a biphasic
training strategy that sequentially applies CLM and then MLM, achieves optimal
performance under a fixed computational training budget. Moreover, we
demonstrate that this strategy becomes more appealing when initializing from
readily available pretrained CLM models (from the existing LLM ecosystem),
reducing the computational burden needed to train best-in-class encoder models.

foundation models and has collected over 13,000 votes from trusted researchers
across diverse scientific domains. We analyze the data collected so far and
confirm that the submitted questions are diverse, aligned with real-world
literature needs, and that participating researchers demonstrate strong
self-consistency and inter-annotator agreement in their evaluations. We discuss
the results and insights based on the model ranking leaderboard. To further
promote research in building model-based automated evaluation systems for
literature tasks, we release SciArena-Eval, a meta-evaluation benchmark based
on our collected preference data. The benchmark measures the accuracy of models
in judging answer quality by comparing their pairwise assessments with human
votes. Our experiments highlight the benchmark's challenges and emphasize the

Conclusion: moment sampling方法显著提升了长视频问答的性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in video large language models (Video LLMs) have
significantly advanced the field of video question answering (VideoQA). While
existing methods perform well on short videos, they often struggle with
long-range reasoning in longer videos. To scale Video LLMs for longer video
content, frame sub-sampling (selecting frames at regular intervals) is commonly
used. However, this approach is suboptimal, often leading to the loss of
crucial frames or the inclusion of redundant information from multiple similar
frames. Missing key frames impairs the model's ability to answer questions
accurately, while redundant frames lead the model to focus on irrelevant video
segments and increase computational resource consumption. In this paper, we
investigate the use of a general-purpose text-to-video moment retrieval model
to guide the frame sampling process. We propose "moment sampling", a novel,
model-agnostic approach that enables the model to select the most relevant
frames according to the context of the question. Specifically, we employ a
lightweight moment retrieval model to prioritize frame selection. By focusing
on the frames most pertinent to the given question, our method enhances
long-form VideoQA performance in Video LLMs. Through extensive experiments on
four long-form VideoQA datasets, using four state-of-the-art Video LLMs, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

TL;DR: 论文提出ER-EMU算法，通过自适应经验回放解决边缘模型在动态交通环境中因灾难性遗忘导致的知识丢失问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态交通环境（如昼夜变化）中，边缘模型在适应新数据分布时会遗忘旧知识，现有方法无法高效利用历史数据。

Method: ER-EMU结合FIFO经验缓冲区和基于域距离度量的经验选择算法（DDM-ES），优先选择与当前目标域差异大的历史数据。

Result: 在Bellevue交通视频数据集上，ER-EMU显著提升了云边协同目标检测框架的性能。

Conclusion: ER-EMU通过优化历史数据选择和缓冲管理，有效缓解灾难性遗忘，提升模型适应性。

Abstract: Continually adapting edge models in cloud-edge collaborative object detection
for traffic monitoring suffers from catastrophic forgetting, where models lose
previously learned knowledge when adapting to new data distributions. This is
especially problematic in dynamic traffic environments characterised by
periodic variations (e.g., day/night, peak hours), where past knowledge remains
valuable. Existing approaches like experience replay and visual prompts offer
some mitigation, but struggle to effectively prioritize and leverage historical
data for optimal knowledge retention and adaptation. Specifically, simply
storing and replaying all historical data can be inefficient, while treating
all historical experiences as equally important overlooks their varying
relevance to the current domain. This paper proposes ER-EMU, an edge model
update algorithm based on adaptive experience replay, to address these
limitations. ER-EMU utilizes a limited-size experience buffer managed using a
First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, and a novel Domain Distance Metric-based
Experience Selection (DDM-ES) algorithm. DDM-ES employs the multi-kernel
maximum mean discrepancy (MK-MMD) to quantify the dissimilarity between target
domains, prioritizing the selection of historical data that is most dissimilar
to the current target domain. This ensures training diversity and facilitates
the retention of knowledge from a wider range of past experiences, while also
preventing overfitting to the new domain. The experience buffer is also updated
using a simple random sampling strategy to maintain a balanced representation
of previous domains. Experiments on the Bellevue traffic video dataset,
involving repeated day/night cycles, demonstrate that ER-EMU consistently
improves the performance of several state-of-the-art cloud-edge collaborative
object detection frameworks.

TL;DR: MR-CLIP是一种多模态对比学习框架，通过对齐MRI图像与DICOM元数据学习对比感知表示，无需依赖人工标签。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI扫描的精确解释依赖于图像对比度的理解，但现有标签（如T1/T2加权）粗糙且元数据常缺失或不完整，阻碍了临床应用。

Method: 提出MR-CLIP框架，利用对比学习对齐图像与元数据，学习对比感知表示，训练数据涵盖多种扫描仪和协议。

Result: MR-CLIP能捕捉对比度变化，支持跨模态检索和对比分类，表现优异且可扩展。

Conclusion: MR-CLIP解决了元数据不可靠问题，为临床工作流和高级应用提供了潜力，代码已开源。

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of Magnetic Resonance Imaging scans in clinical
systems is based on a precise understanding of image contrast. This contrast is
primarily governed by acquisition parameters, such as echo time and repetition
time, which are stored in the DICOM metadata. To simplify contrast
identification, broad labels such as T1-weighted or T2-weighted are commonly
used, but these offer only a coarse approximation of the underlying acquisition
settings. In many real-world datasets, such labels are entirely missing,
leaving raw acquisition parameters as the only indicators of contrast. Adding
to this challenge, the available metadata is often incomplete, noisy, or
inconsistent. The lack of reliable and standardized metadata complicates tasks
such as image interpretation, retrieval, and integration into clinical
workflows. Furthermore, robust contrast-aware representations are essential to
enable more advanced clinical applications, such as achieving
modality-invariant representations and data harmonization. To address these
challenges, we propose MR-CLIP, a multimodal contrastive learning framework
that aligns MR images with their DICOM metadata to learn contrast-aware
representations, without relying on manual labels. Trained on a diverse
clinical dataset that spans various scanners and protocols, MR-CLIP captures
contrast variations across acquisitions and within scans, enabling
anatomy-invariant representations. We demonstrate its effectiveness in
cross-modal retrieval and contrast classification, highlighting its scalability
and potential for further clinical applications. The code and weights are
publicly available at https://github.com/myigitavci/MR-CLIP.

TL;DR: 本文提出并比较了三种检测全切片图像（WSI）中伪影的方法，旨在解决数字化病理学中因伪影导致的图像分析问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在数字化病理学中，WSI广泛用于癌症诊断，但伪影会影响分析准确性，因此需要有效的检测方法。

Method: 提出了三种方法：基于基础模型的FMA、基于ResNet50的DLA和基于手工特征的KBA，用于检测六种常见伪影。

Result: FMA表现最佳（AUROC: 0.995），优于DLA（0.977）和KBA（0.940），并开发了质量报告工具。

Conclusion: FMA在伪影检测中表现最优，为数字化病理学提供了可靠的质量控制工具。

Abstract: In modern cancer diagnostics, Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) is widely used to
digitize tissue specimens for detailed, high-resolution examination; however,
other diagnostic approaches, such as liquid biopsy and molecular testing, are
also utilized based on the cancer type and clinical context. While WSI has
revolutionized digital histopathology by enabling automated, precise analysis,
it remains vulnerable to artifacts introduced during slide preparation and
scanning. These artifacts can compromise downstream image analysis. To address
this challenge, we propose and compare three robust artifact detection
approaches for WSIs: (1) a foundation model-based approach (FMA) using a
fine-tuned Unified Neural Image (UNI) architecture, (2) a deep learning
approach (DLA) built on a ResNet50 backbone, and (3) a knowledge-based approach
(KBA) leveraging handcrafted features from texture, color, and frequency-based
metrics. The methods target six common artifact types: tissue folds,
out-of-focus regions, air bubbles, tissue damage, marker traces, and blood
contamination. Evaluations were conducted on 50,000+ image patches from diverse
scanners (Hamamatsu, Philips, Leica Aperio AT2) across multiple sites. The FMA
achieved the highest patch-wise AUROC of 0.995 (95% CI [0.994, 0.995]),
outperforming the ResNet50-based method (AUROC: 0.977, 95% CI [0.977, 0.978])
and the KBA (AUROC: 0.940, 95% CI [0.933, 0.946]). To translate detection into
actionable insights, we developed a quality report scorecard that quantifies
high-quality patches and visualizes artifact distributions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在多数基准测试中表现优异，但在某些人类专家级任务（如侦探推理）中仍有不足，需更复杂的测试任务以评估其能力。

Method: 通过设计CaughtCheating任务（基于社交媒体中检测伴侣照片可疑线索的场景），对GPT-o3等MLLMs进行实验和分析。

Result: 发现GPT-o3在CaughtCheating任务中表现近乎为零，揭示了现有模型在复杂视觉感知和推理上的不足。

Conclusion: CaughtCheating任务为MLLMs提供了具有实际价值的挑战，成功解决此类任务将推动模型达到人类侦探水平的感知和推理能力。

Abstract: Recent agentic Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) such as GPT-o3 have
achieved near-ceiling scores on various existing benchmarks, motivating a
demand for more challenging test tasks. These MLLMs have been reported to excel
in a few expert-level tasks for humans, e.g., GeoGuesser, reflecting their
potential as a detective who can notice minuscule cues in an image and weave
them into coherent, situational explanations, leading to a reliable answer. But
can they match the performance of excellent human detectives? To answer this
question, we investigate some hard scenarios where GPT-o3 can still handle, and
find a common scenario where o3's performance drops to nearly zero, which we
name CaughtCheating. It is inspired by the social media requests that ask
others to detect suspicious clues from photos shared by the poster's partner.
We conduct extensive experiments and analysis to understand why existing MLLMs
lack sufficient capability to solve this kind of task. CaughtCheating provides
a class of challenging visual perception and reasoning tasks with great value
and practical usage. Success in these tasks paves the way for MLLMs to acquire
human-level detective perception and reasoning capabilities.

Result: PSO自动确定阈值（156-173），多通道可视化成功识别未完全结合区域和不均匀性。

Conclusion: 该方法为AFSD工艺优化和质量评估提供了定量指标。

Abstract: This work proposes an evolutionary computing-based image segmentation
approach for analyzing soundness in Additive Friction Stir Deposition (AFSD)
processes. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) was employed to determine optimal
segmentation thresholds for detecting defects and features in multilayer AFSD
builds. The methodology integrates gradient magnitude analysis with distance
transforms to create novel attention-weighted visualizations that highlight
critical interface regions. Five AFSD samples processed under different
conditions were analyzed using multiple visualization techniques i.e.
self-attention maps, and multi-channel visualization. These complementary
approaches reveal subtle material transition zones and potential defect regions
which were not readily observable through conventional imaging. The PSO
algorithm automatically identified optimal threshold values (ranging from
156-173) for each sample, enabling precise segmentation of material interfaces.
The multi-channel visualization technique effectively combines boundary
information (red channel), spatial relationships (green channel), and material
density data (blue channel) into cohesive representations that quantify
interface quality. The results demonstrate that attention-based analysis
successfully identifies regions of incomplete bonding and inhomogeneities in
AFSD joints, providing quantitative metrics for process optimization and
quality assessment of additively manufactured components.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模数据集的冗余和计算负担挑战机器学习模型训练，现有剪枝方法存在任务无关性或计算成本高的问题。

Method: AdaDeDup先分区并进行密度剪枝，再用代理模型评估剪枝效果，自适应调整阈值。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，AdaDeDup显著优于基线方法，减少性能下降，剪枝20%数据仍接近原始性能。

Conclusion: AdaDeDup有效提升大规模模型训练的数据效率，代码已开源。

Abstract: The computational burden and inherent redundancy of large-scale datasets
challenge the training of contemporary machine learning models. Data pruning
offers a solution by selecting smaller, informative subsets, yet existing
methods struggle: density-based approaches can be task-agnostic, while
model-based techniques may introduce redundancy or prove computationally
prohibitive. We introduce Adaptive De-Duplication (AdaDeDup), a novel hybrid
framework that synergistically integrates density-based pruning with
model-informed feedback in a cluster-adaptive manner. AdaDeDup first partitions
data and applies an initial density-based pruning. It then employs a proxy
model to evaluate the impact of this initial pruning within each cluster by
comparing losses on kept versus pruned samples. This task-aware signal
adaptively adjusts cluster-specific pruning thresholds, enabling more
aggressive pruning in redundant clusters while preserving critical data in
informative ones. Extensive experiments on large-scale object detection
benchmarks (Waymo, COCO, nuScenes) using standard models (BEVFormer, Faster
R-CNN) demonstrate AdaDeDup's advantages. It significantly outperforms
prominent baselines, substantially reduces performance degradation (e.g., over
54% versus random sampling on Waymo), and achieves near-original model
performance while pruning 20% of data, highlighting its efficacy in enhancing
data efficiency for large-scale model training. Code is open-sourced.

Motivation: 医疗VLM在临床应用中潜力巨大，但缺乏系统性的安全性评估，因此需要开发一个标准化框架来识别和量化其漏洞。

Method: VSF-Med整合了三种新组件：文本攻击模板库、基于SSIM的视觉扰动和八维评分标准，并通过z-score归一化生成综合风险指标。

Result: 在30,000个对抗样本测试中，VSF-Med显示主流VLM在攻击持续性、提示注入和安全性绕过方面存在显著漏洞，如Llama-3.2-11B和GPT-4o的z-score变化明显。

Conclusion: VSF-Med为医疗VLM的安全性评估提供了标准化工具，揭示了现有模型的潜在风险，并支持可复现的基准测试。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) hold great promise for streamlining
labour-intensive medical imaging workflows, yet systematic security evaluations
in clinical settings remain scarce. We introduce VSF--Med, an end-to-end
vulnerability-scoring framework for medical VLMs that unites three novel
components: (i) a rich library of sophisticated text-prompt attack templates
targeting emerging threat vectors; (ii) imperceptible visual perturbations
calibrated by structural similarity (SSIM) thresholds to preserve clinical
realism; and (iii) an eight-dimensional rubric evaluated by two independent
judge LLMs, whose raw scores are consolidated via z-score normalization to
yield a 0--32 composite risk metric. Built entirely on publicly available
datasets and accompanied by open-source code, VSF--Med synthesizes over 30,000
adversarial variants from 5,000 radiology images and enables reproducible
benchmarking of any medical VLM with a single command. Our consolidated
analysis reports mean z-score shifts of $0.90\sigma$ for
persistence-of-attack-effects, $0.74\sigma$ for prompt-injection effectiveness,
and $0.63\sigma$ for safety-bypass success across state-of-the-art VLMs.
Notably, Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct exhibits a peak vulnerability increase
of $1.29\sigma$ for persistence-of-attack-effects, while GPT-4o shows increases
of $0.69\sigma$ for that same vector and $0.28\sigma$ for prompt-injection
attacks.

Motivation: 当前多模态学习方法通常将不同模态分开处理，导致表示和推理的不一致性。MANTA旨在通过统一的文本空间解决这一问题。

Method: MANTA采用信息论优化实现跨模态语义对齐，自适应时间同步，分层内容表示和上下文感知检索，并通过数学框架证明其最优性。

Conclusion: MANTA通过新颖的密度估计技术最小化冗余并保留稀有信号，为多模态表示的统一提供了新基础。

Abstract: While multi-modal learning has advanced significantly, current approaches
often treat modalities separately, creating inconsistencies in representation
and reasoning. We introduce MANTA (Multi-modal Abstraction and Normalization
via Textual Alignment), a theoretically-grounded framework that unifies visual
and auditory inputs into a structured textual space for seamless processing
with large language models. MANTA addresses four key challenges: (1) semantic
alignment across modalities with information-theoretic optimization, (2)
adaptive temporal synchronization for varying information densities, (3)
hierarchical content representation for multi-scale understanding, and (4)
context-aware retrieval of sparse information from long sequences. We formalize
our approach within a rigorous mathematical framework, proving its optimality
for context selection under token constraints. Extensive experiments on the
challenging task of Long Video Question Answering show that MANTA improves
state-of-the-art models by up to 22.6% in overall accuracy, with particularly
significant gains (27.3%) on videos exceeding 30 minutes. Additionally, we
demonstrate MANTA's superiority on temporal reasoning tasks (23.8% improvement)
and cross-modal understanding (25.1% improvement). Our framework introduces
novel density estimation techniques for redundancy minimization while
preserving rare signals, establishing new foundations for unifying multimodal
representations through structured text.

Abstract: Plant diseases pose significant challenges to farmers and the agricultural
sector at large. However, early detection of plant diseases is crucial to
mitigating their effects and preventing widespread damage, as outbreaks can
severely impact the productivity and quality of crops. With advancements in
technology, there are increasing opportunities for automating the monitoring
and detection of disease outbreaks in plants. This study proposed a system
designed to identify and monitor plant diseases using a transfer learning
approach. Specifically, the study utilizes YOLOv7 and YOLOv8, two
state-ofthe-art models in the field of object detection. By fine-tuning these
models on a dataset of plant leaf images, the system is able to accurately
detect the presence of Bacteria, Fungi and Viral diseases such as Powdery
Mildew, Angular Leaf Spot, Early blight and Tomato mosaic virus. The model's
performance was evaluated using several metrics, including mean Average
Precision (mAP), F1-score, Precision, and Recall, yielding values of 91.05,
89.40, 91.22, and 87.66, respectively. The result demonstrates the superior
effectiveness and efficiency of YOLOv8 compared to other object detection

The approach provides a scalable, automated solution for early any plant

manual monitoring, and supporting sustainable agricultural practices.

Conclusion: 扩散基图像增强方法可扩展至雪地以外的多种环境，如沙地和火山地形。

Abstract: The performance of leaning-based perception algorithms suffer when deployed
in out-of-distribution and underrepresented environments. Outdoor robots are
particularly susceptible to rapid changes in visual scene appearance due to
dynamic lighting, seasonality and weather effects that lead to scenes
underrepresented in the training data of the learning-based perception system.
In this conceptual paper, we focus on preparing our autonomous vehicle for
deployment in snow-filled environments. We propose a novel method for
diffusion-based image augmentation to more closely represent the deployment
environment in our training data. Diffusion-based image augmentations rely on
the public availability of vision foundation models learned on internet-scale
datasets. The diffusion-based image augmentations allow us to take control over
the semantic distribution of the ground surfaces in the training data and to
fine-tune our model for its deployment environment. We employ open vocabulary
semantic segmentation models to filter out augmentation candidates that contain
hallucinations. We believe that diffusion-based image augmentations can be
extended to many other environments apart from snow surfaces, like sandy
environments and volcanic terrains.

Conclusion: FreeLong++为长视频生成提供了一种高效且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation models have enabled high-quality short
video generation from text prompts. However, extending these models to longer
videos remains a significant challenge, primarily due to degraded temporal
consistency and visual fidelity. Our preliminary observations show that naively
applying short-video generation models to longer sequences leads to noticeable
quality degradation. Further analysis identifies a systematic trend where
high-frequency components become increasingly distorted as video length grows,
an issue we term high-frequency distortion. To address this, we propose
FreeLong, a training-free framework designed to balance the frequency
distribution of long video features during the denoising process. FreeLong
achieves this by blending global low-frequency features, which capture holistic
semantics across the full video, with local high-frequency features extracted
from short temporal windows to preserve fine details. Building on this,
FreeLong++ extends FreeLong dual-branch design into a multi-branch architecture
with multiple attention branches, each operating at a distinct temporal scale.
By arranging multiple window sizes from global to local, FreeLong++ enables
multi-band frequency fusion from low to high frequencies, ensuring both
semantic continuity and fine-grained motion dynamics across longer video
sequences. Without any additional training, FreeLong++ can be plugged into
existing video generation models (e.g. Wan2.1 and LTX-Video) to produce longer
videos with substantially improved temporal consistency and visual fidelity. We
demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous methods on longer video
generation tasks (e.g. 4x and 8x of native length). It also supports coherent
multi-prompt video generation with smooth scene transitions and enables
controllable video generation using long depth or pose sequences.

Abstract: Detecting individual tree crowns in tropical forests is essential to study
these complex and crucial ecosystems impacted by human interventions and
climate change. However, tropical crowns vary widely in size, structure, and
pattern and are largely overlapping and intertwined, requiring advanced remote
sensing methods applied to high-resolution imagery. Despite growing interest in
tropical tree crown detection, annotated datasets remain scarce, hindering
robust model development. We introduce SelvaBox, the largest open-access
dataset for tropical tree crown detection in high-resolution drone imagery. It
spans three countries and contains more than 83,000 manually labeled crowns -
an order of magnitude larger than all previous tropical forest datasets
combined. Extensive benchmarks on SelvaBox reveal two key findings: (1)
higher-resolution inputs consistently boost detection accuracy; and (2) models
trained exclusively on SelvaBox achieve competitive zero-shot detection
performance on unseen tropical tree crown datasets, matching or exceeding
competing methods. Furthermore, jointly training on SelvaBox and three other
datasets at resolutions from 3 to 10 cm per pixel within a unified
multi-resolution pipeline yields a detector ranking first or second across all
evaluated datasets. Our dataset, code, and pre-trained weights are made public.

Abstract: In precision agriculture, one of the most important tasks when exploring crop
production is identifying individual plant components. There are several
attempts to accomplish this task by the use of traditional 2D imaging, 3D
reconstructions, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). However, they have
several drawbacks when processing 3D data and identifying individual plant
components. Therefore, in this work, we propose a novel Deep Learning
architecture to detect components of individual plants on Light Detection and
Ranging (LiDAR) 3D Point Cloud (PC) data sets. This architecture is based on
the concept of Graph Neural Networks (GNN), and feature enhancing with
Principal Component Analysis (PCA). For this, each point is taken as a vertex
and by the use of a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) layer, the edges are established,
thus representing the 3D PC data set. Subsequently, Edge-Conv layers are used
to further increase the features of each point. Finally, Graph Attention
Networks (GAT) are applied to classify visible phenotypic components of the
plant, such as the leaf, stem, and soil. This study demonstrates that our

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统在协作任务中难以准确捕捉学生与物理对象的交互，6D姿态估计可解决这一问题。

Method: 提出FiboSB数据集，评估四种6D姿态估计方法，并改进YOLO11-x。

Result: 改进后的YOLO11-x在FiboSB上达到mAP_50为0.898。

Conclusion: FiboSB数据集和YOLO11-x的改进为协作场景中的6D姿态估计奠定了基础。

Abstract: Interactive and spatially aware technologies are transforming educational
frameworks, particularly in K-12 settings where hands-on exploration fosters
deeper conceptual understanding. However, during collaborative tasks, existing
systems often lack the ability to accurately capture real-world interactions
between students and physical objects. This issue could be addressed with
automatic 6D pose estimation, i.e., estimation of an object's position and
orientation in 3D space from RGB images or videos. For collaborative groups
that interact with physical objects, 6D pose estimates allow AI systems to
relate objects and entities. As part of this work, we introduce FiboSB, a novel
and challenging 6D pose video dataset featuring groups of three participants
solving an interactive task featuring small hand-held cubes and a weight scale.
This setup poses unique challenges for 6D pose because groups are holistically
recorded from a distance in order to capture all participants -- this, coupled
with the small size of the cubes, makes 6D pose estimation inherently
non-trivial. We evaluated four state-of-the-art 6D pose estimation methods on
FiboSB, exposing the limitations of current algorithms on collaborative group
work. An error analysis of these methods reveals that the 6D pose methods'
object detection modules fail. We address this by fine-tuning YOLO11-x for
FiboSB, achieving an overall mAP_50 of 0.898. The dataset, benchmark results,
and analysis of YOLO11-x errors presented here lay the groundwork for
leveraging the estimation of 6D poses in difficult collaborative contexts.

TL;DR: VOCAL是一种基于对比学习的视觉里程计框架，通过贝叶斯推理和表示学习提升特征可解释性和多模态兼容性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学习型视觉里程计方法依赖刚性几何假设，缺乏可解释性和理论支持，VOCAL旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 将视觉里程计重新定义为标签排序问题，结合贝叶斯推理和表示学习，使视觉特征与相机状态对齐。

Result: 在KITTI数据集上验证，VOCAL表现出更高的可解释性和灵活性。

Conclusion: VOCAL推动了视觉里程计向更通用、可解释的空间智能发展。

Abstract: Breakthroughs in visual odometry (VO) have fundamentally reshaped the
landscape of robotics, enabling ultra-precise camera state estimation that is
crucial for modern autonomous systems. Despite these advances, many
learning-based VO techniques rely on rigid geometric assumptions, which often
fall short in interpretability and lack a solid theoretical basis within fully
data-driven frameworks. To overcome these limitations, we introduce VOCAL
(Visual Odometry via ContrAstive Learning), a novel framework that reimagines
VO as a label ranking challenge. By integrating Bayesian inference with a
representation learning framework, VOCAL organizes visual features to mirror
camera states. The ranking mechanism compels similar camera states to converge
into consistent and spatially coherent representations within the latent space.
This strategic alignment not only bolsters the interpretability of the learned
features but also ensures compatibility with multimodal data sources. Extensive
evaluations on the KITTI dataset highlight VOCAL's enhanced interpretability
and flexibility, pushing VO toward more general and explainable spatial
intelligence.

in sign language recognition, including data scarcity, high computational
costs, and discrepancies in frame rates between training and inference
environments. By encoding sign language specific parameters, such as handshape,

TL;DR: 提出GazeTarget360系统，用于从图像中估计360度视线目标，适用于真实场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人理解人类视线目标是实现注意力估计和动作预测等任务的关键，现有方法无法有效处理视线离开相机的情况。

Method: 结合条件推理引擎（包括眼接触检测器、预训练视觉编码器和多尺度融合解码器）构建GazeTarget360系统。

Result: 交叉验证显示，系统在未见场景中能准确预测视线目标，高效且可部署。

Conclusion: GazeTarget360是首个能从真实相机画面预测视线目标的系统，代码已开源。

Abstract: Enabling robots to understand human gaze target is a crucial step to allow
capabilities in downstream tasks, for example, attention estimation and
movement anticipation in real-world human-robot interactions. Prior works have
addressed the in-frame target localization problem with data-driven approaches
by carefully removing out-of-frame samples. Vision-based gaze estimation
methods, such as OpenFace, do not effectively absorb background information in
images and cannot predict gaze target in situations where subjects look away
from the camera. In this work, we propose a system to address the problem of
360-degree gaze target estimation from an image in generalized visual scenes.
The system, named GazeTarget360, integrates conditional inference engines of an
eye-contact detector, a pre-trained vision encoder, and a multi-scale-fusion
decoder. Cross validation results show that GazeTarget360 can produce accurate
and reliable gaze target predictions in unseen scenarios. This makes a
first-of-its-kind system to predict gaze targets from realistic camera footage
which is highly efficient and deployable. Our source code is made publicly

Result: 系统能自我对战、与真实击剑手动作对战，并与专业击剑手互动。

Conclusion: VirtualFencer展示了数据驱动建模在击剑中的潜力。

Abstract: Fencing is a sport where athletes engage in diverse yet strategically logical
motions. While most motions fall into a few high-level actions (e.g. step,
lunge, parry), the execution can vary widely-fast vs. slow, large vs. small,
offensive vs. defensive. Moreover, a fencer's actions are informed by a
strategy that often comes in response to the opponent's behavior. This
combination of motion diversity with underlying two-player strategy motivates
the application of data-driven modeling to fencing. We present VirtualFencer, a
system capable of extracting 3D fencing motion and strategy from in-the-wild
video without supervision, and then using that extracted knowledge to generate
realistic fencing behavior. We demonstrate the versatile capabilities of our
system by having it (i) fence against itself (self-play), (ii) fence against a
real fencer's motion from online video, and (iii) fence interactively against a
professional fencer.

Conclusion: 该方法在实时和数据稀缺环境下高效，有助于旅行者理解房产布局和睡眠配置。

Abstract: The rapid growth of vacation rental (VR) platforms has led to an increasing
volume of property images, often uploaded without structured categorization.
This lack of organization poses significant challenges for travelers attempting
to understand the spatial layout of a property, particularly when multiple
rooms of the same type are present. To address this issue, we introduce an
effective approach for solving the room scene discovery and grouping problem,
as well as identifying bed types within each bedroom group. This grouping is
valuable for travelers to comprehend the spatial organization, layout, and the
sleeping configuration of the property. We propose a computationally efficient
machine learning pipeline characterized by low latency and the ability to
perform effectively with sample-efficient learning, making it well-suited for
real-time and data-scarce environments. The pipeline integrates a supervised
room-type detection model, a supervised overlap detection model to identify the
overlap similarity between two images, and a clustering algorithm to group the
images of the same space together using the similarity scores. Additionally,
the pipeline maps each bedroom group to the corresponding bed types specified
in the property's metadata, based on the visual content present in the group's
images using a Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) model. We evaluate the
aforementioned models individually and also assess the pipeline in its
entirety, observing strong performance that significantly outperforms
established approaches such as contrastive learning and clustering with
pretrained embeddings.

Motivation: 当前AI方法在多视图X射线分析中难以建立稳健的对应关系，而这对临床诊断至关重要。

Result: 在合成和真实X射线数据上验证，多视图对应关系显著提升了骨折分类性能。

Conclusion: 自监督学习多视图对应关系可作为预训练策略，有效提升真实数据上的骨折检测效果。

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of multi-view radiographs is crucial for diagnosing
fractures, muscular injuries, and other anomalies. While significant advances
have been made in AI-based analysis of single images, current methods often
struggle to establish robust correspondences between different X-ray views, an
essential capability for precise clinical evaluations. In this work, we present
a novel self-supervised pipeline that eliminates the need for manual annotation
by automatically generating a many-to-many correspondence matrix between
synthetic X-ray views. This is achieved using digitally reconstructed
radiographs (DRR), which are automatically derived from unannotated CT volumes.
Our approach incorporates a transformer-based training phase to accurately
predict correspondences across two or more X-ray views. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that learning correspondences among synthetic X-ray views can be
leveraged as a pretraining strategy to enhance automatic multi-view fracture
detection on real data. Extensive evaluations on both synthetic and real X-ray
datasets show that incorporating correspondences improves performance in
multi-view fracture classification.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多保真度模型融合策略，以减少多实例学习（MIL）方法在数字病理学中的性能波动，并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字病理学中的全切片图像（WSI）分类存在性能波动大的问题，主要源于权重初始化、批次排序和学习率等因素。

Method: 通过训练多个模型并基于验证分数平均最稳定和有前景的模型，以减少性能波动。

Result: 在两种数据集、三种初始化策略和五种MIL方法上进行了超过2000次实验，验证了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够降低性能波动，简化超参数调优，提高可重复性，同时保持计算效率。

Abstract: Digital pathology has revolutionized the field by enabling the digitization
of tissue samples into whole slide images (WSIs). However, the high resolution
and large size of WSIs present significant challenges when it comes to applying
Deep Learning models. As a solution, WSIs are often divided into smaller
patches with a global label (\textit{i.e., diagnostic}) per slide, instead of a
(too) costly pixel-wise annotation. By treating each slide as a bag of patches,
Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) methods have emerged as a suitable solution
for WSI classification. A major drawback of MIL methods is their high
variability in performance across different runs, which can reach up to 10-15
AUC points on the test set, making it difficult to compare different MIL
methods reliably. This variability mainly comes from three factors: i) weight
initialization, ii) batch (shuffling) ordering, iii) and learning rate. To
address that, we introduce a Multi-Fidelity, Model Fusion strategy for MIL
methods. We first train multiple models for a few epochs and average the most
stable and promising ones based on validation scores. This approach can be
applied to any existing MIL model to reduce performance variability. It also
simplifies hyperparameter tuning and improves reproducibility while maintaining
computational efficiency. We extensively validate our approach on WSI
classification tasks using 2 different datasets, 3 initialization strategies
and 5 MIL methods, for a total of more than 2000 experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决固定低秩结构在领域差距大的场景中适应性不足的问题，同时避免现有自适应LoRA方法的高计算成本。

Method: 提出SR-LoRA框架，利用预训练权重矩阵的稳定秩指导层间秩分配，无需额外搜索或正则化。

Result: 在领域差距大的少样本任务中，SR-LoRA表现优于现有自适应LoRA方法，性能与效率更优。

Conclusion: SR-LoRA通过稳定秩指导的秩分配，实现了高效且适应性强的低秩自适应。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has proven effective in reducing computational
costs while maintaining performance comparable to fully fine-tuned foundation
models across various tasks. However, its fixed low-rank structure restricts
its adaptability in scenarios with substantial domain gaps, where higher ranks
are often required to capture domain-specific complexities. Current adaptive
LoRA methods attempt to overcome this limitation by dynamically expanding or
selectively allocating ranks, but these approaches frequently depend on
computationally intensive techniques such as iterative pruning, rank searches,
or additional regularization. To address these challenges, we introduce Stable
Rank-Guided Low-Rank Adaptation (SR-LoRA), a novel framework that utilizes the
stable rank of pre-trained weight matrices as a natural prior for layer-wise
rank allocation. By leveraging the stable rank, which reflects the intrinsic
dimensionality of the weights, SR-LoRA enables a principled and efficient
redistribution of ranks across layers, enhancing adaptability without incurring
additional search costs. Empirical evaluations on few-shot tasks with
significant domain gaps show that SR-LoRA consistently outperforms recent
adaptive LoRA variants, achieving a superior trade-off between performance and
efficiency. Our code is available at

Abstract: Accurate lesion tracking in temporal mammograms is essential for monitoring
breast cancer progression and facilitating early diagnosis. However, automated
lesion correspondence across exams remains a challenges in computer-aided
diagnosis (CAD) systems, limiting their effectiveness. We propose MammoTracker,
a mask-guided lesion tracking framework that automates lesion localization
across consecutively exams. Our approach follows a coarse-to-fine strategy
incorporating three key modules: global search, local search, and score
refinement. To support large-scale training and evaluation, we introduce a new
dataset with curated prior-exam annotations for 730 mass and calcification
cases from the public EMBED mammogram dataset, yielding over 20000 lesion
pairs, making it the largest known resource for temporal lesion tracking in
mammograms. Experimental results demonstrate that MammoTracker achieves 0.455
average overlap and 0.509 accuracy, surpassing baseline models by 8%,
highlighting its potential to enhance CAD-based lesion progression analysis.

Abstract: Can a video generation model be repurposed as an interactive world simulator?
We explore the affordance perception potential of text-to-video models by
teaching them to predict human-environment interaction. Given a scene image and
a prompt describing human actions, we fine-tune the model to insert a person
into the scene, while ensuring coherent behavior, appearance, harmonization,
and scene affordance. Unlike prior work, we infer human affordance for video
generation (i.e., where to insert a person and how they should behave) from a
single scene image, without explicit conditions like bounding boxes or body
poses. An in-depth study of cross-attention heatmaps demonstrates that we can
uncover the inherent affordance perception of a pre-trained video model without
labeled affordance datasets.

Conclusion: MOVi-MC-AC填补了多摄像头模态数据集的空白，为计算机视觉研究提供了新资源。

Abstract: Amodal segmentation and amodal content completion require using object priors
to estimate occluded masks and features of objects in complex scenes. Until
now, no data has provided an additional dimension for object context: the
possibility of multiple cameras sharing a view of a scene. We introduce
MOVi-MC-AC: Multiple Object Video with Multi-Cameras and Amodal Content, the
largest amodal segmentation and first amodal content dataset to date. Cluttered
scenes of generic household objects are simulated in multi-camera video.
MOVi-MC-AC contributes to the growing literature of object detection, tracking,
and segmentation by including two new contributions to the deep learning for
computer vision world. Multiple Camera (MC) settings where objects can be
identified and tracked between various unique camera perspectives are rare in
both synthetic and real-world video. We introduce a new complexity to synthetic
video by providing consistent object ids for detections and segmentations
between both frames and multiple cameras each with unique features and motion
patterns on a single scene. Amodal Content (AC) is a reconstructive task in
which models predict the appearance of target objects through occlusions. In
the amodal segmentation literature, some datasets have been released with
amodal detection, tracking, and segmentation labels. While other methods rely
on slow cut-and-paste schemes to generate amodal content pseudo-labels, they do
not account for natural occlusions present in the modal masks. MOVi-MC-AC
provides labels for ~5.8 million object instances, setting a new maximum in the
amodal dataset literature, along with being the first to provide ground-truth
amodal content. The full dataset is available at

Motivation: 尽管深度学习在遥感领域取得了进展，但超高分辨率光学遥感影像的获取渠道有限，限制了高分辨率遥感视觉基础模型的发展。吉林一号卫星作为全球最大的亚米级商业遥感卫星星座，提供了丰富的资源。

Method: 研究设计了CGEarthEye框架，包含五个不同参数规模的骨干网络（总计21亿参数），并开发了JLSSD数据集（1500万规模的多时相自监督学习数据集）。预训练结合了季节性对比、增强对比和掩码补丁标记对比策略。

Conclusion: CGEarthEye的卓越表征能力有望推动吉林一号数据在传统地球观测应用中的更广泛和高效应用。

Abstract: Deep learning methods have significantly advanced the development of
intelligent rinterpretation in remote sensing (RS), with foundational model
research based on large-scale pre-training paradigms rapidly reshaping various
domains of Earth Observation (EO). However, compared to the open accessibility
and high spatiotemporal coverage of medium-resolution data, the limited
acquisition channels for ultra-high-resolution optical RS imagery have
constrained the progress of high-resolution remote sensing vision foundation
models (RSVFM). As the world's largest sub-meter-level commercial RS satellite
constellation, the Jilin-1 constellation possesses abundant sub-meter-level
image resources. This study proposes CGEarthEye, a RSVFM framework specifically
designed for Jilin-1 satellite characteristics, comprising five backbones with
different parameter scales with totaling 2.1 billion parameters. To enhance the
representational capacity of the foundation model, we developed JLSSD, the
first 15-million-scale multi-temporal self-supervised learning (SSL) dataset
featuring global coverage with quarterly temporal sampling within a single
year, constructed through multi-level representation clustering and sampling
strategies. The framework integrates seasonal contrast, augmentation-based
contrast, and masked patch token contrastive strategies for pre-training.
Comprehensive evaluations across 10 benchmark datasets covering four typical RS
tasks demonstrate that the CGEarthEye consistently achieves state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance. Further analysis reveals CGEarthEye's superior
characteristics in feature visualization, model convergence, parameter
efficiency, and practical mapping applications. This study anticipates that the
exceptional representation capabilities of CGEarthEye will facilitate broader
and more efficient applications of Jilin-1 data in traditional EO application.

Abstract: We propose a method to enhance 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)~\cite{Kerbl2023},
addressing challenges in initialization, optimization, and density control.
Gaussian Splatting is an alternative for rendering realistic images while
supporting real-time performance, and it has gained popularity due to its
explicit 3D Gaussian representation. However, 3DGS heavily depends on accurate
initialization and faces difficulties in optimizing unstructured Gaussian
distributions into ordered surfaces, with limited adaptive density control
mechanism proposed so far. Our first key contribution is a geometry-guided
initialization to predict Gaussian parameters, ensuring precise placement and
faster convergence. We then introduce a surface-aligned optimization strategy
to refine Gaussian placement, improving geometric accuracy and aligning with
the surface normals of the scene. Finally, we present a dynamic adaptive
density control mechanism that adjusts Gaussian density based on regional
complexity, for visual fidelity. These innovations enable our method to achieve
high-fidelity real-time rendering and significant improvements in visual
quality, even in complex scenes. Our method demonstrates comparable or superior
results to state-of-the-art methods, rendering high-fidelity images in real
time.

Motivation: 手写签名在身份识别中具有法律效力和独特性，但签名样本常受干扰信息影响，给识别工作带来挑战。

Method: 采用改进的U-net结构，结合离散小波变换和PCA变换，提升去噪能力。

Result: 实验表明，该模型去噪效果显著优于传统方法，提高了签名图像的清晰度和可读性。

Conclusion: 该模型为签名分析和识别提供了更可靠的技术支持。

Abstract: Handwriting signatures, as an important means of identity recognition, are
widely used in multiple fields such as financial transactions, commercial
contracts and personal affairs due to their legal effect and uniqueness. In
forensic science appraisals, the analysis of offline handwriting signatures
requires the appraiser to provide a certain number of signature samples, which
are usually derived from various historical contracts or archival materials.
However, the provided handwriting samples are often mixed with a large amount
of interfering information, which brings severe challenges to handwriting
identification work. This study proposes a signature handwriting denoising
model based on the improved U-net structure, aiming to enhance the robustness
of the signature recognition system. By introducing discrete wavelet transform
and PCA transform, the model's ability to suppress noise has been enhanced. The
experimental results show that this modelis significantly superior to the
traditional methods in denoising effect, can effectively improve the clarity
and readability of the signed images, and provide more reliable technical

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ATLI的新方法，通过自适应选择有效的top-k logits并结合最大logit，显著提升了OOD检测性能，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络对分布外（OOD）样本的预测往往过于自信，检测OOD数据对提升机器学习安全性至关重要。

Method: 提出ATLI方法，自适应确定模型特定的有效top-k logits，并将其与最大logit结合用于OOD检测。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K基准测试中，ATLI将FPR95降低了6.73%（相比MaxLogit）和2.67%（相比其他先进方法）。

Conclusion: ATLI通过利用更多logit信息，显著提升了OOD检测性能，为机器学习安全性提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Neural networks often make overconfident predictions from out-of-distribution
(OOD) samples. Detection of OOD data is therefore crucial to improve the safety
of machine learning. The simplest and most powerful method for OOD detection is
MaxLogit, which uses the model's maximum logit to provide an OOD score. We have
discovered that, in addition to the maximum logit, some other logits are also
useful for OOD detection. Based on this finding, we propose a new method called
ATLI (Adaptive Top-k Logits Integration), which adaptively determines effective
top-k logits that are specific to each model and combines the maximum logit
with the other top-k logits. In this study we evaluate our proposed method
using ImageNet-1K benchmark. Extensive experiments showed our proposed method
to reduce the false positive rate (FPR95) by 6.73% compared to the MaxLogit
approach, and decreased FPR95 by an additional 2.67% compared to other
state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有植物点云器官分割技术在分辨率、精度和跨物种通用性方面存在局限，需要一种更高效、高精度的解决方案。

Method: PlantSegNeRF结合2D实例分割、实例匹配模块和实例NeRF，从多视角图像生成包含颜色、密度、语义和实例信息的隐式场景，最终转换为高精度点云。

Result: 在语义分割和实例分割任务中，PlantSegNeRF表现优异，各项指标平均提升显著，尤其在复杂数据集上优势明显。

Conclusion: PlantSegNeRF为植物器官级表型分析提供了高通量方法，并为植物科学大规模模型开发提供了高质量3D数据支持。

Abstract: Organ segmentation of plant point clouds is a prerequisite for the
high-resolution and accurate extraction of organ-level phenotypic traits.
Although the fast development of deep learning has boosted much research on
segmentation of plant point clouds, the existing techniques for organ
segmentation still face limitations in resolution, segmentation accuracy, and
generalizability across various plant species. In this study, we proposed a
novel approach called plant segmentation neural radiance fields (PlantSegNeRF),
aiming to directly generate high-precision instance point clouds from
multi-view RGB image sequences for a wide range of plant species. PlantSegNeRF
performed 2D instance segmentation on the multi-view images to generate
instance masks for each organ with a corresponding ID. The multi-view instance
IDs corresponding to the same plant organ were then matched and refined using a
specially designed instance matching module. The instance NeRF was developed to
render an implicit scene, containing color, density, semantic and instance
information. The implicit scene was ultimately converted into high-precision
plant instance point clouds based on the volume density. The results proved
that in semantic segmentation of point clouds, PlantSegNeRF outperformed the
commonly used methods, demonstrating an average improvement of 16.1%, 18.3%,
17.8%, and 24.2% in precision, recall, F1-score, and IoU compared to the
second-best results on structurally complex datasets. More importantly,
PlantSegNeRF exhibited significant advantages in plant point cloud instance
segmentation tasks. Across all plant datasets, it achieved average improvements
of 11.7%, 38.2%, 32.2% and 25.3% in mPrec, mRec, mCov, mWCov, respectively.
This study extends the organ-level plant phenotyping and provides a
high-throughput way to supply high-quality 3D data for the development of
large-scale models in plant science.

TL;DR: 提出一种高效、可扩展的数据集合成方法，解决大光圈相机因浅景深导致的模糊问题，无需依赖真实数据微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大光圈相机因浅景深导致图像模糊，尤其是固定焦距相机（如智能眼镜）难以添加自动对焦机制，现有深度学习模型因域差距在真实场景中表现不佳。

Method: 同时建模深度相关散焦和空间变化光学像差，解决计算复杂性和高质量RGB-D数据集稀缺问题。

Result: 实验表明，基于低分辨率合成图像训练的网络能有效泛化到高分辨率（12MP）真实场景图像。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为相机系统提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案，无需依赖真实数据微调。

Abstract: Modern cameras with large apertures often suffer from a shallow depth of
field, resulting in blurry images of objects outside the focal plane. This
limitation is particularly problematic for fixed-focus cameras, such as those
used in smart glasses, where adding autofocus mechanisms is challenging due to
form factor and power constraints. Due to unmatched optical aberrations and
defocus properties unique to each camera system, deep learning models trained
on existing open-source datasets often face domain gaps and do not perform well
in real-world settings. In this paper, we propose an efficient and scalable
dataset synthesis approach that does not rely on fine-tuning with real-world
data. Our method simultaneously models depth-dependent defocus and spatially
varying optical aberrations, addressing both computational complexity and the
scarcity of high-quality RGB-D datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that
a network trained on our low resolution synthetic images generalizes
effectively to high resolution (12MP) real-world images across diverse scenes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种可定制的基于ROI的深度图像压缩方法，支持用户通过文本定义ROI并调整ROI与非ROI的质量权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ROI图像压缩方案固定ROI定义且缺乏质量权衡机制，无法满足多样化用户需求。

Method: 开发了文本控制的掩膜获取模块（TMA）、可自定义值分配机制（CVA）和潜在掩膜注意力模块（LMA）。

Result: 实验证明该方法有效支持ROI定制和质量权衡管理。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了ROI定义和压缩质量权衡的定制需求。

Abstract: Region of Interest (ROI)-based image compression optimizes bit allocation by
prioritizing ROI for higher-quality reconstruction. However, as the users
(including human clients and downstream machine tasks) become more diverse,
ROI-based image compression needs to be customizable to support various
preferences. For example, different users may define distinct ROI or require
different quality trade-offs between ROI and non-ROI. Existing ROI-based image
compression schemes predefine the ROI, making it unchangeable, and lack
effective mechanisms to balance reconstruction quality between ROI and non-ROI.
This work proposes a paradigm for customizable ROI-based deep image
compression. First, we develop a Text-controlled Mask Acquisition (TMA) module,
which allows users to easily customize their ROI for compression by just
inputting the corresponding semantic \emph{text}. It makes the encoder
controlled by text. Second, we design a Customizable Value Assign (CVA)
mechanism, which masks the non-ROI with a changeable extent decided by users
instead of a constant one to manage the reconstruction quality trade-off
between ROI and non-ROI. Finally, we present a Latent Mask Attention (LMA)
module, where the latent spatial prior of the mask and the latent
Rate-Distortion Optimization (RDO) prior of the image are extracted and fused
in the latent space, and further used to optimize the latent representation of
the source image. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed
customizable ROI-based deep image compression paradigm effectively addresses
the needs of customization for ROI definition and mask acquisition as well as
the reconstruction quality trade-off management between the ROI and non-ROI.

Conclusion: MedDiff-FT在生成质量、多样性和计算效率之间取得了平衡，为医学数据增强提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning for medical image segmentation are often
limited by the scarcity of high-quality training data.While diffusion models
provide a potential solution by generating synthetic images, their
effectiveness in medical imaging remains constrained due to their reliance on
large-scale medical datasets and the need for higher image quality. To address
these challenges, we present MedDiff-FT, a controllable medical image
generation method that fine-tunes a diffusion foundation model to produce
medical images with structural dependency and domain specificity in a
data-efficient manner. During inference, a dynamic adaptive guiding mask
enforces spatial constraints to ensure anatomically coherent synthesis, while a
lightweight stochastic mask generator enhances diversity through hierarchical
randomness injection. Additionally, an automated quality assessment protocol
filters suboptimal outputs using feature-space metrics, followed by mask
corrosion to refine fidelity. Evaluated on five medical segmentation
datasets,MedDiff-FT's synthetic image-mask pairs improve SOTA method's
segmentation performance by an average of 1% in Dice score. The framework
effectively balances generation quality, diversity, and computational
efficiency, offering a practical solution for medical data augmentation. The

Motivation: 现有特征匹配方法依赖稀缺且干净的多视图图像，限制了其在多样化场景中的泛化能力。传统特征编码器基于单视图2D图像训练，难以捕捉3D感知的对应关系。

Method: 第一阶段通过多视图图像合成和3D特征高斯表示学习3D感知特征编码器；第二阶段采用新视图渲染策略和大规模合成数据学习特征解码器，实现跨域泛化。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在零样本评估基准上表现出卓越的泛化能力。

Conclusion: L2M框架通过3D感知特征编码和合成数据训练，显著提升了特征匹配的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Feature matching plays a fundamental role in many computer vision tasks, yet
existing methods heavily rely on scarce and clean multi-view image collections,
which constrains their generalization to diverse and challenging scenarios.
Moreover, conventional feature encoders are typically trained on single-view 2D
images, limiting their capacity to capture 3D-aware correspondences. In this
paper, we propose a novel two-stage framework that lifts 2D images to 3D space,
named as \textbf{Lift to Match (L2M)}, taking full advantage of large-scale and
diverse single-view images. To be specific, in the first stage, we learn a
3D-aware feature encoder using a combination of multi-view image synthesis and
3D feature Gaussian representation, which injects 3D geometry knowledge into
the encoder. In the second stage, a novel-view rendering strategy, combined
with large-scale synthetic data generation from single-view images, is employed
to learn a feature decoder for robust feature matching, thus achieving
generalization across diverse domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method achieves superior generalization across zero-shot evaluation
benchmarks, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed framework for robust
feature matching.

Method: 将少样本分类问题表示为多实例验证任务，并设计了一种与预训练主干无关的MIV-head方法。

Result: MIV-head在多个设置和基准测试中表现出色，性能优于部分微调方法，且适应成本更低。

Conclusion: MIV-head是一种高效且性能优越的跨域少样本学习方法，无需微调主干网络。

Abstract: We investigate cross-domain few-shot learning under the constraint that
fine-tuning of backbones (i.e., feature extractors) is impossible or infeasible
-- a scenario that is increasingly common in practical use cases. Handling the
low-quality and static embeddings produced by frozen, "black-box" backbones
leads to a problem representation of few-shot classification as a series of
multiple instance verification (MIV) tasks. Inspired by this representation, we
introduce a novel approach to few-shot domain adaptation, named the "MIV-head",
akin to a classification head that is agnostic to any pretrained backbone and
computationally efficient. The core components designed for the MIV-head, when
trained on few-shot data from a target domain, collectively yield strong
performance on test data from that domain. Importantly, it does so without
fine-tuning the backbone, and within the "meta-testing" phase. Experimenting
under various settings and on an extension of the Meta-dataset benchmark for
cross-domain few-shot image classification, using representative off-the-shelf
convolutional neural network and vision transformer backbones pretrained on
ImageNet1K, we show that the MIV-head achieves highly competitive accuracy when
compared to state-of-the-art "adapter" (or partially fine-tuning) methods
applied to the same backbones, while incurring substantially lower adaptation
cost. We also find well-known "classification head" approaches lag far behind
in terms of accuracy. Ablation study empirically justifies the core components
of our approach. We share our code at https://github.com/xxweka/MIV-head.

Motivation: 解决3D修复中单视图参考不鲁棒、多视图外观不一致以及几何变化导致的性能限制问题。

Result: 实验证明DiGA3D在多种3D修复任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: DiGA3D通过扩散模型实现了外观和几何一致性的高效修复。

Abstract: Developing a unified pipeline that enables users to remove, re-texture, or
replace objects in a versatile manner is crucial for text-guided 3D inpainting.
However, there are still challenges in performing multiple 3D inpainting tasks
within a unified framework: 1) Single reference inpainting methods lack
robustness when dealing with views that are far from the reference view. 2)
Appearance inconsistency arises when independently inpainting multi-view images
with 2D diffusion priors; 3) Geometry inconsistency limits performance when
there are significant geometric changes in the inpainting regions. To tackle
these challenges, we introduce DiGA3D, a novel and versatile 3D inpainting
pipeline that leverages diffusion models to propagate consistent appearance and
geometry in a coarse-to-fine manner. First, DiGA3D develops a robust strategy
for selecting multiple reference views to reduce errors during propagation.
Next, DiGA3D designs an Attention Feature Propagation (AFP) mechanism that
propagates attention features from the selected reference views to other views
via diffusion models to maintain appearance consistency. Furthermore, DiGA3D
introduces a Texture-Geometry Score Distillation Sampling (TG-SDS) loss to
further improve the geometric consistency of inpainted 3D scenes. Extensive
experiments on multiple 3D inpainting tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of
our method. The project page is available at https://rorisis.github.io/DiGA3D/.

Motivation: 手写数学表达式识别（HMER）因复杂的公式结构和字符布局而面临序列预测的挑战，频域信息可能提供结构分析的辅助。

Abstract: Handwritten mathematical expression recognition (HMER) suffers from complex
formula structures and character layouts in sequence prediction. In this paper,
we incorporate frequency domain analysis into HMER and propose a method that
marries frequency domain with HMER (MFH), leveraging the discrete cosine

demonstrating the efficacy of frequency domain information. Experiments show
that our MFH-CoMER achieves noteworthy accuracyrates of 61.66%/62.07%/63.72% on

Motivation: 解决PMRF在像素空间中建模时与人类感知对齐不足的问题，提出潜在空间建模以更好地匹配人类感知。

Method: 在VAE的潜在空间中重新定义PMRF，利用潜在表示的最小失真估计源分布，并通过VAE的重构误差限制最小失真。

Result: Latent-PMRF在盲人脸恢复任务中表现优异，实现了比现有方法更好的感知-失真平衡，且收敛效率显著提升（5.79倍加速）。

Conclusion: Latent-PMRF通过潜在空间建模有效改善了感知-失真平衡，同时展示了VAE设计对性能的关键影响。

Abstract: The Perception-Distortion tradeoff (PD-tradeoff) theory suggests that face
restoration algorithms must balance perceptual quality and fidelity. To achieve
minimal distortion while maintaining perfect perceptual quality, Posterior-Mean
Rectified Flow (PMRF) proposes a flow based approach where source distribution
is minimum distortion estimations. Although PMRF is shown to be effective, its
pixel-space modeling approach limits its ability to align with human
perception, where human perception is defined as how humans distinguish between
two image distributions. In this work, we propose Latent-PMRF, which
reformulates PMRF in the latent space of a variational autoencoder (VAE),
facilitating better alignment with human perception during optimization. By
defining the source distribution on latent representations of minimum
distortion estimation, we bound the minimum distortion by the VAE's
reconstruction error. Moreover, we reveal the design of VAE is crucial, and our
proposed VAE significantly outperforms existing VAEs in both reconstruction and
restoration. Extensive experiments on blind face restoration demonstrate the
superiority of Latent-PMRF, offering an improved PD-tradeoff compared to
existing methods, along with remarkable convergence efficiency, achieving a
5.79X speedup over PMRF in terms of FID. Our code will be available as
open-source.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉语言跟踪中因目标移动导致的视觉输入与语言描述不对齐问题，以及现有方法未充分考虑的时空尺度差异。

Method: 将语言描述分解为具有不同属性的短语，并细粒度地修改其特征；引入包含前一帧语言信息的视觉语言标记，以提取更相关的视觉特征。

Result: 实验表明，ATSTrack性能与现有方法相当。

Conclusion: ATSTrack通过时空尺度对齐有效提升了视觉语言跟踪的性能。

Abstract: A main challenge of Visual-Language Tracking (VLT) is the misalignment
between visual inputs and language descriptions caused by target movement.
Previous trackers have explored many effective feature modification methods to
preserve more aligned features. However, an important yet unexplored factor
ultimately hinders their capability, which is the inherent differences in the
temporal and spatial scale of information between visual and language inputs.
To address this issue, we propose a novel visual-language tracker that enhances
the effect of feature modification by \textbf{A}ligning \textbf{T}emporal and
\textbf{S}patial scale of different input components, named as
\textbf{ATSTrack}. Specifically, we decompose each language description into
phrases with different attributes based on their temporal and spatial
correspondence with visual inputs, and modify their features in a fine-grained
manner. Moreover, we introduce a Visual-Language token that comprises modified
linguistic information from the previous frame to guide the model to extract
visual features that are more relevant to language description, thereby
reducing the impact caused by the differences in spatial scale. Experimental
results show that our proposed ATSTrack achieves performance comparable to
existing methods. Our code will be released.

Result: 在OOD和跨数据集基准测试中，MS-TTA表现优于现有方法，实现稳定适应。

Conclusion: MS-TTA无需额外训练即可提升CLIP在分布偏移下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Visual-language models (VLMs) like CLIP exhibit strong generalization but
struggle with distribution shifts at test time. Existing training-free
test-time adaptation (TTA) methods operate strictly within CLIP's original
feature space, relying on high-confidence samples while overlooking the
potential of low-confidence ones. We propose MS-TTA, a training-free approach
that enhances feature representations beyond CLIP's space using a single-step
k-nearest neighbors (kNN) Mean-Shift. By refining all test samples, MS-TTA
improves feature compactness and class separability, leading to more stable
adaptation. Additionally, a cache of refined embeddings further enhances
inference by providing Mean Shift enhanced logits. Extensive evaluations on OOD
and cross-dataset benchmarks demonstrate that MS-TTA consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art training-free TTA methods, achieving robust adaptation without
requiring additional training.

Result: 在多个VideoQA基准测试中，Bisecle有效缓解遗忘并提升跨任务泛化能力。

Conclusion: Bisecle为视频语言持续学习提供了一种高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Frontier vision-language models (VLMs) have made remarkable improvements in
video understanding tasks. However, real-world videos typically exist as
continuously evolving data streams (e.g., dynamic scenes captured by wearable
glasses), necessitating models to continually adapt to shifting data
distributions and novel scenarios. Considering the prohibitive computational
costs of fine-tuning models on new tasks, usually, a small subset of parameters
is updated while the bulk of the model remains frozen. This poses new
challenges to existing continual learning frameworks in the context of large
multimodal foundation models, i.e., catastrophic forgetting and update
conflict. While the foundation models struggle with parameter-efficient
continual learning, the hippocampus in the human brain has evolved highly
efficient mechanisms for memory formation and consolidation. Inspired by the
rapid Binding and pattern separation mechanisms in the hippocampus, in this
work, we propose Bisecle for video-language continual learning, where a
multi-directional supervision module is used to capture more cross-modal
relationships and a contrastive prompt learning scheme is designed to isolate
task-specific knowledge to facilitate efficient memory storage. Binding and
separation processes further strengthen the ability of VLMs to retain complex
experiences, enabling robust and efficient continual learning in video
understanding tasks. We perform a thorough evaluation of the proposed Bisecle,
demonstrating its ability to mitigate forgetting and enhance cross-task
generalization on several VideoQA benchmarks.

Method: 采用非向量量化的自回归过程建模运动预测，利用扩散过程表示运动分布；通过交互行为理解（IBU）和对话状态理解（CSU）提升交互真实性。

Result: 实验验证了模型的有效性，实现了更准确的连续空间预测和更真实的交互行为。

Conclusion: ARIG框架在实时性和交互真实性上优于现有方法，为虚拟代理的交互提供了新思路。

Abstract: Face-to-face communication, as a common human activity, motivates the
research on interactive head generation. A virtual agent can generate motion
responses with both listening and speaking capabilities based on the audio or
motion signals of the other user and itself. However, previous clip-wise
generation paradigm or explicit listener/speaker generator-switching methods
have limitations in future signal acquisition, contextual behavioral
understanding, and switching smoothness, making it challenging to be real-time
and realistic. In this paper, we propose an autoregressive (AR) based
frame-wise framework called ARIG to realize the real-time generation with
better interaction realism. To achieve real-time generation, we model motion
prediction as a non-vector-quantized AR process. Unlike discrete codebook-index
prediction, we represent motion distribution using diffusion procedure,
achieving more accurate predictions in continuous space. To improve interaction
realism, we emphasize interactive behavior understanding (IBU) and detailed
conversational state understanding (CSU). In IBU, based on dual-track
dual-modal signals, we summarize short-range behaviors through
bidirectional-integrated learning and perform contextual understanding over
long ranges. In CSU, we use voice activity signals and context features of IBU
to understand the various states (interruption, feedback, pause, etc.) that
exist in actual conversations. These serve as conditions for the final
progressive motion prediction. Extensive experiments have verified the
effectiveness of our model.

Conclusion: ADAptation框架在临床领域适应中表现出高效性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Deep learning-based diagnostic models often suffer performance drops due to
distribution shifts between training (source) and test (target) domains.
Collecting and labeling sufficient target domain data for model retraining
represents an optimal solution, yet is limited by time and scarce resources.
Active learning (AL) offers an efficient approach to reduce annotation costs
while maintaining performance, but struggles to handle the challenge posed by
distribution variations across different datasets. In this study, we propose a
novel unsupervised Active learning framework for Domain Adaptation, named
ADAptation, which efficiently selects informative samples from multi-domain
data pools under limited annotation budget. As a fundamental step, our method
first utilizes the distribution homogenization capabilities of diffusion models
to bridge cross-dataset gaps by translating target images into source-domain
style. We then introduce two key innovations: (a) a hypersphere-constrained
contrastive learning network for compact feature clustering, and (b) a
dual-scoring mechanism that quantifies and balances sample uncertainty and
representativeness. Extensive experiments on four breast ultrasound datasets
(three public and one in-house/multi-center) across five common deep
classifiers demonstrate that our method surpasses existing strong AL-based
competitors, validating its effectiveness and generalization for clinical
domain adaptation. The code is available at the anonymized link:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LMMs在视觉感知任务中的缺陷，填补系统性研究的空白，并解决潜在的安全问题。

Method: 提出LMM-JND概念及测定流程，构建包含21.5k参考图像和489k刺激的大规模数据集VPA-JND，分析多种LMMs的表现。

Result: 发现当前先进LMMs（如GPT-4o和InternVL2.5系列）在基础比较任务中表现不佳，远低于人类水平。

Conclusion: LMM-JND为研究LMMs提供了新视角，其可预测性对安全至关重要，未来研究可基于此优化LMMs的视觉能力。

Abstract: Just noticeable difference (JND), the minimum change that the human visual
system (HVS) can perceive, has been studied for decades. Although recent work
has extended this line of research into machine vision, there has been a
scarcity of studies systematically exploring its perceptual boundaries across
multiple tasks and stimulus types, particularly in the current era of rapidly
advancing large multimodal models (LMMs), where studying the multifaceted
capabilities of models has become a mainstream focus. Moreover, the perceptual
defects of LMMs are not investigated thoroughly, resulting in potential
security issues and suboptimal response efficiency. In this paper, we take an
initial attempt and demonstrate that there exist significant visual blind spots
in current LMMs. To systemically quantify this characteristic, we propose a new
concept, {\bf LMM-JND}, together with its determination pipeline. Targeting
uncovering the behavior commonalities in HVS-aligned visual perception tasks,
we delve into several LMM families and construct a large-scale dataset, named
VPA-JND, which contains 21.5k reference images with over 489k stimuli across 12
distortion types, to facilitate LMM-JND studies. VPA-JND exposes areas where
state-of-the-art LMMs, including GPT-4o and the InternVL2.5 series, struggle
with basic comparison queries and fall significantly short of human-level
visual performance. We further explore the effects of vision and language
backbones and find a notable correlation between their design philosophy that
may instruct the future refinement of LMMs for their visual acuity. Together,
our research underscores the significance of LMM-JND as a unique perspective
for studying LMMs, and predictable LMM-JND is crucial for security concerns.

### [107] [Visual Anagrams Reveal Hidden Differences in Holistic Shape Processing Across Vision Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00493)
*Fenil R. Doshi,Thomas Fel,Talia Konkle,George Alvarez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的形状评估方法——Configural Shape Score (CSS)，用于衡量模型对全局配置形状的敏感性，发现自监督和语言对齐的Transformer模型表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉模型主要依赖局部纹理线索，忽视了全局配置形状的重要性，导致特征脆弱且非组合性。论文旨在探索模型能否同时利用纹理和形状线索。

Method: 通过Object-Anagram对评估模型的配置形状敏感性，提出CSS评分，并测试了86种卷积、Transformer和混合模型。

Result: 自监督和语言对齐的Transformer模型（如DINOv2、SigLIP2和EVA-CLIP）在CSS评分中表现最佳，且依赖长程交互。BagNet表现随机，排除了边界策略。

Conclusion: 构建真正鲁棒且类人的视觉系统需要同时整合局部纹理和全局配置形状，而非在二者之间做选择。

Abstract: Humans are able to recognize objects based on both local texture cues and the
configuration of object parts, yet contemporary vision models primarily harvest
local texture cues, yielding brittle, non-compositional features. Work on
shape-vs-texture bias has pitted shape and texture representations in
opposition, measuring shape relative to texture, ignoring the possibility that
models (and humans) can simultaneously rely on both types of cues, and
obscuring the absolute quality of both types of representation. We therefore
recast shape evaluation as a matter of absolute configural competence,
operationalized by the Configural Shape Score (CSS), which (i) measures the
ability to recognize both images in Object-Anagram pairs that preserve local
texture while permuting global part arrangement to depict different object
categories. Across 86 convolutional, transformer, and hybrid models, CSS (ii)
uncovers a broad spectrum of configural sensitivity with fully self-supervised
and language-aligned transformers -- exemplified by DINOv2, SigLIP2 and
EVA-CLIP -- occupying the top end of the CSS spectrum. Mechanistic probes
reveal that (iii) high-CSS networks depend on long-range interactions:
radius-controlled attention masks abolish performance showing a distinctive
U-shaped integration profile, and representational-similarity analyses expose a
mid-depth transition from local to global coding. A BagNet control remains at
chance (iv), ruling out "border-hacking" strategies. Finally, (v) we show that
configural shape score also predicts other shape-dependent evals. Overall, we
propose that the path toward truly robust, generalizable, and human-like vision
systems may not lie in forcing an artificial choice between shape and texture,
but rather in architectural and learning frameworks that seamlessly integrate
both local-texture and global configural shape.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于SSM的方法在重建局部结构和高维数据处理上表现不足，导致细粒度特征恢复不理想。

Method: 利用拉普拉斯分解将图像分为高低频分量，分别通过SSM和CNN处理，并结合信息保留的下采样技术。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Laplace-Mamba在恢复质量和效率上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Laplace-Mamba通过双路径设计和拉普拉斯分解，有效解决了图像去雾中的局部结构和高维数据问题。

Abstract: Recent progress in image restoration has underscored Spatial State Models
(SSMs) as powerful tools for modeling long-range dependencies, owing to their
appealing linear complexity and computational efficiency. However, SSM-based
approaches exhibit limitations in reconstructing localized structures and tend
to be less effective when handling high-dimensional data, frequently resulting
in suboptimal recovery of fine image features. To tackle these challenges, we
introduce Laplace-Mamba, a novel framework that integrates Laplace frequency
prior with a hybrid Mamba-CNN architecture for efficient image dehazing.
Leveraging the Laplace decomposition, the image is disentangled into
low-frequency components capturing global texture and high-frequency components
representing edges and fine details. This decomposition enables specialized
processing via dual parallel pathways: the low-frequency branch employs SSMs
for global context modeling, while the high-frequency branch utilizes CNNs to
refine local structural details, effectively addressing diverse haze scenarios.
Notably, the Laplace transformation facilitates information-preserving
downsampling of low-frequency components in accordance with the Nyquist theory,
thereby significantly improving computational efficiency. Extensive evaluations
across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches in both restoration quality and efficiency. The

Motivation: 现有CTTA方法依赖共享模型参数，易受特征纠缠和灾难性遗忘影响，尤其在非平稳域偏移下表现不佳。

Method: 提出ExPaMoE框架，采用双分支专家设计和基于频域线索的实时分布变化检测器（SODD），动态扩展专家池。

Result: 在多个标准基准测试（如CIFAR-10C、ImageNet-C等）和新引入的ImageNet++上表现优异，具有强鲁棒性和抗遗忘性。

Conclusion: ExPaMoE在持续测试时适应任务中显著优于现有方法，适用于复杂域演化场景。

Abstract: Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) aims to enable models to adapt
on-the-fly to a stream of unlabeled data under evolving distribution shifts.
However, existing CTTA methods typically rely on shared model parameters across
all domains, making them vulnerable to feature entanglement and catastrophic
forgetting in the presence of large or non-stationary domain shifts. To address
this limitation, we propose \textbf{ExPaMoE}, a novel framework based on an
\emph{Expandable Parallel Mixture-of-Experts} architecture. ExPaMoE decouples
domain-general and domain-specific knowledge via a dual-branch expert design
with token-guided feature separation, and dynamically expands its expert pool
based on a \emph{Spectral-Aware Online Domain Discriminator} (SODD) that
detects distribution changes in real-time using frequency-domain cues.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of ExPaMoE across diverse
CTTA scenarios. We evaluate our method on standard benchmarks including
CIFAR-10C, CIFAR-100C, ImageNet-C, and Cityscapes-to-ACDC for semantic
segmentation. Additionally, we introduce \textbf{ImageNet++}, a large-scale and
realistic CTTA benchmark built from multiple ImageNet-derived datasets, to
better reflect long-term adaptation under complex domain evolution. ExPaMoE
consistently outperforms prior arts, showing strong robustness, scalability,
and resistance to forgetting.

Motivation: CLIP-ViT在捕捉局部关系时表现不佳，影响多模态大语言模型的细节理解能力。

Method: 提出LLaVA-SP，添加空间视觉标记，使用卷积核生成视觉空间标记，并通过交叉注意力机制融合细粒度信息。提供两种变体：LLaVA-SP-Cropping和LLaVA-SP-Pooling。

Result: 在多个多模态基准测试中表现优异，性能超过LLaVA-1.5，推理延迟几乎相同。

Conclusion: LLaVA-SP通过简单高效的方法显著提升了视觉表示能力，适用于多样化视觉理解任务。

Abstract: The architecture of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) commonly
connects a vision encoder, often based on CLIP-ViT, to a large language model.
While CLIP-ViT works well for capturing global image features, it struggles to
model local relationships between adjacent patches, leading to weaker visual
representation, which in turn affects the detailed understanding ability of
MLLMs. To solve this, we propose LLaVA-SP, which \textbf{ only adds six spatial
visual tokens} to the original visual tokens to enhance the visual
representation. Our approach offers three key advantages: 1)We propose a novel
Projector, which uses convolutional kernels to derive visual spatial tokens
from ViT patch features, simulating two visual spatial ordering approaches:
``from central region to global" and ``from abstract to specific". Then, a
cross-attention mechanism is applied to fuse fine-grained visual information,
enriching the overall visual representation. 2) We present two model variants:
LLaVA-SP-Cropping, which focuses on detail features through progressive
cropping, and LLaVA-SP-Pooling, which captures global semantics through
adaptive pooling, enabling the model to handle diverse visual understanding
tasks. 3) Extensive experiments show that LLaVA-SP, fine-tuned with LoRA,
achieves significant performance improvements across various multimodal
benchmarks, outperforming the state-of-the-art LLaVA-1.5 model in multiple
tasks with nearly identical inference latency. The code and models are

Motivation: 现有方法在视觉-语言预训练模型（如CLIP）用于行人重识别任务时，常忽视跨模态交互，导致高计算成本或对齐效果不佳。

Method: 提出选择性视觉提示融合（SVIP）和扰动驱动一致性对齐（PDCA）两种创新方法，动态注入视觉特征并增强跨模态鲁棒性。

Result: 在多个流行基准测试中表现优异，实现了性能与计算开销的最佳平衡。

Conclusion: SCING框架通过轻量级设计显著提升了跨模态对齐效果，同时保持高效推理。

Abstract: Recent advancements in adapting vision-language pre-training models like CLIP
for person re-identification (ReID) tasks often rely on complex adapter design
or modality-specific tuning while neglecting cross-modal interaction, leading
to high computational costs or suboptimal alignment. To address these
limitations, we propose a simple yet effective framework named Selective
Cross-modal Prompt Tuning (SCING) that enhances cross-modal alignment and
robustness against real-world perturbations. Our method introduces two key
innovations: Firstly, we proposed Selective Visual Prompt Fusion (SVIP), a
lightweight module that dynamically injects discriminative visual features into
text prompts via a cross-modal gating mechanism. Moreover, the proposed
Perturbation-Driven Consistency Alignment (PDCA) is a dual-path training
strategy that enforces invariant feature alignment under random image
perturbations by regularizing consistency between original and augmented
cross-modal embeddings. Extensive experiments are conducted on several popular
benchmarks covering Market1501, DukeMTMC-ReID, Occluded-Duke, Occluded-REID,
and P-DukeMTMC, which demonstrate the impressive performance of the proposed
method. Notably, our framework eliminates heavy adapters while maintaining
efficient inference, achieving an optimal trade-off between performance and
computational overhead. The code will be released upon acceptance.

Conclusion: TopoNet在临床腹腔镜肝脏手术中具有应用潜力。

Abstract: Liver landmarks provide crucial anatomical guidance to the surgeon during
laparoscopic liver surgery to minimize surgical risk. However, the tubular
structural properties of landmarks and dynamic intraoperative deformations pose
significant challenges for automatic landmark detection. In this study, we
introduce TopoNet, a novel topology-constrained learning framework for
laparoscopic liver landmark detection. Our framework adopts a snake-CNN
dual-path encoder to simultaneously capture detailed RGB texture information
and depth-informed topological structures. Meanwhile, we propose a
boundary-aware topology fusion (BTF) module, which adaptively merges RGB-D
features to enhance edge perception while preserving global topology.
Additionally, a topological constraint loss function is embedded, which
contains a center-line constraint loss and a topological persistence loss to
ensure homotopy equivalence between predictions and labels. Extensive
experiments on L3D and P2ILF datasets demonstrate that TopoNet achieves
outstanding accuracy and computational complexity, highlighting the potential
for clinical applications in laparoscopic liver surgery. Our code will be

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VLMs在真实场景中难以捕捉用户意图，现有数据集局限于全场景描述或路径点预测，无法评估VLMs对局部用户驱动查询的响应能力。

Method: 提出Box-QAymo数据集，用户通过绘制边界框表达意图，支持分层评估协议（从基本能力到属性预测、运动理解和时空推理）。

Result: 评估显示当前VLMs在感知问题上的显著局限性，揭示了与现实世界性能的差距。

Conclusion: 该工作为开发更鲁棒和可解释的自动驾驶系统奠定了基础，支持真实条件下的有效用户沟通。

Abstract: Interpretable communication is essential for safe and trustworthy autonomous
driving, yet current vision-language models (VLMs) often operate under
idealized assumptions and struggle to capture user intent in real-world
scenarios. Existing driving-oriented VQA datasets are limited to full-scene
descriptions or waypoint prediction, preventing the assessment of whether VLMs
can respond to localized user-driven queries. We introduce Box-QAymo, a
box-referring dataset and benchmark designed to both evaluate and finetune VLMs
on spatial and temporal reasoning over user-specified objects. Users express
intent by drawing bounding boxes, offering a fast and intuitive interface for
focused queries in complex scenes. Specifically, we propose a hierarchical
evaluation protocol that begins with binary sanity-check questions to assess
basic model capacities, and progresses to (1) attribute prediction for
box-referred objects, (2) motion understanding of target instances, and (3)
spatiotemporal motion reasoning over inter-object dynamics across frames. To
support this, we crowd-sourced fine-grained object classes and visual
attributes that reflect the complexity drivers encounter, and extract object
trajectories to construct temporally grounded QA pairs. Rigorous quality
control through negative sampling, temporal consistency checks, and
difficulty-aware balancing guarantee dataset robustness and diversity. Our
comprehensive evaluation reveals significant limitations in current VLMs when
queried about perception questions, highlighting the gap in achieving
real-world performance. This work provides a foundation for developing more
robust and interpretable autonomous driving systems that can communicate
effectively with users under real-world conditions. Project page and dataset

Motivation: 尽管CLIP在多种应用中表现稳健，但某些注意力头可能对最终表示产生负面影响，消融这些头可以提升性能。

Method: 提出AAT方法，通过操纵注意力权重来抑制特定头的贡献，并结合两种策略以适应不同场景。

Result: 实验表明，AAT在跨模态检索等任务中显著提升性能，召回率最高提升11.1%。

Conclusion: AAT能有效优化大规模视觉语言模型，且几乎不增加推理成本。

Abstract: This paper studies the role of attention heads in CLIP's image encoder. While
CLIP has exhibited robust performance across diverse applications, we
hypothesize that certain attention heads negatively affect final
representations and that ablating them can improve performance in downstream
tasks. To capitalize on this insight, we propose a simple yet effective method,
called Attention Ablation Technique (AAT), to suppress the contribution of
specific heads by manipulating attention weights. By integrating two
alternative strategies tailored for different application scenarios, AAT
systematically identifies and ablates detrimental attention heads to enhance
representation quality. Experiments demonstrate that AAT consistently improves
downstream task performance across various domains, boosting recall rate by up
to 11.1% on CLIP-family models for cross-modal retrieval. The results highlight
the potential of AAT to effectively refine large-scale vision-language models
with virtually no increase in inference cost.

Result: 在公开数据集和新合成数据集上，LOD-GS实现了SOTA渲染质量，有效消除混叠。

Conclusion: LOD-GS框架显著提升了3D高斯溅射的抗混叠能力，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Despite the advancements in quality and efficiency achieved by 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) in 3D scene rendering, aliasing artifacts remain a persistent
challenge. Existing approaches primarily rely on low-pass filtering to mitigate
aliasing. However, these methods are not sensitive to the sampling rate, often
resulting in under-filtering and over-smoothing renderings. To address this
limitation, we propose LOD-GS, a Level-of-Detail-sensitive filtering framework
for Gaussian Splatting, which dynamically predicts the optimal filtering
strength for each 3D Gaussian primitive. Specifically, we introduce a set of
basis functions to each Gaussian, which take the sampling rate as input to
model appearance variations, enabling sampling-rate-sensitive filtering. These
basis function parameters are jointly optimized with the 3D Gaussian in an
end-to-end manner. The sampling rate is influenced by both focal length and
camera distance. However, existing methods and datasets rely solely on
down-sampling to simulate focal length changes for anti-aliasing evaluation,
overlooking the impact of camera distance. To enable a more comprehensive
assessment, we introduce a new synthetic dataset featuring objects rendered at
varying camera distances. Extensive experiments on both public datasets and our
newly collected dataset demonstrate that our method achieves SOTA rendering
quality while effectively eliminating aliasing. The code and dataset have been
open-sourced.

Conclusion: PGFA通过改进特征对齐和减少分布差异，显著提升了零样本骨架动作识别的性能。

Abstract: Zero-shot skeleton-based action recognition aims to classify unseen
skeleton-based human actions without prior exposure to such categories during
training. This task is extremely challenging due to the difficulty in
generalizing from known to unknown actions. Previous studies typically use
two-stage training: pre-training skeleton encoders on seen action categories
using cross-entropy loss and then aligning pre-extracted skeleton and text
features, enabling knowledge transfer to unseen classes through skeleton-text
alignment and language models' generalization. However, their efficacy is
hindered by 1) insufficient discrimination for skeleton features, as the fixed
skeleton encoder fails to capture necessary alignment information for effective
skeleton-text alignment; 2) the neglect of alignment bias between skeleton and
unseen text features during testing. To this end, we propose a prototype-guided
feature alignment paradigm for zero-shot skeleton-based action recognition,
termed PGFA. Specifically, we develop an end-to-end cross-modal contrastive
training framework to improve skeleton-text alignment, ensuring sufficient
discrimination for skeleton features. Additionally, we introduce a
prototype-guided text feature alignment strategy to mitigate the adverse impact
of the distribution discrepancy during testing. We provide a theoretical
analysis to support our prototype-guided text feature alignment strategy and
empirically evaluate our overall PGFA on three well-known datasets. Compared
with the top competitor SMIE method, our PGFA achieves absolute accuracy
improvements of 22.96%, 12.53%, and 18.54% on the NTU-60, NTU-120, and PKU-MMD
datasets, respectively.

Conclusion: OOD检测是构建可靠、安全和鲁棒AI系统的关键，尤其在3D视觉集成等领域具有广阔前景。

Abstract: The ability to detect objects that are not prevalent in the training set is a
critical capability in many 3D applications, including autonomous driving.
Machine learning methods for object recognition often assume that all object
categories encountered during inference belong to a closed set of classes
present in the training data. This assumption limits generalization to the real
world, as objects not seen during training may be misclassified or entirely
ignored. As part of reliable AI, OOD detection identifies inputs that deviate
significantly from the training distribution. This paper provides a
comprehensive overview of OOD detection within the broader scope of trustworthy
and uncertain AI. We begin with key use cases across diverse domains, introduce
benchmark datasets spanning multiple modalities, and discuss evaluation
metrics. Next, we present a comparative analysis of OOD detection
methodologies, exploring model structures, uncertainty indicators, and
distributional distance taxonomies, alongside uncertainty calibration
techniques. Finally, we highlight promising research directions, including
adversarially robust OOD detection and failure identification, particularly
relevant to 3D applications. The paper offers both theoretical and practical
insights into OOD detection, showcasing emerging research opportunities such as
3D vision integration. These insights help new researchers navigate the field
more effectively, contributing to the development of reliable, safe, and robust
AI systems.

Conclusion: ReStraV为AI生成视频检测提供了低成本高效解决方案，并揭示了神经表示几何的新应用。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI enables highly realistic synthetic
videos, posing significant challenges for content authentication and raising
urgent concerns about misuse. Existing detection methods often struggle with
generalization and capturing subtle temporal inconsistencies. We propose
ReStraV(Representation Straightening Video), a novel approach to distinguish
natural from AI-generated videos. Inspired by the "perceptual straightening"
hypothesis -- which suggests real-world video trajectories become more straight
in neural representation domain -- we analyze deviations from this expected
geometric property. Using a pre-trained self-supervised vision transformer
(DINOv2), we quantify the temporal curvature and stepwise distance in the
model's representation domain. We aggregate statistics of these measures for
each video and train a classifier. Our analysis shows that AI-generated videos
exhibit significantly different curvature and distance patterns compared to
real videos. A lightweight classifier achieves state-of-the-art detection
performance (e.g., 97.17% accuracy and 98.63% AUROC on the VidProM benchmark),
substantially outperforming existing image- and video-based methods. ReStraV is
computationally efficient, it is offering a low-cost and effective detection
solution. This work provides new insights into using neural representation
geometry for AI-generated video detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受猕猴初级视觉皮层中“祖母细胞”启发，探索其在医学图像分割中的应用价值。

Method: 设计Sim-MPNet，包括动态记忆权重损失注意力（DMW-LA）和双相似性全局内部增强模块（DS-GIM）。

Result: 在四个公开数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Sim-MPNet通过相似性记忆先验和动态更新策略，有效提升医学图像分割性能。

Abstract: In recent years, it has been found that "grandmother cells" in the primary
visual cortex (V1) of macaques can directly recognize visual input with complex
shapes. This inspires us to examine the value of these cells in promoting the
research of medical image segmentation. In this paper, we design a Similarity
Memory Prior Network (Sim-MPNet) for medical image segmentation. Specifically,
we propose a Dynamic Memory Weights-Loss Attention (DMW-LA), which matches and
remembers the category features of specific lesions or organs in medical images
through the similarity memory prior in the prototype memory bank, thus helping
the network to learn subtle texture changes between categories. DMW-LA also
dynamically updates the similarity memory prior in reverse through Weight-Loss
Dynamic (W-LD) update strategy, effectively assisting the network directly
extract category features. In addition, we propose the Double-Similarity Global
Internal Enhancement Module (DS-GIM) to deeply explore the internal differences
in the feature distribution of input data through cosine similarity and
euclidean distance. Extensive experiments on four public datasets show that
Sim-MPNet has better segmentation performance than other state-of-the-art
methods. Our code is available on https://github.com/vpsg-research/Sim-MPNet.

Conclusion: 上下文信息对学术情感识别至关重要，RAER数据集和CLIP-CAER方法填补了研究空白。

Abstract: Academic emotion analysis plays a crucial role in evaluating students'
engagement and cognitive states during the learning process. This paper
addresses the challenge of automatically recognizing academic emotions through
facial expressions in real-world learning environments. While significant
progress has been made in facial expression recognition for basic emotions,
academic emotion recognition remains underexplored, largely due to the scarcity
of publicly available datasets. To bridge this gap, we introduce RAER, a novel
dataset comprising approximately 2,700 video clips collected from around 140
students in diverse, natural learning contexts such as classrooms, libraries,
laboratories, and dormitories, covering both classroom sessions and individual
study. Each clip was annotated independently by approximately ten annotators
using two distinct sets of academic emotion labels with varying granularity,
enhancing annotation consistency and reliability. To our knowledge, RAER is the
first dataset capturing diverse natural learning scenarios. Observing that
annotators naturally consider context cues-such as whether a student is looking
at a phone or reading a book-alongside facial expressions, we propose CLIP-CAER
(CLIP-based Context-aware Academic Emotion Recognition). Our method utilizes
learnable text prompts within the vision-language model CLIP to effectively
integrate facial expression and context cues from videos. Experimental results
demonstrate that CLIP-CAER substantially outperforms state-of-the-art
video-based facial expression recognition methods, which are primarily designed
for basic emotions, emphasizing the crucial role of context in accurately
recognizing academic emotions. Project page: https://zgsfer.github.io/CAER

Motivation: 卡车安全超车对防止事故和提升交通效率至关重要，准确预测超车行为能为ADAS系统提供及时决策支持。

Method: 使用Volvo提供的五辆卡车CAN总线数据，评估三种分类器（ANN、RF、SVM），分析预处理配置对性能的影响，并采用分数级融合策略优化结果。

Result: 多车训练提升泛化能力，分数级融合策略在多数情况下表现最佳，最终实现TNR=93%和TPR=86.5%的准确率。

Conclusion: 数据多样性和多车训练是提升超车检测性能的关键，分数级融合策略显著优化了分类结果。

Abstract: Safe overtaking manoeuvres in trucks are vital for preventing accidents and
ensuring efficient traffic flow. Accurate prediction of such manoeuvres is
essential for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) to make timely and
informed decisions. In this study, we focus on overtake detection using
Controller Area Network (CAN) bus data collected from five in-service trucks
provided by the Volvo Group. We evaluate three common classifiers for vehicle
manoeuvre detection, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Random Forest (RF), and
Support Vector Machines (SVM), and analyse how different preprocessing
configurations affect performance. We find that variability in traffic
conditions strongly influences the signal patterns, particularly in the
no-overtake class, affecting classification performance if training data lacks
adequate diversity. Since the data were collected under unconstrained,
real-world conditions, class diversity cannot be guaranteed a priori. However,
training with data from multiple vehicles improves generalisation and reduces
condition-specific bias. Our pertruck analysis also reveals that classification
accuracy, especially for overtakes, depends on the amount of training data per
vehicle. To address this, we apply a score-level fusion strategy, which yields
the best per-truck performance across most cases. Overall, we achieve an
accuracy via fusion of TNR=93% (True Negative Rate) and TPR=86.5% (True
Positive Rate). This research has been part of the BIG FUN project, which
explores how Artificial Intelligence can be applied to logged vehicle data to
understand and predict driver behaviour, particularly in relation to Camera
Monitor Systems (CMS), being introduced as digital replacements for traditional
exterior mirrors.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving directly generates planning trajectories from
raw sensor data, yet it typically relies on costly perception supervision to
extract scene information. A critical research challenge arises: constructing
an informative driving world model to enable perception annotation-free,
end-to-end planning via self-supervised learning. In this paper, we present
World4Drive, an end-to-end autonomous driving framework that employs vision
foundation models to build latent world models for generating and evaluating
multi-modal planning trajectories. Specifically, World4Drive first extracts
scene features, including driving intention and world latent representations
enriched with spatial-semantic priors provided by vision foundation models. It
then generates multi-modal planning trajectories based on current scene
features and driving intentions and predicts multiple intention-driven future
states within the latent space. Finally, it introduces a world model selector
module to evaluate and select the best trajectory. We achieve perception
annotation-free, end-to-end planning through self-supervised alignment between
actual future observations and predicted observations reconstructed from the
latent space. World4Drive achieves state-of-the-art performance without manual
perception annotations on both the open-loop nuScenes and closed-loop NavSim
benchmarks, demonstrating an 18.1\% relative reduction in L2 error, 46.7% lower
collision rate, and 3.75 faster training convergence. Codes will be accessed at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 交通场景中目标检测需要大量高质量标注数据，而自标记方法因简单高效受到关注，但其性能不及域对齐方法。研究发现简单样本比例过高（简单标签偏差）是主要原因。

Method: 提出DeSimPL方法，利用实例级记忆库更新伪标签策略，引入对抗样本增加样本多样性，并采用自适应加权损失避免后期训练中的假阳性伪标签问题。

Result: 实验表明DeSimPL有效减少简单样本比例，显著提升自标记检测器性能，四个基准测试验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: DeSimPL通过解决简单标签偏差问题，为自标记检测器提供了性能提升的有效途径。

Abstract: Despite its significant success, object detection in traffic and
transportation scenarios requires time-consuming and laborious efforts in
acquiring high-quality labeled data. Therefore, Unsupervised Domain Adaptation
(UDA) for object detection has recently gained increasing research attention.
UDA for object detection has been dominated by domain alignment methods, which
achieve top performance. Recently, self-labeling methods have gained popularity
due to their simplicity and efficiency. In this paper, we investigate the
limitations that prevent self-labeling detectors from achieving commensurate
performance with domain alignment methods. Specifically, we identify the high
proportion of simple samples during training, i.e., the simple-label bias, as
the central cause. We propose a novel approach called De-Simplifying Pseudo
Labels (DeSimPL) to mitigate the issue. DeSimPL utilizes an instance-level
memory bank to implement an innovative pseudo label updating strategy. Then,
adversarial samples are introduced during training to enhance the proportion.
Furthermore, we propose an adaptive weighted loss to avoid the model suffering
from an abundance of false positive pseudo labels in the late training period.
Experimental results demonstrate that DeSimPL effectively reduces the
proportion of simple samples during training, leading to a significant
performance improvement for self-labeling detectors. Extensive experiments
conducted on four benchmarks validate our analysis and conclusions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉目标跟踪方法主要针对良好条件的白天数据，而在恶劣天气条件下性能显著下降，因此需要一种能够适应多种天气条件的解决方案。

Method: 使用可控场景生成器合成少量未标记视频，设计域定制适配器（DCA）快速适应不同天气条件，并提出目标感知置信对齐模块（TCA）增强定位一致性。

Result: UMDATrack在实验中显著超越现有先进视觉跟踪器，达到新的最优性能。

Conclusion: UMDATrack通过统一域适应框架，有效解决了恶劣天气条件下的目标跟踪问题，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Visual object tracking has gained promising progress in past decades. Most of
the existing approaches focus on learning target representation in
well-conditioned daytime data, while for the unconstrained real-world scenarios
with adverse weather conditions, e.g. nighttime or foggy environment, the
tremendous domain shift leads to significant performance degradation. In this
paper, we propose UMDATrack, which is capable of maintaining high-quality
target state prediction under various adverse weather conditions within a
unified domain adaptation framework. Specifically, we first use a controllable
scenario generator to synthesize a small amount of unlabeled videos (less than
2% frames in source daytime datasets) in multiple weather conditions under the
guidance of different text prompts. Afterwards, we design a simple yet
effective domain-customized adapter (DCA), allowing the target objects'
representation to rapidly adapt to various weather conditions without redundant
model updating. Furthermore, to enhance the localization consistency between
source and target domains, we propose a target-aware confidence alignment
module (TCA) following optimal transport theorem. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that UMDATrack can surpass existing advanced visual trackers and
lead new state-of-the-art performance by a significant margin. Our code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LoD-Loc v2是一种新颖的空中视觉定位方法，适用于低细节（LoD1）城市模型，通过粗到细的策略和显式轮廓对齐实现高精度定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖高细节（LoD3或LoD2）城市模型，但全球范围内多数可用或计划建设的模型为低细节（LoD1），限制了无人机在全球城市定位中的应用。

Method: LoD-Loc v2采用粗到细策略：首先通过建筑分割网络提取轮廓，然后在粗姿态选择阶段构建姿态成本体积，最后通过粒子滤波和多光束跟踪优化姿态。

Result: 实验表明，LoD-Loc v2在高细节模型上提升了精度，首次实现了低细节模型的定位，且性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LoD-Loc v2扩展了定位模型的适用范围，提升了精度和鲁棒性，为无人机全球城市定位提供了新可能。

Abstract: We propose a novel method for aerial visual localization over low
Level-of-Detail (LoD) city models. Previous wireframe-alignment-based method
LoD-Loc has shown promising localization results leveraging LoD models.
However, LoD-Loc mainly relies on high-LoD (LoD3 or LoD2) city models, but the
majority of available models and those many countries plan to construct
nationwide are low-LoD (LoD1). Consequently, enabling localization on low-LoD
city models could unlock drones' potential for global urban localization. To
address these issues, we introduce LoD-Loc v2, which employs a coarse-to-fine
strategy using explicit silhouette alignment to achieve accurate localization
over low-LoD city models in the air. Specifically, given a query image, LoD-Loc
v2 first applies a building segmentation network to shape building silhouettes.
Then, in the coarse pose selection stage, we construct a pose cost volume by
uniformly sampling pose hypotheses around a prior pose to represent the pose
probability distribution. Each cost of the volume measures the degree of
alignment between the projected and predicted silhouettes. We select the pose
with maximum value as the coarse pose. In the fine pose estimation stage, a
particle filtering method incorporating a multi-beam tracking approach is used
to efficiently explore the hypothesis space and obtain the final pose
estimation. To further facilitate research in this field, we release two
datasets with LoD1 city models covering 10.7 km , along with real RGB queries
and ground-truth pose annotations. Experimental results show that LoD-Loc v2
improves estimation accuracy with high-LoD models and enables localization with
low-LoD models for the first time. Moreover, it outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines by large margins, even surpassing texture-model-based methods, and
broadens the convergence basin to accommodate larger prior errors.

Abstract: Accepted in the ICIP 2025
  We present a novel transformer-based framework for whole-body grasping that
addresses both pose generation and motion infilling, enabling realistic and
stable object interactions. Our pipeline comprises three stages: Grasp Pose
Generation for full-body grasp generation, Temporal Infilling for smooth motion
continuity, and a LiftUp Transformer that refines downsampled joints back to
high-resolution markers. To overcome the scarcity of hand-object interaction
data, we introduce a data-efficient Generalized Pretraining stage on large,
diverse motion datasets, yielding robust spatio-temporal representations
transferable to grasping tasks. Experiments on the GRAB dataset show that our
method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of coherence, stability,
and visual realism. The modular design also supports easy adaptation to other
human-motion applications.

Motivation: 现有对抗攻击方法在点云上施加严格几何约束，限制了可转移性和不可防御性；而现有非结构化变形方法可能导致不自然的扭曲。

Method: 构建目标对象的笼形结构，通过扰动笼形顶点实现平滑、自然的点云变形，确保变形内在且合理。

Result: 在三个数据集上的七个3D深度神经网络分类器上，CageAttack在可转移性、不可防御性和合理性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CageAttack通过结构化变形实现了更自然的对抗点云生成，为对抗攻击提供了新思路。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks on point clouds often impose strict geometric constraints
to preserve plausibility; however, such constraints inherently limit
transferability and undefendability. While deformation offers an alternative,
existing unstructured approaches may introduce unnatural distortions, making
adversarial point clouds conspicuous and undermining their plausibility. In
this paper, we propose CageAttack, a cage-based deformation framework that
produces natural adversarial point clouds. It first constructs a cage around
the target object, providing a structured basis for smooth, natural-looking
deformation. Perturbations are then applied to the cage vertices, which
seamlessly propagate to the point cloud, ensuring that the resulting
deformations remain intrinsic to the object and preserve plausibility.
Extensive experiments on seven 3D deep neural network classifiers across three
datasets show that CageAttack achieves a superior balance among
transferability, undefendability, and plausibility, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods. Codes will be made public upon acceptance.

Motivation: 线性注意力虽然复杂度低，但性能显著低于标准Softmax Attention。研究发现其忽略了查询的幅度信息，导致注意力分布无法动态适应查询的变化。

Method: 提出MALA方法，改进线性注意力的计算方式，充分纳入查询的幅度信息，使其注意力分布更接近Softmax Attention。

Result: MALA在多个任务（如图像分类、目标检测、NLP等）中表现优异，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: MALA通过引入查询的幅度信息，显著提升了线性注意力的性能，同时保持了低复杂度的优势。

Abstract: As the core operator of Transformers, Softmax Attention exhibits excellent
global modeling capabilities. However, its quadratic complexity limits its
applicability to vision tasks. In contrast, Linear Attention shares a similar
formulation with Softmax Attention while achieving linear complexity, enabling
efficient global information modeling. Nevertheless, Linear Attention suffers
from a significant performance degradation compared to standard Softmax
Attention. In this paper, we analyze the underlying causes of this issue based
on the formulation of Linear Attention. We find that, unlike Softmax Attention,
Linear Attention entirely disregards the magnitude information of the Query.
This prevents the attention score distribution from dynamically adapting as the
Query scales. As a result, despite its structural similarity to Softmax
Attention, Linear Attention exhibits a significantly different attention score
distribution. Based on this observation, we propose Magnitude-Aware Linear
Attention (MALA), which modifies the computation of Linear Attention to fully
incorporate the Query's magnitude. This adjustment allows MALA to generate an
attention score distribution that closely resembles Softmax Attention while
exhibiting a more well-balanced structure. We evaluate the effectiveness of
MALA on multiple tasks, including image classification, object detection,
instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, natural language processing,
speech recognition, and image generation. Our MALA achieves strong results on
all of these tasks. Code will be available at https://github.com/qhfan/MALA

Abstract: Multi-view image generation in autonomous driving demands consistent 3D scene
understanding across camera views. Most existing methods treat this problem as
a 2D image set generation task, lacking explicit 3D modeling. However, we argue
that a structured representation is crucial for scene generation, especially
for autonomous driving applications. This paper proposes BEV-VAE for consistent
and controllable view synthesis. BEV-VAE first trains a multi-view image
variational autoencoder for a compact and unified BEV latent space and then
generates the scene with a latent diffusion transformer. BEV-VAE supports
arbitrary view generation given camera configurations, and optionally 3D
layouts. Experiments on nuScenes and Argoverse 2 (AV2) show strong performance
in both 3D consistent reconstruction and generation. The code is available at:

Abstract: Recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have introduced a new paradigm
for understanding and reasoning about image input through textual responses.
Although they have achieved remarkable performance across a range of
multi-modal tasks, they face the persistent challenge of hallucination, which
introduces practical weaknesses and raises concerns about their reliable
deployment in real-world applications. Existing work has explored contrastive
decoding approaches to mitigate this issue, where the output of the original
LVLM is compared and contrasted with that of a perturbed version. However,
these methods require two or more queries that slow down LVLM response
generation, making them less suitable for real-time applications. To overcome
this limitation, we propose ONLY, a training-free decoding approach that
requires only a single query and a one-layer intervention during decoding,
enabling efficient real-time deployment. Specifically, we enhance textual
outputs by selectively amplifying crucial textual information using a
text-to-visual entropy ratio for each token. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that our proposed ONLY consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
methods across various benchmarks while requiring minimal implementation effort
and computational cost. Code is available at https://github.com/zifuwan/ONLY.

Conclusion: TopoStreamer通过改进时序一致性和位置编码，显著提升了车道段拓扑推理的准确性，为自动驾驶系统提供了更可靠的道路网络信息。

Abstract: Lane segment topology reasoning constructs a comprehensive road network by
capturing the topological relationships between lane segments and their
semantic types. This enables end-to-end autonomous driving systems to perform
road-dependent maneuvers such as turning and lane changing. However, the
limitations in consistent positional embedding and temporal multiple attribute
learning in existing methods hinder accurate roadnet reconstruction. To address
these issues, we propose TopoStreamer, an end-to-end temporal perception model
for lane segment topology reasoning. Specifically, TopoStreamer introduces
three key improvements: streaming attribute constraints, dynamic lane boundary
positional encoding, and lane segment denoising. The streaming attribute
constraints enforce temporal consistency in both centerline and boundary
coordinates, along with their classifications. Meanwhile, dynamic lane boundary
positional encoding enhances the learning of up-to-date positional information
within queries, while lane segment denoising helps capture diverse lane segment
patterns, ultimately improving model performance. Additionally, we assess the
accuracy of existing models using a lane boundary classification metric, which
serves as a crucial measure for lane-changing scenarios in autonomous driving.
On the OpenLane-V2 dataset, TopoStreamer demonstrates significant improvements
over state-of-the-art methods, achieving substantial performance gains of +3.4%
mAP in lane segment perception and +2.1% OLS in centerline perception tasks.

Motivation: 零样本域适应（ZSDA）因目标域缺乏图像而具有挑战性，现有方法依赖手动设计的提示，忽略了检测任务与视觉语言模型之间的不对齐。

Method: 提出UPRE框架，结合多视图域提示和视觉表示增强模块，并采用多级增强策略（如相对域距离和正负分离）。

Result: 在九个基准数据集上的实验表明，UPRE在ZSDA检测场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: UPRE通过优化提示和表示，显著提升了零样本域适应的性能。

Abstract: Zero-shot domain adaptation (ZSDA) presents substantial challenges due to the
lack of images in the target domain. Previous approaches leverage
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to tackle this challenge, exploiting their
zero-shot learning capabilities. However, these methods primarily address
domain distribution shifts and overlook the misalignment between the detection
task and VLMs, which rely on manually crafted prompts. To overcome these
limitations, we propose the unified prompt and representation enhancement
(UPRE) framework, which jointly optimizes both textual prompts and visual
representations. Specifically, our approach introduces a multi-view domain
prompt that combines linguistic domain priors with detection-specific
knowledge, and a visual representation enhancement module that produces domain
style variations. Furthermore, we introduce multi-level enhancement strategies,
including relative domain distance and positive-negative separation, which
align multi-modal representations at the image level and capture diverse visual
representations at the instance level, respectively. Extensive experiments
conducted on nine benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of
our framework in ZSDA detection scenarios. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有防御方法针对从头训练的模型设计，对微调模型可能无效或引入风险，因此需要一种更安全的验证方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为个性化模型提供了一种安全、鲁棒的所有权验证解决方案。

Abstract: Large vision models achieve remarkable performance in various downstream
tasks, primarily by personalizing pre-trained models through fine-tuning with
private and valuable local data, which makes the personalized model a valuable
intellectual property for its owner. Similar to the era of traditional DNNs,
model stealing attacks also pose significant risks to these personalized
models. However, in this paper, we reveal that most existing defense methods
(developed for traditional DNNs), typically designed for models trained from
scratch, either introduce additional security risks, are prone to misjudgment,
or are even ineffective for fine-tuned models. To alleviate these problems,
this paper proposes a harmless model ownership verification method for
personalized models by decoupling similar common features. In general, our
method consists of three main stages. In the first stage, we create shadow
models that retain common features of the victim model while disrupting
dataset-specific features. We represent the dataset-specific features of the
victim model by the output differences between the shadow and victim models.
After that, a meta-classifier is trained to identify stolen models by
determining whether suspicious models contain the dataset-specific features of
the victim. In the third stage, we conduct model ownership verification by
hypothesis test to mitigate randomness and enhance robustness. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed
method in detecting different types of model stealing simultaneously.

Abstract: This work introduces a novel biorthogonal tunable wavelet unit constructed
using a lifting scheme that relaxes both the orthogonality and equal filter
length constraints, providing greater flexibility in filter design. The
proposed unit enhances convolution, pooling, and downsampling operations,
leading to improved image classification and anomaly detection in convolutional

and on the Describable Textures Dataset (DTD) by 9.73%, demonstrating its
effectiveness in capturing fine-grained details. Similar improvements were
observed in ResNet-34. For anomaly detection in the hazelnut category of the

wellbalanced performance in both segmentation and detection tasks,
outperforming existing approaches in terms of accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at visual grounding
in single-image scenarios with textual references. However, their performance
degrades when handling real-world applications involving complex multi-image
compositions and multimodal instructions, which reveals limitations in
cross-image reasoning and generalization. To address these challenges, we adopt
a Reinforcement Learning (RL) based post-training strategy to improve the
reasoning performance of MLLMs in multi-image grounding tasks. Our approach
begins with synthesizing high-quality chain-of-thought (CoT) data for
cold-start initialization, followed by supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using
low-rank adaptation (LoRA). The cold-start training stage enables the model to
identify correct solutions. Subsequently, we perform rejection sampling using
the merged SFT model to curate high-quality RL data and leverage rule-based RL
to guide the model toward optimal reasoning paths. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving +9.04\%
improvements on MIG-Bench and +4.98\% improvements on several out-of-domain
reasoning grounding benchmarks over the SFT baseline. Furthermore, our approach
exhibits strong generalization in multi-image perception, with gains of +3.1\%
and +2.4\% over the base model on subsets of the BLINK and MMIU benchmarks,
respectively.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态图卷积网络（MMGCN），通过整合低帧率视觉数据和高帧率运动数据，减少动作分割中的过分割错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在协作环境中，机器人需要精确理解人类动作的子活动标签及其时间结构，但现有方法因噪声问题容易导致过分割。

Method: 采用正弦编码策略增强空间表示，设计时间图融合模块对齐多模态输入，并提出数据增强技术SmoothLabelMix以提升时间一致性。

Result: 在Bimanual Actions Dataset上表现优异，F1@10为94.5%，F1@25为92.8%。

Conclusion: MMGCN通过多模态融合和数据增强，显著提升了动作分割的准确性和时间一致性。

Abstract: Accurate temporal segmentation of human actions is critical for intelligent
robots in collaborative settings, where a precise understanding of sub-activity
labels and their temporal structure is essential. However, the inherent noise
in both human pose estimation and object detection often leads to
over-segmentation errors, disrupting the coherence of action sequences. To
address this, we propose a Multi-Modal Graph Convolutional Network (MMGCN) that
integrates low-frame-rate (e.g., 1 fps) visual data with high-frame-rate (e.g.,
30 fps) motion data (skeleton and object detections) to mitigate fragmentation.
Our framework introduces three key contributions. First, a sinusoidal encoding
strategy that maps 3D skeleton coordinates into a continuous sin-cos space to
enhance spatial representation robustness. Second, a temporal graph fusion
module that aligns multi-modal inputs with differing resolutions via
hierarchical feature aggregation, Third, inspired by the smooth transitions
inherent to human actions, we design SmoothLabelMix, a data augmentation
technique that mixes input sequences and labels to generate synthetic training
examples with gradual action transitions, enhancing temporal consistency in
predictions and reducing over-segmentation artifacts.
  Extensive experiments on the Bimanual Actions Dataset, a public benchmark for
human-object interaction understanding, demonstrate that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in action segmentation
accuracy, achieving F1@10: 94.5% and F1@25: 92.8%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs与ViTs的直接融合存在模态不匹配问题，导致LLMs潜力未充分发挥且微调不稳定。

Method: 采用MAE预训练ViT以增强视觉表示，同时使用LoRA层在LLM块中通过MAE目标进行训练。

Result: LUViT在多种下游视觉任务中表现出显著性能提升。

Conclusion: LUViT为利用LLM知识进行视觉理解提供了更有效和高效的途径。

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Model (LLMs) blocks with Vision
Transformers (ViTs) holds immense promise for vision-only tasks by leveraging
the rich semantic knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLMs. However, a
fundamental challenge lies in the inherent modality mismatch between
text-centric pretraining of LLMs and vision-centric training of ViTs. Direct
fusion often fails to fully exploit the LLM's potential and suffers from
unstable finetuning. As a result, LLM blocks are kept frozen while only the
vision components are learned. As a remedy to these challenges, we introduce
Language-Unlocked Vision Transformers (LUViT), a novel approach that bridges
this modality mismatch through a synergistic pre-training strategy. LUViT
co-adapts a ViT backbone and an LLM fusion block by (1) employing Masked
Auto-Encoding (MAE) to pre-train the ViT for richer visual representations, and
(2) concurrently training Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) layers within the LLM
block using the MAE objective. This joint optimization guides the ViT to
produce LLM-aligned features and the LLM to effectively interpret visual
information. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that LUViT
significantly improves performance on various downstream vision tasks,
showcasing a more effective and efficient pathway to harness LLM knowledge for
visual understanding.

Abstract: Human-object interaction segmentation is a fundamental task of daily activity
understanding, which plays a crucial role in applications such as assistive
robotics, healthcare, and autonomous systems. Most existing learning-based
methods excel in closed-world action segmentation, they struggle to generalize
to open-world scenarios where novel actions emerge. Collecting exhaustive
action categories for training is impractical due to the dynamic diversity of
human activities, necessitating models that detect and segment
out-of-distribution actions without manual annotation. To address this issue,
we formally define the open-world action segmentation problem and propose a
structured framework for detecting and segmenting unseen actions. Our framework
introduces three key innovations: 1) an Enhanced Pyramid Graph Convolutional
Network (EPGCN) with a novel decoder module for robust spatiotemporal feature
upsampling. 2) Mixup-based training to synthesize out-of-distribution data,
eliminating reliance on manual annotations. 3) A novel Temporal Clustering loss
that groups in-distribution actions while distancing out-of-distribution
samples.
  We evaluate our framework on two challenging human-object interaction
recognition datasets: Bimanual Actions and 2 Hands and Object (H2O) datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art
action segmentation models across multiple open-set evaluation metrics,
achieving 16.9% and 34.6% relative gains in open-set segmentation (F1@50) and
out-of-distribution detection performances (AUROC), respectively. Additionally,
we conduct an in-depth ablation study to assess the impact of each proposed
component, identifying the optimal framework configuration for open-world
action segmentation.

Motivation: 解决现有方法在计算开销和语义保真度之间的权衡问题。

Method: 1. 分布感知噪声优化模块；2. 硬件高效的令牌剪枝策略。

Result: 在基准数据集上实现最优的提示-图像一致性，显著降低计算成本。

Conclusion: OptiPrune同时解决了语义对齐和效率问题，适用于资源受限硬件。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models often struggle to achieve accurate semantic
alignment between generated images and text prompts while maintaining
efficiency for deployment on resource-constrained hardware. Existing approaches
either incur substantial computational overhead through noise optimization or
compromise semantic fidelity by aggressively pruning tokens. In this work, we
propose OptiPrune, a unified framework that combines distribution-aware initial
noise optimization with similarity-based token pruning to address both
challenges simultaneously. Specifically, (1) we introduce a distribution-aware
noise optimization module guided by attention scores to steer the initial
latent noise toward semantically meaningful regions, mitigating issues such as
subject neglect and feature entanglement; (2) we design a hardware-efficient
token pruning strategy that selects representative base tokens via patch-wise
similarity, injects randomness to enhance generalization, and recovers pruned
tokens using maximum similarity copying before attention operations. Our method
preserves the Gaussian prior during noise optimization and enables efficient
inference without sacrificing alignment quality. Experiments on benchmark
datasets, including Animal-Animal, demonstrate that OptiPrune achieves
state-of-the-art prompt-image consistency with significantly reduced
computational cost.

Abstract: Unified image restoration is a significantly challenging task in low-level
vision. Existing methods either make tailored designs for specific tasks,
limiting their generalizability across various types of degradation, or rely on
training with paired datasets, thereby suffering from closed-set constraints.
To address these issues, we propose a novel, dataset-free, and unified approach
through recurrent posterior sampling utilizing a pretrained latent diffusion
model. Our method incorporates the multimodal understanding model to provide
sematic priors for the generative model under a task-blind condition.
Furthermore, it utilizes a lightweight module to align the degraded input with
the generated preference of the diffusion model, and employs recurrent
refinement for posterior sampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, validating its effectiveness and
robustness. Our code and data will be available at

Abstract: Generating accurate and realistic virtual human movements in real-time is of
high importance for a variety of applications in computer graphics, interactive
virtual environments, robotics, and biomechanics. This paper introduces a novel
real-time inverse kinematics (IK) solver specifically designed for realistic
human-like movement generation. Leveraging the automatic differentiation and
just-in-time compilation of TensorFlow, the proposed solver efficiently handles
complex articulated human skeletons with high degrees of freedom. By treating
forward and inverse kinematics as differentiable operations, our method
effectively addresses common challenges such as error accumulation and
complicated joint limits in multi-constrained problems, which are critical for
realistic human motion modeling. We demonstrate the solver's effectiveness on
the SMPLX human skeleton model, evaluating its performance against widely used
iterative-based IK algorithms, like Cyclic Coordinate Descent (CCD), FABRIK,
and the nonlinear optimization algorithm IPOPT. Our experiments cover both
simple end-effector tasks and sophisticated, multi-constrained problems with
realistic joint limits. Results indicate that our IK solver achieves real-time

Abstract: 3D medical image generation is essential for data augmentation and patient
privacy, calling for reliable and efficient models suited for clinical
practice. However, current methods suffer from limited anatomical fidelity,
restricted axial length, and substantial computational cost, placing them
beyond reach for regions with limited resources and infrastructure. We
introduce TRACE, a framework that generates 3D medical images with
spatiotemporal alignment using a 2D multimodal-conditioned diffusion approach.
TRACE models sequential 2D slices as video frame pairs, combining segmentation
priors and radiology reports for anatomical alignment, incorporating optical
flow to sustain temporal coherence. During inference, an overlapping-frame
strategy links frame pairs into a flexible length sequence, reconstructed into
a spatiotemporally and anatomically aligned 3D volume. Experimental results
demonstrate that TRACE effectively balances computational efficiency with
preserving anatomical fidelity and spatiotemporal consistency. Code is

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著优于现有攻击方法，平均提升22.8%，并在图像理解任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: CAVALRY-V为多模态系统的对抗研究提供了基础性方法。

Abstract: Video Multimodal Large Language Models (V-MLLMs) have shown impressive
capabilities in temporal reasoning and cross-modal understanding, yet their
vulnerability to adversarial attacks remains underexplored due to unique
challenges: complex cross-modal reasoning mechanisms, temporal dependencies,
and computational constraints. We present CAVALRY-V (Cross-modal
Language-Vision Adversarial Yielding for Videos), a novel framework that
directly targets the critical interface between visual perception and language
generation in V-MLLMs. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (1) a
dual-objective semantic-visual loss function that simultaneously disrupts the
model's text generation logits and visual representations to undermine
cross-modal integration, and (2) a computationally efficient two-stage
generator framework that combines large-scale pre-training for cross-model
transferability with specialized fine-tuning for spatiotemporal coherence.
Empirical evaluation on comprehensive video understanding benchmarks
demonstrates that CAVALRY-V significantly outperforms existing attack methods,
achieving 22.8% average improvement over the best baseline attacks on both
commercial systems (GPT-4.1, Gemini 2.0) and open-source models (QwenVL-2.5,
InternVL-2.5, Llava-Video, Aria, MiniCPM-o-2.6). Our framework achieves
flexibility through implicit temporal coherence modeling rather than explicit
regularization, enabling significant performance improvements even on image
understanding (34.4% average gain). This capability demonstrates CAVALRY-V's
potential as a foundational approach for adversarial research across multimodal
systems.

Abstract: Accurate particle size distribution (PSD) measurement is important in
industries such as mining, pharmaceuticals, and fertilizer manufacturing,
significantly influencing product quality and operational efficiency.
Traditional PSD methods like sieve analysis and laser diffraction are manual,
time-consuming, and limited by particle overlap. Recent developments in
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) enable automated, real-time PSD estimation
directly from particle images. In this work, we present a CNN-based methodology
trained on realistic synthetic particle imagery generated using Blender's
advanced rendering capabilities. Synthetic data sets using this method can
replicate various industrial scenarios by systematically varying particle
shapes, textures, lighting, and spatial arrangements that closely resemble the
actual configurations. We evaluated three CNN-based architectures, ResNet-50,
InceptionV3, and EfficientNet-B0, for predicting critical PSD parameters (d10,
d50, d90). Results demonstrated comparable accuracy across models, with
EfficientNet-B0 achieving the best computational efficiency suitable for
real-time industrial deployment. This approach shows the effectiveness of
realistic synthetic data for robust CNN training, which offers significant
potential for automated industrial PSD monitoring. The code is released at :

Result: 在VisDrone数据集上，AP$_{50}$提升5.1%，AP提升3.8%，同时保持实时速度和减少参数。

Conclusion: HEGS-DETR有效解决了无人机图像检测的特定问题，性能显著优于基线方法。

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle-based Object Detection (UAV-OD) faces substantial
challenges, including small target sizes, high-density distributions, and
cluttered backgrounds in UAV imagery. Current algorithms often depend on
hand-crafted components like anchor boxes, which demand fine-tuning and exhibit
limited generalization, and Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS), which is
threshold-sensitive and prone to misclassifying dense objects. These generic
architectures thus struggle to adapt to aerial imaging characteristics,
resulting in performance limitations. Moreover, emerging end-to-end frameworks
have yet to effectively mitigate these aerial-specific challenges.To address
these issues, we propose HEGS-DETR, a comprehensively enhanced, real-time
Detection Transformer framework tailored for UAVs. First, we introduce the
High-Frequency Enhanced Semantics Network (HFESNet) as a novel backbone.
HFESNet preserves critical high-frequency spatial details to extract robust
semantic features, thereby improving discriminative capability for small and
occluded targets in complex backgrounds. Second, our Efficient Small Object
Pyramid (ESOP) strategy strategically fuses high-resolution feature maps with
minimal computational overhead, significantly boosting small object detection.
Finally, the proposed Selective Query Recollection (SQR) and Geometry-Aware
Positional Encoding (GAPE) modules enhance the detector's decoder stability and
localization accuracy, effectively optimizing bounding boxes and providing
explicit spatial priors for dense scenes. Experiments on the VisDrone dataset
demonstrate that HEGS-DETR achieves a 5.1\% AP$_{50}$ and 3.8\% AP increase
over the baseline, while maintaining real-time speed and reducing parameter
count by 4M.

Motivation: 降水临近预报对天气敏感行业至关重要，现有深度学习模型多依赖2D雷达反射率，忽略了3D雷达数据中的垂直信息。研究旨在评估ETH作为辅助变量对预报性能的潜在贡献。

Method: 采用单通道3D U-Net模型，同时处理雷达反射率和ETH作为输入通道，分析ETH与雷达反射率的关系及其对降雨强度预测的影响。

Conclusion: 研究为评估额外变量对临近预报性能的潜在贡献提供了基础，但需进一步探索ETH在高雨强下的适用性。

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting -- the short-term prediction of rainfall using
recent radar observations -- is critical for weather-sensitive sectors such as
transportation, agriculture, and disaster mitigation. While recent deep
learning models have shown promise in improving nowcasting skill, most
approaches rely solely on 2D radar reflectivity fields, discarding valuable
vertical information available in the full 3D radar volume. In this work, we
explore the use of Echo Top Height (ETH), a 2D projection indicating the
maximum altitude of radar reflectivity above a given threshold, as an auxiliary
input variable for deep learning-based nowcasting. We examine the relationship
between ETH and radar reflectivity, confirming its relevance for predicting
rainfall intensity. We implement a single-pass 3D U-Net that processes both the
radar reflectivity and ETH as separate input channels. While our models are
able to leverage ETH to improve skill at low rain-rate thresholds, results are
inconsistent at higher intensities and the models with ETH systematically
underestimate precipitation intensity. Three case studies are used to
illustrate how ETH can help in some cases, but also confuse the models and
increase the error variance. Nonetheless, the study serves as a foundation for
critically assessing the potential contribution of additional variables to
nowcasting performance.

Method: 设计了Deformable Token Mamba Block (DTMB) 生成可变形令牌，并采用多模态特征融合和多尺度特征提取策略。

Result: 在DroneVehicle数据集上，mAP指标比基线OAFA方法提高了3.6%。

Conclusion: UAVD-Mamba框架在多模态无人机目标检测中表现出色，代码将开源。

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) object detection has been widely used in
traffic management, agriculture, emergency rescue, etc. However, it faces
significant challenges, including occlusions, small object sizes, and irregular
shapes. These challenges highlight the necessity for a robust and efficient
multimodal UAV object detection method. Mamba has demonstrated considerable
potential in multimodal image fusion. Leveraging this, we propose UAVD-Mamba, a
multimodal UAV object detection framework based on Mamba architectures. To
improve geometric adaptability, we propose the Deformable Token Mamba Block
(DTMB) to generate deformable tokens by incorporating adaptive patches from
deformable convolutions alongside normal patches from normal convolutions,
which serve as the inputs to the Mamba Block. To optimize the multimodal
feature complementarity, we design two separate DTMBs for the RGB and infrared
(IR) modalities, with the outputs from both DTMBs integrated into the Mamba
Block for feature extraction and into the Fusion Mamba Block for feature
fusion. Additionally, to improve multiscale object detection, especially for
small objects, we stack four DTMBs at different scales to produce multiscale
feature representations, which are then sent to the Detection Neck for Mamba
(DNM). The DNM module, inspired by the YOLO series, includes modifications to
the SPPF and C3K2 of YOLOv11 to better handle the multiscale features. In
particular, we employ cross-enhanced spatial attention before the DTMB and
cross-channel attention after the Fusion Mamba Block to extract more
discriminative features. Experimental results on the DroneVehicle dataset show
that our method outperforms the baseline OAFA method by 3.6% in the mAP metric.
Codes will be released at https://github.com/GreatPlum-hnu/UAVD-Mamba.git.

handling objects in unstructured environments without rigid positioning
constraints. This paper presents a computer vision system that enables
industrial robots to detect and grasp pen components in arbitrary orientations
without requiring structured trays, while maintaining robust performance under

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SafeMap是一种新颖的框架，用于在部分相机视角缺失的情况下构建高精度HD地图，通过G-PVR和D-BEVC模块实现鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多视角相机数据不完整时表现不佳，影响自动驾驶的HD地图构建。

Method: SafeMap结合G-PVR模块（基于高斯模型动态优先处理关键区域）和D-BEVC模块（利用全景BEV特征校正不完整观测）。

Result: 实验表明，SafeMap在完整和不完整数据场景下均显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SafeMap提供了一种即插即用的鲁棒解决方案，适用于自动驾驶中的HD地图构建。

Abstract: Robust high-definition (HD) map construction is vital for autonomous driving,
yet existing methods often struggle with incomplete multi-view camera data.
This paper presents SafeMap, a novel framework specifically designed to secure
accuracy even when certain camera views are missing. SafeMap integrates two key
components: the Gaussian-based Perspective View Reconstruction (G-PVR) module
and the Distillation-based Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) Correction (D-BEVC) module.
G-PVR leverages prior knowledge of view importance to dynamically prioritize
the most informative regions based on the relationships among available camera
views. Furthermore, D-BEVC utilizes panoramic BEV features to correct the BEV
representations derived from incomplete observations. Together, these
components facilitate the end-to-end map reconstruction and robust HD map
generation. SafeMap is easy to implement and integrates seamlessly into
existing systems, offering a plug-and-play solution for enhanced robustness.
Experimental results demonstrate that SafeMap significantly outperforms
previous methods in both complete and incomplete scenarios, highlighting its
superior performance and reliability.

TL;DR: 探索视觉上下文学习的潜力，使单一模型能处理多任务并在测试时适应新任务，无需重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂任务，允许用户在测试时灵活定义整个视觉流程，而非仅适应单个任务。

Method: 研究视觉上下文学习架构的特性与限制，提出基于合成组合任务生成引擎的新训练方法，并探索掩码训练目标。

Result: 为多模态医疗任务序列提供重要见解，同时揭示需解决的挑战。

Conclusion: 视觉上下文学习在复杂任务中具有潜力，但仍需进一步研究以克服现有挑战。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the potential of visual in-context learning to
enable a single model to handle multiple tasks and adapt to new tasks during
test time without re-training. Unlike previous approaches, our focus is on
training in-context learners to adapt to sequences of tasks, rather than
individual tasks. Our goal is to solve complex tasks that involve multiple
intermediate steps using a single model, allowing users to define entire vision
pipelines flexibly at test time. To achieve this, we first examine the
properties and limitations of visual in-context learning architectures, with a
particular focus on the role of codebooks. We then introduce a novel method for
training in-context learners using a synthetic compositional task generation
engine. This engine bootstraps task sequences from arbitrary segmentation
datasets, enabling the training of visual in-context learners for compositional
tasks. Additionally, we investigate different masking-based training objectives
to gather insights into how to train models better for solving complex,
compositional tasks. Our exploration not only provides important insights
especially for multi-modal medical task sequences but also highlights
challenges that need to be addressed.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于3D高斯泼溅的场景中心3D视觉语言模型，通过语言和任务感知的场景表示，解决了现有方法对物体检测器的依赖问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D视觉语言模型对物体检测器依赖性强，导致处理瓶颈和分类灵活性受限。

Method: 直接嵌入语言特征到3D场景表示中，通过任务和位置引导的双重稀疏化器生成紧凑的任务相关令牌。

Result: 在域外设置中，性能提升至现有3D VLM的五倍。

Conclusion: 该方法通过高斯泼溅技术实现了高效的3D场景理解和语言对齐，具有强泛化能力。

Abstract: As multimodal language models advance, their application to 3D scene
understanding is a fast-growing frontier, driving the development of 3D
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Current methods show strong dependence on object
detectors, introducing processing bottlenecks and limitations in taxonomic
flexibility. To address these limitations, we propose a scene-centric 3D VLM
for 3D Gaussian splat scenes that employs language- and task-aware scene
representations. Our approach directly embeds rich linguistic features into the
3D scene representation by associating language with each Gaussian primitive,
achieving early modality alignment. To process the resulting dense
representations, we introduce a dual sparsifier that distills them into
compact, task-relevant tokens via task-guided and location-guided pathways,
producing sparse, task-aware global and local scene tokens. Notably, we present
the first Gaussian splatting-based VLM, leveraging photorealistic 3D
representations derived from standard RGB images, demonstrating strong
generalization: it improves performance of prior 3D VLM five folds, in
out-of-the-domain settings.

TL;DR: Image2GS提出了一种从单图像重建逼真3D场景的新方法，专注于图像到3D的提升问题，通过掩码训练策略显著提升可见区域的重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从单图像重建3D场景的挑战，特别是图像到3D的提升问题，避免生成不可见区域的内容。

Method: 使用优化的3D高斯斑点生成的可见性掩码，在训练中排除不可见区域，专注于可见区域的提升。

Result: 在可见区域的重建质量显著优于基线方法，且与完整场景训练的先进模型竞争。

Conclusion: Image2GS展示了将图像到3D提升作为独立问题处理的优势，揭示了判别模型在拟合不可见区域时的根本挑战。

Abstract: We present Image2GS, a novel approach that addresses the challenging problem
of reconstructing photorealistic 3D scenes from a single image by focusing
specifically on the image-to-3D lifting component of the reconstruction
process. By decoupling the lifting problem (converting an image to a 3D model
representing what is visible) from the completion problem (hallucinating
content not present in the input), we create a more deterministic task suitable
for discriminative models. Our method employs visibility masks derived from
optimized 3D Gaussian splats to exclude areas not visible from the source view
during training. This masked training strategy significantly improves
reconstruction quality in visible regions compared to strong baselines.
Notably, despite being trained only on masked regions, Image2GS remains
competitive with state-of-the-art discriminative models trained on full target
images when evaluated on complete scenes. Our findings highlight the
fundamental struggle discriminative models face when fitting unseen regions and
demonstrate the advantages of addressing image-to-3D lifting as a distinct
problem with specialized techniques.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种利用单张术中图像和术前数据高效训练NeRF的方法，解决了手术场景中多视图数据不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NeRF在3D重建和视图合成方面表现优异，但在手术场景中，由于时间限制无法获取大量多视图数据，因此需要一种基于单张图像的高效训练方法。

Method: 结合术前MRI数据和术中图像，通过神经风格迁移（WTC2和STROTSS）生成训练数据集，实现单图像快速训练NeRF。

Result: 在四个神经外科病例中验证，结果显示高重建保真度和风格一致性，与真实显微镜图像训练的NeRF模型相比表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了在手术场景中单图像训练NeRF的可行性，突破了传统多视图方法的限制。

Abstract: Purpose: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) offer exceptional capabilities for 3D
reconstruction and view synthesis, yet their reliance on extensive multi-view
data limits their application in surgical intraoperative settings where only
limited data is available. In particular, collecting such extensive data
intraoperatively is impractical due to time constraints. This work addresses
this challenge by leveraging a single intraoperative image and preoperative
data to train NeRF efficiently for surgical scenarios.
  Methods: We leverage preoperative MRI data to define the set of camera
viewpoints and images needed for robust and unobstructed training.
Intraoperatively, the appearance of the surgical image is transferred to the
pre-constructed training set through neural style transfer, specifically
combining WTC2 and STROTSS to prevent over-stylization. This process enables
the creation of a dataset for instant and fast single-image NeRF training.
  Results: The method is evaluated with four clinical neurosurgical cases.
Quantitative comparisons to NeRF models trained on real surgical microscope
images demonstrate strong synthesis agreement, with similarity metrics
indicating high reconstruction fidelity and stylistic alignment. When compared
with ground truth, our method demonstrates high structural similarity,
confirming good reconstruction quality and texture preservation.
  Conclusion: Our approach demonstrates the feasibility of single-image NeRF
training in surgical settings, overcoming the limitations of traditional
multi-view methods.

Abstract: While recent online HD mapping methods relieve burdened offline pipelines and
solve map freshness, they remain limited by perceptual inaccuracies, occlusion
in dense traffic, and an inability to fuse multi-agent observations. We propose
RTMap to enhance these single-traversal methods by persistently crowdsourcing a
multi-traversal HD map as a self-evolutional memory. On onboard agents, RTMap
simultaneously addresses three core challenges in an end-to-end fashion: (1)
Uncertainty-aware positional modeling for HD map elements, (2)
probabilistic-aware localization w.r.t. the crowdsourced prior-map, and (3)
real-time detection for possible road structural changes. Experiments on
several public autonomous driving datasets demonstrate our solid performance on
both the prior-aided map quality and the localization accuracy, demonstrating
our effectiveness of robustly serving downstream prediction and planning
modules while gradually improving the accuracy and freshness of the
crowdsourced prior-map asynchronously. Our source-code will be made publicly
available at https://github.com/CN-ADLab/RTMap (Camera ready version
incorporating reviewer suggestions will be updated soon).

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed substantial progress on monocular depth

complete assessment, because most evaluate accuracy but not robustness. In this
work, we introduce PDE (Procedural Depth Evaluation), a new benchmark which
enables systematic robustness evaluation. PDE uses procedural generation to
create 3D scenes that test robustness to various controlled perturbations,
including object, camera, material and lighting changes. Our analysis yields
interesting findings on what perturbations are challenging for state-of-the-art

Motivation: 现有文本生成方法在视觉文本渲染中存在模糊字形、语义漂移和风格控制有限的问题，且依赖预渲染字形图像导致模型复杂性和灵活性降低。

Method: 采用分割引导框架，结合双语分割模型提取精确文本掩码，并改进扩散模型以增强字形条件和区域特定损失，保留文本内容和风格。

Conclusion: 该方法在文本生成任务中具有强泛化能力和部署准备性，为视觉文本渲染提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image generation has greatly advanced content creation, yet
accurately rendering visual text remains a key challenge due to blurred glyphs,
semantic drift, and limited style control. Existing methods often rely on
pre-rendered glyph images as conditions, but these struggle to retain original
font styles and color cues, necessitating complex multi-branch designs that
increase model overhead and reduce flexibility. To address these issues, we
propose a segmentation-guided framework that uses pixel-level visual text masks
-- rich in glyph shape, color, and spatial detail -- as unified conditional
inputs. Our method introduces two core components: (1) a fine-tuned bilingual
segmentation model for precise text mask extraction, and (2) a streamlined
diffusion model augmented with adaptive glyph conditioning and a
region-specific loss to preserve textual fidelity in both content and style.
Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the AnyText benchmark,
significantly surpassing prior methods in both Chinese and English settings. To
enable more rigorous evaluation, we also introduce two new benchmarks:
GlyphMM-benchmark for testing layout and glyph consistency in complex
typesetting, and MiniText-benchmark for assessing generation quality in
small-scale text regions. Experimental results show that our model outperforms
existing methods by a large margin in both scenarios, particularly excelling at
small text rendering and complex layout preservation, validating its strong
generalization and deployment readiness.

Motivation: 解决形状量化中提取的测量值对保持物体内在几何的变换（如大小、方向和位置变化）不变的核心挑战。

Method: 提出ShapeEmbed框架，通过自监督学习将欧几里得距离矩阵编码为形状描述符。

Result: 在自然和生物图像形状分类任务中，ShapeEmbed的描述符优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ShapeEmbed在生物成像应用中具有潜在的重要价值。

Abstract: The shape of objects is an important source of visual information in a wide
range of applications. One of the core challenges of shape quantification is to
ensure that the extracted measurements remain invariant to transformations that
preserve an object's intrinsic geometry, such as changing its size,
orientation, and position in the image. In this work, we introduce ShapeEmbed,
a self-supervised representation learning framework designed to encode the
contour of objects in 2D images, represented as a Euclidean distance matrix,
into a shape descriptor that is invariant to translation, scaling, rotation,
reflection, and point indexing. Our approach overcomes the limitations of
traditional shape descriptors while improving upon existing state-of-the-art
autoencoder-based approaches. We demonstrate that the descriptors learned by
our framework outperform their competitors in shape classification tasks on
natural and biological images. We envision our approach to be of particular
relevance to biological imaging applications.

Motivation: 现实世界中的视频超分辨率（VSR）面临复杂且不可预测的退化问题，现有方法难以同时实现时间一致性和高质量细节生成。

Method: 提出DAM-VSR框架，将VSR解耦为外观增强（通过参考图像超分辨率）和运动控制（通过视频ControlNet），并采用运动对齐的双向采样策略。

Result: DAM-VSR在真实世界数据和AIGC数据上实现了最先进的性能，展现了强大的细节生成能力。

Conclusion: DAM-VSR通过解耦外观与运动，充分利用生成模型和超分辨率模型的优势，显著提升了视频超分辨率的效果。

Abstract: Real-world video super-resolution (VSR) presents significant challenges due
to complex and unpredictable degradations. Although some recent methods utilize
image diffusion models for VSR and have shown improved detail generation
capabilities, they still struggle to produce temporally consistent frames. We
attempt to use Stable Video Diffusion (SVD) combined with ControlNet to address
this issue. However, due to the intrinsic image-animation characteristics of
SVD, it is challenging to generate fine details using only low-quality videos.
To tackle this problem, we propose DAM-VSR, an appearance and motion
disentanglement framework for VSR. This framework disentangles VSR into
appearance enhancement and motion control problems. Specifically, appearance
enhancement is achieved through reference image super-resolution, while motion
control is achieved through video ControlNet. This disentanglement fully
leverages the generative prior of video diffusion models and the detail
generation capabilities of image super-resolution models. Furthermore, equipped
with the proposed motion-aligned bidirectional sampling strategy, DAM-VSR can
conduct VSR on longer input videos. DAM-VSR achieves state-of-the-art
performance on real-world data and AIGC data, demonstrating its powerful detail
generation capabilities.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is fueling exponential electricity demand
growth, threatening grid reliability, raising prices for communities paying for
new energy infrastructure, and stunting AI innovation as data centers wait for
interconnection to constrained grids. This paper presents the first field
demonstration, in collaboration with major corporate partners, of a
software-only approach--Emerald Conductor--that transforms AI data centers into
flexible grid resources that can efficiently and immediately harness existing
power systems without massive infrastructure buildout. Conducted at a 256-GPU
cluster running representative AI workloads within a commercial, hyperscale
cloud data center in Phoenix, Arizona, the trial achieved a 25% reduction in
cluster power usage for three hours during peak grid events while maintaining
AI quality of service (QoS) guarantees. By orchestrating AI workloads based on
real-time grid signals without hardware modifications or energy storage, this
platform reimagines data centers as grid-interactive assets that enhance grid
reliability, advance affordability, and accelerate AI's development.

TL;DR: 论文提出HDRAM框架，通过信息论方法解决LLMs中的精度损失问题，结合经典纠错码、全息计算和量子启发搜索，显著提升关联检索能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）存在精度损失问题，作者将其重新定义为信息扩散问题，试图从信息论角度解决。

Method: 引入HDRAM框架，利用超令牌（hypertokens）和相位相干内存地址，结合经典纠错码、全息计算和量子启发搜索，实现高效键值操作和Grover式搜索。

Result: HDRAM显著提升了关联检索能力，且无需改变模型架构。

Conclusion: 通过经典-全息-量子启发（CHQ）原则，HDRAM为Transformer架构提供了新的加固方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities but suffer from
apparent precision loss, reframed here as information spreading. This reframing
shifts the problem from computational precision to an information-theoretic
communication issue. We address the K:V and V:K memory problem in LLMs by
introducing HDRAM (Holographically Defined Random Access Memory), a symbolic
memory framework treating transformer latent space as a spread-spectrum
channel. Built upon hypertokens, structured symbolic codes integrating
classical error-correcting codes (ECC), holographic computing, and
quantum-inspired search, HDRAM recovers distributed information through
principled despreading. These phase-coherent memory addresses enable efficient
key-value operations and Grover-style search in latent space. By combining ECC
grammar with compressed sensing and Krylov subspace alignment, HDRAM
significantly improves associative retrieval without architectural changes,
demonstrating how Classical-Holographic-Quantum-inspired (CHQ) principles can
fortify transformer architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决物联网环境中入侵检测的不确定性问题，提升检测的准确性和可解释性。

Method: 集成随机森林、XGBoost和逻辑回归，结合中性逻辑分解预测置信度，并设置全局和类别特定阈值进行不确定预测的标记。

Result: 在IoT-CAD数据集上达到97%的准确率，不确定成分（I）与错误率显著相关。

Conclusion: 中性逻辑提升了检测的准确性和可解释性，为边缘和雾计算物联网安全系统提供了信任感知的AI基础。

Abstract: This paper presents NeutroSENSE, a neutrosophic-enhanced ensemble framework
for interpretable intrusion detection in IoT environments. By integrating
Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression with neutrosophic logic, the
system decomposes prediction confidence into truth (T), falsity (F), and
indeterminacy (I) components, enabling uncertainty quantification and
abstention. Predictions with high indeterminacy are flagged for review using
both global and adaptive, class-specific thresholds. Evaluated on the IoT-CAD
dataset, NeutroSENSE achieved 97% accuracy, while demonstrating that
misclassified samples exhibit significantly higher indeterminacy (I = 0.62)
than correct ones (I = 0.24). The use of indeterminacy as a proxy for
uncertainty enables informed abstention and targeted review-particularly
valuable in edge deployments. Figures and tables validate the correlation
between I-scores and error likelihood, supporting more trustworthy,
human-in-the-loop AI decisions. This work shows that neutrosophic logic
enhances both accuracy and explainability, providing a practical foundation for
trust-aware AI in edge and fog-based IoT security systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DS3的框架，用于优化大型语言模型（LLM）的推理成本和效率，通过技能图随机遍历实现任务成功与计算成本的闭式表达。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLM在训练和推理阶段的资源消耗巨大，现有方法未能综合考虑模型规模、数据集大小和推理令牌的优化点，因此需要一种更高效的框架。

Method: 提出DS3框架，将推理表示为技能图的随机遍历，并通过闭式表达式分析不同推理策略（如CoT和ToT）的任务成功率和计算成本。

Result: 理论推导揭示了线性精度与对数计算的关系，以及任务难度和模型能力对推理策略的影响，同时统一了BoN和多数投票行为的分析框架。

Conclusion: DS3框架通过明确训练与推理的相互依赖关系，为理论理解和资源分配提供了支持。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demand considerable computational, energy, and
financial resources during both training and deployment. While scaling laws for
training have guided much of the field's recent progress, inference costs now
represent a significant and growing component of the overall resource burden,
particularly for reasoning-focused models. Existing characterizations of
compute-optimality that consider model size, dataset size, and inference tokens
in isolation or in fixed combinations risk overlooking more efficient operating
points. We introduce directed stochastic skill search (DS3), a general
framework that represents inference as stochastic traversal over a learned
skill graph. From a simplified yet expressive instantiation, we derive
closed-form expressions for task success and compute cost across a wide range
of inference strategies -- including chain-of-thought (CoT) and tree-of-thought
(ToT) -- enabling comparative analysis as a function of task difficulty and
model capability. To that end, we extend a prior first-principles tripartite
graph framework of LLM training to incorporate inference, and separately bridge
DS3 with empirical methods that characterize LLM scaling behavior. We
theoretically recover empirically observed patterns, including: linear accuracy
scaling with logarithmic compute; variation in preferred inference strategies
as a function of task difficulty and model capability; emergent behavior
elicited by reasoning even when performance plateaus under parameter scaling;
and both best-of-N (BoN) and majority voting behavior captured within a unified
analytical framework. By explicitly characterizing training-inference
interdependencies, our framework deepens theoretical understanding and supports
principled algorithmic design and resource allocation.

Motivation: 大型建筑中电梯交通管理的高效性对减少乘客等待时间和能耗至关重要，传统方法难以应对随机性和组合性问题。

Method: 采用马尔可夫决策过程建模，引入创新的动作空间编码、基础设施步骤和定制奖励信号，并探索基于Dueling Double Deep Q-learning的强化学习架构。

Result: 提出的RL-based EGCS能够适应波动的交通模式，在高度随机环境中学习，性能优于传统规则算法。

Conclusion: 强化学习方法在电梯群控系统中具有显著优势，能够有效提升调度效率和适应性。

Abstract: Efficient elevator traffic management in large buildings is critical for
minimizing passenger travel times and energy consumption. Because heuristic- or
pattern-detection-based controllers struggle with the stochastic and
combinatorial nature of dispatching, we model the six-elevator, fifteen-floor
system at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam as a Markov Decision Process and train
an end-to-end Reinforcement Learning (RL) Elevator Group Control System (EGCS).
Key innovations include a novel action space encoding to handle the
combinatorial complexity of elevator dispatching, the introduction of
infra-steps to model continuous passenger arrivals, and a tailored reward
signal to improve learning efficiency. In addition, we explore various ways to
adapt the discounting factor to the infra-step formulation. We investigate RL
architectures based on Dueling Double Deep Q-learning, showing that the
proposed RL-based EGCS adapts to fluctuating traffic patterns, learns from a
highly stochastic environment, and thereby outperforms a traditional rule-based
algorithm.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种称为CMIM的训练方法，通过最小化交叉熵损失和条件互信息（CMI）值，构建不可蒸馏的深度神经网络（DNN），以保护知识产权。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了保护DNN的知识产权，需要构建不可蒸馏的DNN，即通过知识蒸馏（KD）无法有效复制的模型。

Method: 提出CMIM方法，通过联合最小化交叉熵损失和温度缩放簇的条件互信息（CMI）值，训练DNN。

Result: 实验表明，CMIM模型对所有测试的KD方法均不可蒸馏，且其预测精度优于仅使用交叉熵损失训练的模型。

Conclusion: CMIM方法成功构建了不可蒸馏的DNN，同时提高了模型自身的预测性能。

Abstract: A deep neural network (DNN) is said to be undistillable if, when used as a
black-box input-output teacher, it cannot be distilled through knowledge
distillation (KD). In this case, the distilled student (referred to as the
knockoff student) does not outperform a student trained independently with
label smoothing (LS student) in terms of prediction accuracy. To protect
intellectual property of DNNs, it is desirable to build undistillable DNNs. To
this end, it is first observed that an undistillable DNN may have the trait
that each cluster of its output probability distributions in response to all
sample instances with the same label should be highly concentrated to the
extent that each cluster corresponding to each label should ideally collapse
into one probability distribution. Based on this observation and by measuring
the concentration of each cluster in terms of conditional mutual information
(CMI), a new training method called CMI minimized (CMIM) method is proposed,
which trains a DNN by jointly minimizing the conventional cross entropy (CE)
loss and the CMI values of all temperature scaled clusters across the entire
temperature spectrum. The resulting CMIM model is shown, by extensive
experiments, to be undistillable by all tested KD methods existing in the
literature. That is, the knockoff students distilled by these KD methods from
the CMIM model underperform the respective LS students. In addition, the CMIM
model is also shown to performs better than the model trained with the CE loss
alone in terms of their own prediction accuracy.

Motivation: 传统掩码时间序列建模方法忽略了时间序列的固有语义结构，可能导致学习到虚假的时序模式。

Result: 实验表明，ST-MTM在预测性能上优于现有的掩码建模、对比学习和监督预测方法。

Conclusion: ST-MTM通过分解和针对性掩码策略，有效捕捉了时间序列的复杂语义，显著提升了预测效果。

Abstract: Forecasting complex time series is an important yet challenging problem that
involves various industrial applications. Recently, masked time-series modeling
has been proposed to effectively model temporal dependencies for forecasting by
reconstructing masked segments from unmasked ones. However, since the semantic
information in time series is involved in intricate temporal variations
generated by multiple time series components, simply masking a raw time series
ignores the inherent semantic structure, which may cause MTM to learn spurious
temporal patterns present in the raw data. To capture distinct temporal
semantics, we show that masked modeling techniques should address entangled
patterns through a decomposition approach. Specifically, we propose ST-MTM, a
masked time-series modeling framework with seasonal-trend decomposition, which
includes a novel masking method for the seasonal-trend components that
incorporates different temporal variations from each component. ST-MTM uses a
period masking strategy for seasonal components to produce multiple masked
seasonal series based on inherent multi-periodicity and a sub-series masking
strategy for trend components to mask temporal regions that share similar
variations. The proposed masking method presents an effective pre-training task
for learning intricate temporal variations and dependencies. Additionally,
ST-MTM introduces a contrastive learning task to support masked modeling by
enhancing contextual consistency among multiple masked seasonal
representations. Experimental results show that our proposed ST-MTM achieves
consistently superior forecasting performance compared to existing masked
modeling, contrastive learning, and supervised forecasting methods.

resist catastrophic forgetting. We complement the dataset with (i) a
preliminary analysis of inter-task structural similarity and contextual
sensitivity, (ii) an interactive LangGraph-based evaluation framework augmented
with a FAISS-backed semantic memory module, and (iii) a suite of specialized
continual learning metrics -- including average accuracy, forgetting,
forward/backward transfer, tool-use efficiency, and a generalized Composite
Continual Learning Score and CL-F-beta score -- to capture the
stability-plasticity trade-off. We outline a rigorous experimental protocol
comparing memory-enabled and memory-disabled agents across diverse Python
repositories. All code and data are publicly available at

Result: 实验证明该方法在白盒攻击场景下优于多种竞争方法。

Conclusion: AdvI令牌在ViT中有效检测对抗攻击，简化系统架构并提升防御性能。

Abstract: The remarkable success of transformers across various fields such as natural
language processing and computer vision has paved the way for their
applications in automatic modulation classification, a critical component in
the communication systems of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. However, it has
been observed that transformer-based classification of radio signals is
susceptible to subtle yet sophisticated adversarial attacks. To address this
issue, we have developed a defensive strategy for transformer-based modulation
classification systems to counter such adversarial attacks. In this paper, we
propose a novel vision transformer (ViT) architecture by introducing a new
concept known as adversarial indicator (AdvI) token to detect adversarial
attacks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose an
AdvI token in ViT to defend against adversarial attacks. Integrating an
adversarial training method with a detection mechanism using AdvI token, we
combine a training time defense and running time defense in a unified neural
network model, which reduces architectural complexity of the system compared to
detecting adversarial perturbations using separate models. We investigate into
the operational principles of our method by examining the attention mechanism.
We show the proposed AdvI token acts as a crucial element within the ViT,
influencing attention weights and thereby highlighting regions or features in
the input data that are potentially suspicious or anomalous. Through
experimental results, we demonstrate that our approach surpasses several
competitive methods in handling white-box attack scenarios, including those
utilizing the fast gradient method, projected gradient descent attacks and
basic iterative method.

Result: GRFT在FGVC和VTAB数据集上仅需更新1.22%和0.30%的参数，性能优于GPS、Adapter Tuning和LoRA。

Conclusion: GRFT在高效性和性能上均优于现有方法，是一种有效的微调策略。

Abstract: Large pre-trained models have demonstrated extensive applications across
various fields. However, fine-tuning these models for specific downstream tasks
demands significant computational resources and storage. One fine-tuning
method, gradient-based parameter selection (GPS), focuses on fine-tuning only
the parameters with high gradients in each neuron, thereby reducing the number
of training parameters. Nevertheless, this approach increases computational
resource requirements and storage demands. In this paper, we propose an
efficient gradient-based and regularized fine-tuning method (GRFT) that updates
the rows or columns of the weight matrix. We theoretically demonstrate that the
rows or columns with the highest sum of squared gradients are optimal for
updating. This strategy effectively reduces storage overhead and improves the
efficiency of parameter selection. Additionally, we incorporate regularization
to enhance knowledge transfer from the pre-trained model. GRFT achieves
state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing methods such as GPS, Adapter
Tuning, and LoRA. Notably, GRFT requires updating only 1.22% and 0.30% of the
total parameters on FGVC and VTAB datasets, respectively, demonstrating its
high efficiency and effectiveness. The source code will be released soon.

Conclusion: 研究为后训练优化提供了理论支持和实用方法，扩展了LLM的应用潜力。

Abstract: Post-training processes are essential phases in grounding pre-trained
language models to real-world tasks, with learning from demonstrations or
preference signals playing a crucial role in this adaptation. We present a
unified theoretical framework bridging Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and
preference learning in Large Language Model (LLM) post-training. Through
rigorous mathematical derivation, we demonstrate that both SFT and preference
learning methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) operate within the
same optimal policy-reward subspace, with SFT representing a special case of
implicit reward learning. Our analysis reveals a critical limitation in
conventional SFT: the KL divergence term in distribution matching becomes
constant with respect to the policy during optimization, failing to constrain
model updates. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective learning rate
reduction approach that yields significant performance improvements (up to
\textbf{25\%} relative gain and \textbf{6\%} absolute win rate increase in
instruction following tasks. Additionally, we derive alternative SFT objectives
from various f-divergence functions that preserve the KL term during
optimization, further enhancing post-DPO model performance. Finally, we extend
the theoretical relationship between LLM logits and Q-functions from preference
learning to the SFT context, providing mathematical derivations and
experimental validation.

Abstract: In this study, we propose, evaluate and compare three quantum inspired data
encoding strategies, Instance Level Strategy (ILS), Global Discrete Strategy
(GDS) and Class Conditional Value Strategy (CCVS), for transforming classical
data into quantum data for use in pure classical machine learning models. The
primary objective is to reduce high encoding time while ensuring correct
encoding values and analyzing their impact on classification performance. The
Instance Level Strategy treats each row of dataset independently; mimics local
quantum states. Global Discrete Value Based encoding strategy maps all unique
feature values across the full dataset to quantum states uniformly. In
contrast, the Class conditional Value based encoding strategy encodes unique
values separately for each class, preserving class dependent information.
  We apply these encoding strategies to a classification task and assess their
impact on en-coding efficiency, correctness, model accuracy, and computational
cost. By analyzing the trade offs between encoding time, precision, and
predictive performance, this study provides insights into optimizing quantum
inspired data transformations for classical machine learning workflows.

Abstract: With the growing demand for novel materials, machine learning-driven inverse
design methods face significant challenges in reconciling the high-dimensional
materials composition space with limited experimental data. Existing approaches
suffer from two major limitations: (I) machine learning models often lack
reliability in high-dimensional spaces, leading to prediction biases during the
design process; (II) these models fail to effectively incorporate domain expert
knowledge, limiting their capacity to support knowledge-guided inverse design.
To address these challenges, we introduce AIMatDesign, a reinforcement learning
framework that addresses these limitations by augmenting experimental data
using difference-based algorithms to build a trusted experience pool,
accelerating model convergence. To enhance model reliability, an automated
refinement strategy guided by large language models (LLMs) dynamically corrects
prediction inconsistencies, reinforcing alignment between reward signals and
state value functions. Additionally, a knowledge-based reward function
leverages expert domain rules to improve stability and efficiency during
training. Our experiments demonstrate that AIMatDesign significantly surpasses
traditional machine learning and reinforcement learning methods in discovery
efficiency, convergence speed, and success rates. Among the numerous candidates
proposed by AIMatDesign, experimental synthesis of representative Zr-based
alloys yielded a top-performing BMG with 1.7GPa yield strength and 10.2\%
elongation, closely matching predictions. Moreover, the framework accurately
captured the trend of yield strength variation with composition, demonstrating

Conclusion: FNSDA提供了一种高效且通用的动态建模方法，适用于复杂物理系统的泛化预测。

Abstract: Learning the underlying dynamics from data with deep neural networks has
shown remarkable potential in modeling various complex physical dynamics.
However, current approaches are constrained in their ability to make reliable
predictions in a specific domain and struggle with generalizing to unseen
systems that are governed by the same general dynamics but differ in
environmental characteristics. In this work, we formulate a parameter-efficient
method, Fourier Neural Simulator for Dynamical Adaptation (FNSDA), that can
readily generalize to new dynamics via adaptation in the Fourier space.
Specifically, FNSDA identifies the shareable dynamics based on the known
environments using an automatic partition in Fourier modes and learns to adjust
the modes specific for each new environment by conditioning on low-dimensional
latent systematic parameters for efficient generalization. We evaluate our
approach on four representative families of dynamic systems, and the results
show that FNSDA can achieve superior or competitive generalization performance
compared to existing methods with a significantly reduced parameter cost. Our

Conclusion: ROSE为更实用和现实导向的LLMs安全性评估迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as black-box
components in real-world applications, evaluating their safety-especially under
adversarial prompting-has become critical. Arguably, effective safety
evaluations should be adaptive, evolving with LLM capabilities, and also cover
a broad spectrum of harmful topics and real-world scenarios to fully expose
potential vulnerabilities. Existing manual safety benchmarks, built on
handcrafted adversarial prompts, are limited by their static nature and the
intensive labor required to update them, making it difficult to keep pace with
rapidly advancing LLMs. In contrast, automated adversarial prompt generation
offers a promising path toward adaptive evaluation. However, current methods
often suffer from insufficient adversarial topic coverage (topic-level
diversity) and weak alignment with real-world contexts. These shortcomings stem
from the exploration-exploitation dilemma in black-box optimization and a lack
of real-world contextualization, resulting in adversarial prompts that are both
topically narrow and scenario-repetitive. To address these issues, we propose
Reality-Oriented Safety Evaluation (ROSE), a novel framework that uses
multi-objective reinforcement learning to fine-tune an adversarial LLM for
generating topically diverse and contextually rich adversarial prompts.
Experiments show that ROSE outperforms existing methods in uncovering safety
vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art LLMs, with notable improvements in
integrated evaluation metrics. We hope ROSE represents a step toward more
practical and reality-oriented safety evaluation of LLMs. WARNING: This paper
contains examples of potentially harmful text.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以同时捕捉轨迹的细粒度细节和高层摘要，限制了其对长期依赖和局部细微差异的关注。

Method: HiT-JEPA采用三层分层结构，逐步捕获点级细节、中间模式和高层轨迹抽象，整合局部动态和全局语义。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上的实验表明，HiT-JEPA的分层设计能生成更丰富的多尺度表示。

Conclusion: HiT-JEPA通过分层设计有效解决了轨迹表示的多尺度问题，提升了轨迹相似性计算的性能。

Abstract: The representation of urban trajectory data plays a critical role in
effectively analyzing spatial movement patterns. Despite considerable progress,
the challenge of designing trajectory representations that can capture diverse
and complementary information remains an open research problem. Existing
methods struggle in incorporating trajectory fine-grained details and
high-level summary in a single model, limiting their ability to attend to both
long-term dependencies while preserving local nuances. To address this, we
propose HiT-JEPA (Hierarchical Interactions of Trajectory Semantics via a Joint
Embedding Predictive Architecture), a unified framework for learning
multi-scale urban trajectory representations across semantic abstraction
levels. HiT-JEPA adopts a three-layer hierarchy that progressively captures
point-level fine-grained details, intermediate patterns, and high-level
trajectory abstractions, enabling the model to integrate both local dynamics
and global semantics in one coherent structure. Extensive experiments on
multiple real-world datasets for trajectory similarity computation show that
HiT-JEPA's hierarchical design yields richer, multi-scale representations. Code

*Wenbing Li,Zikai Song,Hang Zhou,Yunyao Zhang,Junqing Yu,Wei Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LoRA-Mixer是一种轻量级MoE框架，通过动态路由任务特定的LoRA专家提升参数效率和任务保真度，在多个基准数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在结合LoRA和MoE时存在参数效率低和任务保真度不足的问题，需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出LoRA-Mixer框架，动态替换注意力模块的输入/输出线性层为任务特定的LoRA专家，支持联合优化或直接部署预训练模块。

Result: 在多个数据集上显著优于基线模型和现有方法，如GSM8K提升7.61%，且仅使用48%的参数。

Conclusion: LoRA-Mixer在参数效率和性能上均表现出色，适用于多种基础模型。

Abstract: Recent efforts to combine low-rank adaptation (LoRA) with mixture-of-experts
(MoE) for adapting large language models (LLMs) to multiple tasks still exhibit
prevailing limitations: they either swap entire attention/feed-forward layers
for switch experts or bolt on parallel expert branches, diluting parameter
efficiency and task fidelity. We propose the LoRA-Mixer, a modular and
lightweight MoE framework that integrates LoRA experts. Our core innovation
lies in replacing the projection matrices of the attention module's
input/output linear layers with dynamically routed, task-specific LoRA experts.
This design ensures seamless compatibility with diverse foundation models,
including transformers and state space models (SSMs), by leveraging their
inherent linear projection structures. The framework supports two operational
paradigms: (1) joint optimization of LoRA experts and routing mechanisms via a
novel hard-soft routing strategy, or (2) direct deployment of pre-trained,
frozen LoRA modules sourced from external repositories. To enable robust router
training with limited data while ensuring stable routing decisions and
maximizing expert reuse, we introduce an adaptive Specialization Balance Loss
(SBL) that jointly optimizes expert balance and task-specific alignment.
Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets, including MedQA, CoLA,
SST-2, GSM8K, ARC-E, ARC-C, and HumanEval, demonstrate the effectiveness of
LoRA-Mixer. On datasets such as GSM8K, HumanEval, and MedQA, LoRA-Mixer
achieves significant improvements of 7.61%, 4.88%, and 3.08% over the base
models, respectively. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, LoRA-Mixer
achieves additional improvements of 1.09%, 1.45%, and 1.68%, respectively,
using only 48% of the parameters, demonstrating its efficiency and strong
performance.

Result: 在Atari 2600游戏中，相比静态持续时间基线，性能显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法为实时应用（如游戏和机器人）提供了可扩展的动态动作持续时间解决方案。

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has achieved remarkable success in complex
sequential decision-making tasks, such as playing Atari 2600 games and
mastering board games. A critical yet underexplored aspect of DRL is the
temporal scale of action execution. We propose a novel paradigm that integrates
contextual bandits with DRL to adaptively select action durations, enhancing
policy flexibility and computational efficiency. Our approach augments a Deep
Q-Network (DQN) with a contextual bandit module that learns to choose optimal
action repetition rates based on state contexts. Experiments on Atari 2600
games demonstrate significant performance improvements over static duration
baselines, highlighting the efficacy of adaptive temporal abstractions in DRL.
This paradigm offers a scalable solution for real-time applications like gaming
and robotics, where dynamic action durations are critical.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于神经元中心的新型模型融合算法，通过分组中间神经元并利用神经元属性评分，有效整合多个训练好的神经网络。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决模型融合中因内部表示差异（如排列不变性、随机初始化或不同分布的训练数据）导致的困难。

Method: 设计神经元中心融合算法，分组父模型的中间神经元，创建目标表示，并通过子网络近似。引入神经元属性评分。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上表现优于现有融合技术，尤其在零样本和非独立同分布场景中。

Conclusion: 提出的算法能有效整合不同模型，提升融合效果，代码已开源。

Abstract: Model fusion aims to combine the knowledge of multiple models by creating one
representative model that captures the strengths of all of its parents.
However, this process is non-trivial due to differences in internal
representations, which can stem from permutation invariance, random
initialization, or differently distributed training data. We present a novel,
neuron-centric family of model fusion algorithms designed to integrate multiple
trained neural networks into a single network effectively regardless of
training data distribution. Our algorithms group intermediate neurons of parent
models to create target representations that the fused model approximates with
its corresponding sub-network. Unlike prior approaches, our approach
incorporates neuron attribution scores into the fusion process. Furthermore,
our algorithms can generalize to arbitrary layer types. Experimental results on
various benchmark datasets demonstrate that our algorithms consistently
outperform previous fusion techniques, particularly in zero-shot and non-IID
fusion scenarios. The code is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于点状V信息（PVI）的数据缩减策略，通过筛选高难度实例提升模型训练效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在大规模数据集中选择最优实例而非全部数据以提高数据质量和训练效率的核心挑战。

Method: 使用PVI量化实例难度，静态过滤低难度实例，并采用渐进学习法按PVI升序训练分类器。

Result: 实验显示，移除10%-30%数据仅损失0.0001%-0.76%准确率，渐进学习法提升0.8%准确率。

Conclusion: PVI策略能有效提升模型性能和训练效率，且成功应用于中文NLP任务，实现跨语言数据缩减。

Abstract: Data reduction plays a vital role in data-centric AI by identifying the most
informative instance within large-scale datasets to enhance model training
efficiency. The core challenge lies in how to select the optimal
instances-rather than the entire datasets-to improve data quality and training
efficiency. In this paper, we propose an effective data reduction strategy
based on Pointwise V-information(PVI). First, we quantify instance difficulty
using PVI and filter out low-difficulty instances enabling a static approach.
Experiments demonstrate that removing 10%-30% of the data preserves the
classifier performance with only a 0.0001% to 0.76% loss in accuracy.Second, we
use a progressive learning approach to training the classifiers on instances
sorted by ascending PVI, accelerating convergence and achieving a 0.8% accuracy
gain over conventional training. Our results suggest that with the effective
data reduction strategy, training a classifier on the selected optimal subset
could enhance the model performance and boost training efficiency. Moreover, we
have transferred the PVI framework, which previously applied only to English
datasets, to diverse Chinese NLP tasks and base models, leading to valuable
insights for cross-lingual data reduction and faster training. The codes are

Result: 实验表明聚类预处理能减少模式数量并保持性能，某些流行度量效果不佳。

Conclusion: 研究为图分类中的质量度量选择提供了指导，并验证了预处理方法的有效性。

Abstract: Graph classification aims to categorize graphs based on their structural and
attribute features, with applications in diverse fields such as social network
analysis and bioinformatics. Among the methods proposed to solve this task,
those relying on patterns (i.e. subgraphs) provide good explainability, as the
patterns used for classification can be directly interpreted. To identify
meaningful patterns, a standard approach is to use a quality measure, i.e. a
function that evaluates the discriminative power of each pattern. However, the
literature provides tens of such measures, making it difficult to select the
most appropriate for a given application. Only a handful of surveys try to
provide some insight by comparing these measures, and none of them specifically
focuses on graphs. This typically results in the systematic use of the most
widespread measures, without thorough evaluation. To address this issue, we
present a comparative analysis of 38 quality measures from the literature. We
characterize them theoretically, based on four mathematical properties. We
leverage publicly available datasets to constitute a benchmark, and propose a
method to elaborate a gold standard ranking of the patterns. We exploit these
resources to perform an empirical comparison of the measures, both in terms of
pattern ranking and classification performance. Moreover, we propose a
clustering-based preprocessing step, which groups patterns appearing in the
same graphs to enhance classification performance. Our experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of this step, reducing the number of patterns to
be processed while achieving comparable performance. Additionally, we show that
some popular measures widely used in the literature are not associated with the
best results.

Result: 在多个评估场景中表现优于其他方法，提升了活动识别和位置检测的准确性，减少了过拟合。

Conclusion: Smooth-Distill为多任务学习提供了一种高效解决方案，降低了计算成本，适用于资源受限平台。

Abstract: This paper introduces Smooth-Distill, a novel self-distillation framework
designed to simultaneously perform human activity recognition (HAR) and sensor
placement detection using wearable sensor data. The proposed approach utilizes
a unified CNN-based architecture, MTL-net, which processes accelerometer data
and branches into two outputs for each respective task. Unlike conventional
distillation methods that require separate teacher and student models, the
proposed framework utilizes a smoothed, historical version of the model itself
as the teacher, significantly reducing training computational overhead while
maintaining performance benefits. To support this research, we developed a
comprehensive accelerometer-based dataset capturing 12 distinct sleep postures
across three different wearing positions, complementing two existing public
datasets (MHealth and WISDM). Experimental results show that Smooth-Distill
consistently outperforms alternative approaches across different evaluation
scenarios, achieving notable improvements in both human activity recognition
and device placement detection tasks. This method demonstrates enhanced
stability in convergence patterns during training and exhibits reduced
overfitting compared to traditional multitask learning baselines. This
framework contributes to the practical implementation of knowledge distillation
in human activity recognition systems, offering an effective solution for
multitask learning with accelerometer data that balances accuracy and training
efficiency. More broadly, it reduces the computational cost of model training,
which is critical for scenarios requiring frequent model updates or training on
resource-constrained platforms. The code and model are available at

Method: 提出求解器-验证器间隙的理论框架，并基于此预测自改进的最终能力。

Result: 理论模型在多种LLM和数据集上得到验证，且发现有限外部数据不影响最终性能。

Conclusion: 自改进性能提升源于求解器与验证器能力的差距，外部数据在有限条件下可灵活使用。

Abstract: Self-improvement is among the most prominent techniques within the realm of
large language models (LLM), aiming to enhance the LLM performance without
relying on external data. Despite its significance, generally how LLM
performances evolve during the self-improvement process remains underexplored.
In this paper, we theoretically model the training dynamics of self-improvement
via the concept of solver-verifier gap. This is inspired by the conjecture that
the performance enhancement of self-improvement stems from the gap between
LLM's solver capability and verifier capability. Based on the theoretical
framework, we further introduce how to predict the ultimate power of
self-improvement using only information from the first few training epochs. We
empirically validate the effectiveness of the theoretical model on various LLMs
and datasets. Beyond self-improvement, we extend our analysis to investigate
how external data influences these dynamics within the framework. Notably, we
find that under limited external data regimes, such external data can be
utilized at any stage without significantly affecting final performances, which
accords with the empirical observations.

Abstract: With the rise of large language models, the paradigm of training foundation
models with massive parameter counts on vast datasets has been adopted in
multiple domains to achieve remarkable success. Time series foundation models
represent a significant extension of this paradigm, demonstrating exceptional
expressive power, generalization, and cross-domain transferability. However,
this gives rise to a fundamental paradox: time series data reflect distinct
dynamical systems, making cross-domain transfer intuitively implausible, yet
this is contradicted by the models' empirical success. To resolve this paradox,
this paper investigates, from both theoretical and experimental perspectives,
the representation learning mechanisms and generalization capabilities of
patch-based time series foundation models. We argue that such models are not
merely applying a new architecture but are fundamentally generalizing the
representation paradigm of language models by extending deterministic
vector-based representations to latent probabilistic distributional forms. Our
theoretical analysis supports this framework by demonstrating that continuous
time-series patches can be faithfully quantized into a discrete vocabulary
whose key statistical properties are highly consistent with those of natural
language. This generalization allows time series models to inherit the robust
representation and transfer abilities of large language models, thereby
explaining their superior performance in temporal tasks. Ultimately, our work
provides a rigorous theoretical cornerstone for understanding, evaluating, and
improving the safety and reliability of large-scale time series foundation
models.

Motivation: 解决传统混合语言模型因频繁调用LLM导致的通信开销问题，特别是在带宽受限环境中。

Method: 集成不确定性感知推理与联邦学习，动态学习阈值；引入P2P重用和分层模型聚合。

Result: 在大规模新闻分类任务中，LLM传输减少95%以上，精度损失可忽略。

Conclusion: FedHLM适用于高效、可扩展的边缘AI应用。

Abstract: Hybrid Language Models (HLMs) combine the low-latency efficiency of Small
Language Models (SLMs) on edge devices with the high accuracy of Large Language
Models (LLMs) on centralized servers. Unlike traditional end-to-end LLM
inference, HLMs reduce latency and communication by invoking LLMs only when
local SLM predictions are uncertain, i.e., when token-level confidence is low
or entropy is high. However, ambiguous or low-confidence predictions still
require frequent offloading to the LLM, leading to significant communication
overhead in bandwidth-constrained settings. To address this, we propose FedHLM,
a communication-efficient HLM framework that integrates uncertainty-aware
inference with Federated Learning (FL). FedHLM's key innovation lies in
collaboratively learning token-level uncertainty thresholds that govern when
LLM assistance is needed. Rather than using static or manually tuned
thresholds, FedHLM employs FL to optimize these thresholds in a
privacy-preserving, distributed manner. Additionally, it leverages
embedding-based token representations for Peer-to-Peer (P2P) resolution,
enabling clients to reuse tokens inferred by semantically similar peers without
engaging the LLM. We further introduce hierarchical model aggregation: edge
servers refine local routing policies through client updates, while
cross-cluster coordination aligns global decision boundaries. This layered
design captures recurring uncertainty patterns, reducing redundant LLM queries.
Experiments on large-scale news classification tasks show that FedHLM reduces
LLM transmissions by over 95 percent with negligible accuracy loss, making it
well-suited for scalable and efficient edge-AI applications.

Motivation: 当前战略级模拟在捕捉‘韧性-节点压制-谈判窗口’链中的中间变量时存在结构性瓶颈，缺乏因果建模。

Method: 提出IA-STGNN框架，结合图注意力机制、反事实模拟单元和空间干预节点重建，实现动态模拟。训练数据来自多物理模拟平台（GEANT4 + COMSOL）。

Result: IA-STGNN显著优于基线模型，MAE降低12.8%，Top-5准确率提升18.4%，同时提高了因果路径一致性和干预稳定性。

Conclusion: IA-STGNN为高层政策建模提供了结构化且透明的AI决策支持机制，适用于核威慑模拟、外交窗口评估等应用。

Abstract: This study addresses the lack of structured causal modeling between tactical
strike behavior and strategic delay in current strategic-level simulations,
particularly the structural bottlenecks in capturing intermediate variables
within the "resilience - nodal suppression - negotiation window" chain. We
propose the Intervention-Aware Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network (IA-STGNN),
a novel framework that closes the causal loop from tactical input to strategic
delay output. The model integrates graph attention mechanisms, counterfactual
simulation units, and spatial intervention node reconstruction to enable
dynamic simulations of strike configurations and synchronization strategies.
Training data are generated from a multi-physics simulation platform (GEANT4 +
COMSOL) under NIST SP 800-160 standards, ensuring structural traceability and
policy-level validation. Experimental results demonstrate that IA-STGNN
significantly outperforms baseline models (ST-GNN, GCN-LSTM, XGBoost),
achieving a 12.8 percent reduction in MAE and 18.4 percent increase in Top-5
percent accuracy, while improving causal path consistency and intervention
stability. IA-STGNN enables interpretable prediction of strategic delay and
supports applications such as nuclear deterrence simulation, diplomatic window
assessment, and multi-strategy optimization, providing a structured and
transparent AI decision-support mechanism for high-level policy modeling.

Conclusion: 该方法通过时空对齐和因果保真，弥合技术输出与用户理解之间的差距，提供透明、实时的决策支持。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel framework for enhancing model
interpretability by integrating heatmaps produced separately by ResNet and a
restructured 2D Transformer with globally weighted input saliency. We address
the critical problem of spatial-temporal misalignment in existing
interpretability methods, where convolutional networks fail to capture global
context and Transformers lack localized precision - a limitation that impedes
actionable insights in safety-critical domains like healthcare and industrial
monitoring. Our method merges gradient-weighted activation maps (ResNet) and
Transformer attention rollout into a unified visualization, achieving full
spatial-temporal alignment while preserving real-time performance. Empirical
evaluations on clinical (ECG arrhythmia detection) and industrial (energy
consumption prediction) datasets demonstrate significant improvements: the
hybrid framework achieves 94.1% accuracy (F1 0.93) on the PhysioNet dataset and
reduces regression error to RMSE = 0.28 kWh (R2 = 0.95) on the UCI Energy
Appliance dataset-outperforming standalone ResNet, Transformer, and
InceptionTime baselines by 3.8-12.4%. An NLP module translates fused heatmaps
into domain-specific narratives (e.g., "Elevated ST-segment between 2-4 seconds
suggests myocardial ischemia"), validated via BLEU-4 (0.586) and ROUGE-L
(0.650) scores. By formalizing interpretability as causal fidelity and
spatial-temporal alignment, our approach bridges the gap between technical
outputs and stakeholder understanding, offering a scalable solution for
transparent, time-aware decision-making.

Result: 实验表明，GFEN在预测精度上优于现有方法约6.3%，收敛速度是近期混合模型的两倍。

Conclusion: GFEN在交通预测中表现出卓越性能，有望显著提升智能交通系统的效率。

Abstract: Accurate traffic prediction is essential for Intelligent Transportation
Systems (ITS), yet current methods struggle with the inherent complexity and
non-linearity of traffic dynamics, making it difficult to integrate spatial and
temporal characteristics. Furthermore, existing approaches use static
techniques to address non-stationary and anomalous historical data, which
limits adaptability and undermines data smoothing. To overcome these
challenges, we propose the Graph Fusion Enhanced Network (GFEN), an innovative
framework for network-level traffic speed prediction. GFEN introduces a novel
topological spatiotemporal graph fusion technique that meticulously extracts
and merges spatial and temporal correlations from both data distribution and
network topology using trainable methods, enabling the modeling of multi-scale
spatiotemporal features. Additionally, GFEN employs a hybrid methodology
combining a k-th order difference-based mathematical framework with an
attention-based deep learning structure to adaptively smooth historical
observations and dynamically mitigate data anomalies and non-stationarity.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that GFEN surpasses state-of-the-art methods
by approximately 6.3% in prediction accuracy and exhibits convergence rates
nearly twice as fast as recent hybrid models, confirming its superior
performance and potential to significantly enhance traffic prediction system
efficiency.

Conclusion: pUniFind为蛋白质组学分析提供了一个统一、可扩展的深度学习框架，显著提升了敏感性和修饰覆盖范围。

Abstract: Deep learning has advanced mass spectrometry data interpretation, yet most
models remain feature extractors rather than unified scoring frameworks. We
present pUniFind, the first large-scale multimodal pre-trained model in
proteomics that integrates end-to-end peptide-spectrum scoring with open,
zero-shot de novo sequencing. Trained on over 100 million open search-derived
spectra, pUniFind aligns spectral and peptide modalities via cross modality
prediction and outperforms traditional engines across diverse datasets,
particularly achieving a 42.6 percent increase in the number of identified
peptides in immunopeptidomics. Supporting over 1,300 modifications, pUniFind
identifies 60 percent more PSMs than existing de novo methods despite a
300-fold larger search space. A deep learning based quality control module
further recovers 38.5 percent additional peptides including 1,891 mapped to the
genome but absent from reference proteomes while preserving full fragment ion
coverage. These results establish a unified, scalable deep learning framework
for proteomic analysis, offering improved sensitivity, modification coverage,
and interpretability.

Abstract: The promise of autonomous scientific discovery (ASD) hinges not only on
answering questions, but also on knowing which questions to ask. Most recent
works in ASD explore the use of large language models (LLMs) in goal-driven
settings, relying on human-specified research questions to guide hypothesis
generation. However, scientific discovery may be accelerated further by
allowing the AI system to drive exploration by its own criteria. The few
existing approaches in open-ended ASD select hypotheses based on diversity
heuristics or subjective proxies for human interestingness, but the former
struggles to meaningfully navigate the typically vast hypothesis space, and the
latter suffers from imprecise definitions. This paper presents AutoDS -- a
method for open-ended ASD that instead drives scientific exploration using
Bayesian surprise. Here, we quantify the epistemic shift from the LLM's prior
beliefs about a hypothesis to its posterior beliefs after gathering
experimental results. To efficiently explore the space of nested hypotheses,
our method employs a Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) strategy with progressive
widening using surprisal as the reward function. We evaluate AutoDS in the
setting of data-driven discovery across 21 real-world datasets spanning domains
such as biology, economics, finance, and behavioral science. Our results
demonstrate that under a fixed budget, AutoDS substantially outperforms
competitors by producing 5--29\% more discoveries deemed surprising by the LLM.
Our human evaluation further finds that two-thirds of AutoDS discoveries are
surprising to the domain experts, suggesting this is an important step forward
towards building open-ended ASD systems.

Motivation: 自动化放射学报告生成（RRG）面临从复杂影像数据中提取信息及客观评估模型生成报告与专家报告差异的挑战，需改进现有方法。

Method: 提出μ²LLM模型，结合μ²Tokenizer整合多尺度视觉和文本特征，并通过DPO优化报告生成质量。

Conclusion: μ²LLM通过多模态特征整合和优化策略，显著提升了RRG任务的性能，为临床诊断提供了高效工具。

Abstract: Automated radiology report generation (RRG) aims to produce detailed textual
reports from clinical imaging, such as computed tomography (CT) scans, to
improve the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosis and provision of management
advice. RRG is complicated by two key challenges: (1) inherent complexity in
extracting relevant information from imaging data under resource constraints,
and (2) difficulty in objectively evaluating discrepancies between
model-generated and expert-written reports. To address these challenges, we
propose $\mu^2$LLM, a $\underline{\textbf{mu}}$ltiscale
$\underline{\textbf{mu}}$ltimodal large language models for RRG tasks. The
novel ${\mu}^2$Tokenizer, as an intermediate layer, integrates multi-modal
features from the multiscale visual tokenizer and the text tokenizer, then
enhances report generation quality through direct preference optimization
(DPO), guided by GREEN-RedLlama. Experimental results on four large CT
image-report medical datasetdemonstrate that our method outperforms existing
approaches, highlighting the potential of our fine-tuned $\mu^2$LLMs on limited
data for RRG tasks.

Abstract: Allocation of personnel and material resources is highly sensible in the case
of firefighter interventions. This allocation relies on simulations to
experiment with various scenarios. The main objective of this allocation is the
global optimization of the firefighters response. Data generation is then
mandatory to study various scenarios In this study, we propose to compare
different data generation methods. Methods such as Random Sampling, Tabular
Variational Autoencoders, standard Generative Adversarial Networks, Conditional
Tabular Generative Adversarial Networks and Diffusion Probabilistic Models are
examined to ascertain their efficacy in capturing the intricacies of
firefighter interventions. Traditional evaluation metrics often fall short in
capturing the nuanced requirements of synthetic datasets for real-world
scenarios. To address this gap, an evaluation of synthetic data quality is
conducted using a combination of domain-specific metrics tailored to the
firefighting domain and standard measures such as the Wasserstein distance.
Domain-specific metrics include response time distribution, spatial-temporal
distribution of interventions, and accidents representation. These metrics are
designed to assess data variability, the preservation of fine and complex
correlations and anomalies such as event with a very low occurrence, the
conformity with the initial statistical distribution and the operational
relevance of the synthetic data. The distribution has the particularity of
being highly unbalanced, none of the variables following a Gaussian
distribution, adding complexity to the data generation process.

Abstract: Autoregressive models have driven remarkable progress in language modeling.
Their foundational reliance on discrete tokens, unidirectional context, and
single-pass decoding, while central to their success, also inspires the
exploration of a design space that could offer new axes of modeling
flexibility. In this work, we explore an alternative paradigm, shifting
language modeling from a discrete token space to a continuous latent space. We
propose a novel framework TarFlowLM, that employs transformer-based
autoregressive normalizing flows to model these continuous representations.
This approach unlocks substantial flexibility, enabling the construction of
models that can capture global bi-directional context through stacked,
alternating-direction autoregressive transformations, support block-wise
generation with flexible token patch sizes, and facilitate a hierarchical
multi-pass generation process. We further propose new mixture-based coupling
transformations designed to capture complex dependencies within the latent
space shaped by discrete data, and demonstrate theoretical connections to
conventional discrete autoregressive models. Extensive experiments on language
modeling benchmarks demonstrate strong likelihood performance and highlight the
flexible modeling capabilities inherent in our framework.

Result: 实验表明，HAX在合成和真实长上下文任务中均优于SSMs及其变体。

Conclusion: 通过理论分析和实际应用结合，论文为长上下文建模提供了一种高效且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Efficient long-context modeling remains a critical challenge for natural
language processing (NLP), as the time complexity of the predominant
Transformer architecture scales quadratically with the sequence length. While
state-space models (SSMs) offer alternative sub-quadratic solutions, they
struggle to capture long-range dependencies effectively. In this work, we focus
on analyzing and improving the long-context modeling capabilities of SSMs. We
show that the widely used synthetic task, associative recall, which requires a
model to recall a value associated with a single key without context,
insufficiently represents the complexities of real-world long-context modeling.
To address this limitation, we extend the associative recall to a novel
synthetic task, \emph{joint recall}, which requires a model to recall the value
associated with a key given in a specified context. Theoretically, we prove
that SSMs do not have the expressiveness to solve multi-query joint recall in
sub-quadratic time complexity. To resolve this issue, we propose a solution
based on integrating SSMs with Context-Dependent Sparse Attention (CDSA), which
has the expressiveness to solve multi-query joint recall with sub-quadratic
computation. To bridge the gap between theoretical analysis and real-world
applications, we propose locality-sensitive Hashing Attention with sparse Key
Selection (HAX), which instantiates the theoretical solution and is further
tailored to natural language domains. Extensive experiments on both synthetic
and real-world long-context benchmarks show that HAX consistently outperforms
SSM baselines and SSMs integrated with context-independent sparse attention
(CISA).

Conclusion: 该方法提升了数据驱动故障检测的可信度和可解释性，适用于工业质量控制。

Abstract: Ensuring consistent product quality in modern manufacturing is crucial,
particularly in safety-critical applications. Conventional quality control
approaches, reliant on manually defined thresholds and features, lack
adaptability to the complexity and variability inherent in production data and
necessitate extensive domain expertise. Conversely, data-driven methods, such
as machine learning, demonstrate high detection performance but typically
function as black-box models, thereby limiting their acceptance in industrial
environments where interpretability is paramount. This paper introduces a
methodology for industrial fault detection, which is both data-driven and
transparent. The approach integrates a supervised machine learning model for
multi-class fault classification, Shapley Additive Explanations for post-hoc
interpretability, and a do-main-specific visualisation technique that maps
model explanations to operator-interpretable features. Furthermore, the study
proposes an evaluation methodology that assesses model explanations through
quantitative perturbation analysis and evaluates visualisations by qualitative
expert assessment. The approach was applied to the crimping process, a
safety-critical joining technique, using a dataset of univariate, discrete time
series. The system achieves a fault detection accuracy of 95.9 %, and both
quantitative selectivity analysis and qualitative expert evaluations confirmed
the relevance and inter-pretability of the generated explanations. This
human-centric approach is designed to enhance trust and interpretability in
data-driven fault detection, thereby contributing to applied system design in
industrial quality control.

Abstract: Recent research shows how diffusion models can unconditionally generate
tile-based game levels, but use of diffusion models for text-to-level
generation is underexplored. There are practical considerations for creating a
usable model: caption/level pairs are needed, as is a text embedding model, and
a way of generating entire playable levels, rather than individual scenes. We
present strategies to automatically assign descriptive captions to an existing
level dataset, and train diffusion models using both pretrained text encoders
and simple transformer models trained from scratch. Captions are automatically
assigned to generated levels so that the degree of overlap between input and
output captions can be compared. We also assess the diversity and playability
of the resulting levels. Results are compared with an unconditional diffusion
model and a generative adversarial network, as well as the text-to-level
approaches Five-Dollar Model and MarioGPT. Notably, the best diffusion model
uses a simple transformer model for text embedding, and takes less time to
train than diffusion models employing more complex text encoders, indicating
that reliance on larger language models is not necessary. We also present a GUI
allowing designers to construct long levels from model-generated scenes.

Abstract: Wearable devices record physiological and behavioral signals that can improve
health predictions. While foundation models are increasingly used for such
predictions, they have been primarily applied to low-level sensor data, despite
behavioral data often being more informative due to their alignment with
physiologically relevant timescales and quantities. We develop foundation
models of such behavioral signals using over 2.5B hours of wearable data from
162K individuals, systematically optimizing architectures and tokenization
strategies for this unique dataset. Evaluated on 57 health-related tasks, our
model shows strong performance across diverse real-world applications including
individual-level classification and time-varying health state prediction. The
model excels in behavior-driven tasks like sleep prediction, and improves
further when combined with representations of raw sensor data. These results
underscore the importance of tailoring foundation model design to wearables and
demonstrate the potential to enable new health applications.

Conclusion: 结论是局部更新算法在异构环境中具有理论优势，论文为分析Local SGD提供了完整指南。

Abstract: This thesis contributes to the theoretical understanding of local update
algorithms, especially Local SGD, in distributed and federated optimization
under realistic models of data heterogeneity. A central focus is on the bounded
second-order heterogeneity assumption, which is shown to be both necessary and
sufficient for local updates to outperform centralized or mini-batch methods in
convex and non-convex settings. The thesis establishes tight upper and lower
bounds in several regimes for various local update algorithms and characterizes
the min-max complexity of multiple problem classes. At its core is a
fine-grained consensus-error-based analysis framework that yields sharper
finite-time convergence bounds under third-order smoothness and relaxed
heterogeneity assumptions. The thesis also extends to online federated
learning, providing fundamental regret bounds under both first-order and bandit
feedback. Together, these results clarify when and why local updates offer
provable advantages, and the thesis serves as a self-contained guide for
analyzing Local SGD in heterogeneous environments.

Abstract: In recent years, \emph{Reinforcement Learning} (RL) has made remarkable
progress, achieving superhuman performance in a wide range of simulated
environments. As research moves toward deploying RL in real-world applications,
the field faces a new set of challenges inherent to real-world settings, such
as large state-action spaces, non-stationarity, and partial observability.
Despite their importance, these challenges are often underexplored in current
benchmarks, which tend to focus on idealized, fully observable, and stationary
environments, often neglecting to incorporate real-world complexities
explicitly. In this paper, we introduce \texttt{Gym4ReaL}, a comprehensive
suite of realistic environments designed to support the development and
evaluation of RL algorithms that can operate in real-world scenarios. The suite
includes a diverse set of tasks that expose algorithms to a variety of
practical challenges. Our experimental results show that, in these settings,
standard RL algorithms confirm their competitiveness against rule-based
benchmarks, motivating the development of new methods to fully exploit the
potential of RL to tackle the complexities of real-world tasks.

Result: DDQL在57个Atari 2600游戏中表现优于Double DQN，且无需额外超参数。

Conclusion: DDQL有效减少了过估计，性能优于Double DQN，并探讨了其网络架构等细节。

Abstract: Overestimation is pervasive in reinforcement learning (RL), including in
Q-learning, which forms the algorithmic basis for many value-based deep RL
algorithms. Double Q-learning is an algorithm introduced to address
Q-learning's overestimation by training two Q-functions and using both to
de-correlate action-selection and action-evaluation in bootstrap targets.
Shortly after Q-learning was adapted to deep RL in the form of deep Q-networks
(DQN), Double Q-learning was adapted to deep RL in the form of Double DQN.
However, Double DQN only loosely adapts Double Q-learning, forgoing the
training of two different Q-functions that bootstrap off one another. In this
paper, we study algorithms that adapt this core idea of Double Q-learning for
value-based deep RL. We term such algorithms Deep Double Q-learning (DDQL). Our
aim is to understand whether DDQL exhibits less overestimation than Double DQN
and whether performant instantiations of DDQL exist. We answer both questions
affirmatively, demonstrating that DDQL reduces overestimation and outperforms
Double DQN in aggregate across 57 Atari 2600 games, without requiring
additional hyperparameters. We also study several aspects of DDQL, including
its network architecture, replay ratio, and minibatch sampling strategy.

Abstract: We study reinforcement learning (RL) for the same class of continuous-time
stochastic linear--quadratic (LQ) control problems as in
\cite{huang2024sublinear}, where volatilities depend on both states and
controls while states are scalar-valued and running control rewards are absent.
We propose a model-free, data-driven exploration mechanism that adaptively
adjusts entropy regularization by the critic and policy variance by the actor.
Unlike the constant or deterministic exploration schedules employed in
\cite{huang2024sublinear}, which require extensive tuning for implementations
and ignore learning progresses during iterations, our adaptive exploratory
approach boosts learning efficiency with minimal tuning. Despite its
flexibility, our method achieves a sublinear regret bound that matches the
best-known model-free results for this class of LQ problems, which were
previously derived only with fixed exploration schedules. Numerical experiments
demonstrate that adaptive explorations accelerate convergence and improve
regret performance compared to the non-adaptive model-free and model-based
counterparts.

Abstract: Through recognizing causal subgraphs, causal graph learning (CGL) has risen
to be a promising approach for improving the generalizability of graph neural
networks under out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. However, the empirical
successes of CGL techniques are mostly exemplified in classification settings,
while regression tasks, a more challenging setting in graph learning, are
overlooked. We thus devote this work to tackling causal graph regression (CGR);
to this end we reshape the processing of confounding effects in existing CGL
studies, which mainly deal with classification. Specifically, we reflect on the
predictive power of confounders in graph-level regression, and generalize
classification-specific causal intervention techniques to regression through a
lens of contrastive learning. Extensive experiments on graph OOD benchmarks
validate the efficacy of our proposals for CGR. The model implementation and
the code are provided on https://github.com/causal-graph/CGR.

Abstract: We address the problem of fine-tuning diffusion models for reward-guided
generation in biomolecular design. While diffusion models have proven highly
effective in modeling complex, high-dimensional data distributions, real-world
applications often demand more than high-fidelity generation, requiring
optimization with respect to potentially non-differentiable reward functions
such as physics-based simulation or rewards based on scientific knowledge.
Although RL methods have been explored to fine-tune diffusion models for such
objectives, they often suffer from instability, low sample efficiency, and mode
collapse due to their on-policy nature. In this work, we propose an iterative
distillation-based fine-tuning framework that enables diffusion models to
optimize for arbitrary reward functions. Our method casts the problem as policy
distillation: it collects off-policy data during the roll-in phase, simulates
reward-based soft-optimal policies during roll-out, and updates the model by
minimizing the KL divergence between the simulated soft-optimal policy and the
current model policy. Our off-policy formulation, combined with KL divergence
minimization, enhances training stability and sample efficiency compared to

superior reward optimization of our approach across diverse tasks in protein,
small molecule, and regulatory DNA design.

Motivation: 在多问题领域中，准确识别每个子任务的最佳算法是一个关键问题，现有方法在性能上存在不足。

Method: 将问题建模为多臂老虎机的最佳臂识别问题，提出基于Wilson得分区间的乐观选择方法（Optimistic-WS）。

Result: 在GVGAI和Ludii游戏框架中，Optimistic-WS显著降低了平均简单遗憾，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Optimistic-WS为多任务领域提供了一种高效、准确的算法评估方法，尤其适用于高计算成本的场景。

Abstract: We present an efficient and generalised procedure to accurately identify the
best performing algorithm for each sub-task in a multi-problem domain. Our
approach treats this as a set of best arm identification problems for
multi-armed bandits, where each bandit corresponds to a specific task and each
arm corresponds to a specific algorithm or agent. We propose an optimistic
selection process based on the Wilson score interval (Optimistic-WS) that ranks
each arm across all bandits in terms of their potential regret reduction. We
evaluate the performance of Optimistic-WS on two of the most popular general
game domains, the General Video Game AI (GVGAI) framework and the Ludii general
game playing system, with the goal of identifying the highest performing agent
for each game within a limited number of trials. Compared to previous best arm
identification algorithms for multi-armed bandits, our results demonstrate a
substantial performance improvement in terms of average simple regret. This
novel approach can be used to significantly improve the quality and accuracy of
agent evaluation procedures for general game frameworks, as well as other
multi-task domains with high algorithm runtimes.

Motivation: 标准随机森林依赖大量树和所有特征，导致推理成本高和模型冗余。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，改进模型比标准随机森林精度更高。

Conclusion: 该方法有效减少了模型冗余并提升了分类性能。

Abstract: Random Forest (RF) is a widely used ensemble learning technique known for its
robust classification performance across diverse domains. However, it often
relies on hundreds of trees and all input features, leading to high inference
cost and model redundancy. In this work, our goal is to grow trees dynamically
only on informative features and then enforce maximal diversity by clustering
and retaining uncorrelated trees. Therefore, we propose a Refined Random Forest
Classifier that iteratively refines itself by first removing the least
informative features and then analytically determines how many new trees should
be grown, followed by correlation-based clustering to remove redundant trees.
The classification accuracy of our model was compared against the standard RF
on the same number of trees. Experiments on 8 multiple benchmark datasets,
including binary and multiclass datasets, demonstrate that the proposed model
achieves improved accuracy compared to standard RF.

Result: 未观察到原始研究中情绪类别与脑模式的固定映射，而是发现个体间存在显著变异。

Conclusion: 研究假设对科学结论有重要影响，需通过多种分析方法验证假设的可靠性。

Abstract: In the science of emotion, it is widely assumed that folk emotion categories
form a biological and psychological typology, and studies are routinely
designed and analyzed to identify emotion-specific patterns. This approach
shapes the observations that studies report, ultimately reinforcing the
assumption that guided the investigation. Here, we reanalyzed data from one
such typologically-guided study that reported mappings between individual brain
patterns and group-averaged ratings of 34 emotion categories. Our reanalysis
was guided by an alternative view of emotion categories as populations of
variable, situated instances, and which predicts a priori that there will be
significant variation in brain patterns within a category across instances.
Correspondingly, our analysis made minimal assumptions about the structure of
the variance present in the data. As predicted, we did not observe the original
mappings and instead observed significant variation across individuals. These
findings demonstrate how starting assumptions can ultimately impact scientific
conclusions and suggest that a hypothesis must be supported using multiple
analytic methods before it is taken seriously.

Result: 实验验证了PNAct框架的有效性，证明了Safe RL存在后门攻击的可行性。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了Safe RL的后门攻击风险，为未来研究提供了安全性的新视角。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is widely used in tasks where agents interact
with an environment to maximize rewards. Building on this foundation, Safe
Reinforcement Learning (Safe RL) incorporates a cost metric alongside the
reward metric, ensuring that agents adhere to safety constraints during
decision-making. In this paper, we identify that Safe RL is vulnerable to
backdoor attacks, which can manipulate agents into performing unsafe actions.
First, we introduce the relevant concepts and evaluation metrics for backdoor
attacks in Safe RL. It is the first attack framework in the Safe RL field that
involves both Positive and Negative Action sample (PNAct) is to implant
backdoors, where positive action samples provide reference actions and negative
action samples indicate actions to be avoided. We theoretically point out the
properties of PNAct and design an attack algorithm. Finally, we conduct
experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed backdoor attack
framework, evaluating it with the established metrics. This paper highlights
the potential risks associated with Safe RL and underscores the feasibility of
such attacks. Our code and supplementary material are available at

Result: 实验表明，这些策略提升了性能，并有助于理解GANs的正则化机制。

Conclusion: 通过概率视角和边际似然优化，为GANs的正则化和优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are popular and successful generative
models. Despite their success, optimization is notoriously challenging and they
require regularization against overfitting. In this work, we explain the
success and limitations of GANs by interpreting them as probabilistic
generative models. This interpretation enables us to view GANs as Bayesian
neural networks with partial stochasticity, allowing us to establish conditions
of universal approximation. We can then cast the adversarial-style optimization
of several variants of GANs as the optimization of a proxy for the marginal
likelihood. Taking advantage of the connection between marginal likelihood
optimization and Occam's razor, we can define regularization and optimization
strategies to smooth the loss landscape and search for solutions with minimum
description length, which are associated with flat minima and good
generalization. The results on a wide range of experiments indicate that these
strategies lead to performance improvements and pave the way to a deeper
understanding of regularization strategies for GANs.

Conclusion: QRL-NAS有效优化PQC结构，提升量子强化学习的实用性和效率。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) enables agents to learn optimal policies through
environmental interaction. However, RL suffers from reduced learning efficiency
due to the curse of dimensionality in high-dimensional spaces. Quantum
reinforcement learning (QRL) addresses this issue by leveraging superposition
and entanglement in quantum computing, allowing efficient handling of
high-dimensional problems with fewer resources. QRL combines quantum neural
networks (QNNs) with RL, where the parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) acts as
the core computational module. The PQC performs linear and nonlinear
transformations through gate operations, similar to hidden layers in classical
neural networks. Previous QRL studies, however, have used fixed PQC structures
based on empirical intuition without verifying their optimality. This paper
proposes a QRL-NAS algorithm that integrates quantum neural architecture search
(QNAS) to optimize PQC structures within QRL. Experiments demonstrate that
QRL-NAS achieves higher rewards than QRL with fixed circuits, validating its
effectiveness and practical utility.

Result: Audio-3DVG在音频定位任务中达到新SOTA，性能接近文本方法。

Conclusion: 研究表明，将语音整合到3D视觉任务中具有潜力。

Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) involves localizing target objects in 3D point
clouds based on natural language. While prior work has made strides using
textual descriptions, leveraging spoken language-known as Audio-based 3D Visual
Grounding-remains underexplored and challenging. Motivated by advances in
automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech representation learning, we
propose Audio-3DVG, a simple yet effective framework that integrates audio and
spatial information for enhanced grounding. Rather than treating speech as a
monolithic input, we decompose the task into two complementary components.
First, we introduce Object Mention Detection, a multi-label classification task
that explicitly identifies which objects are referred to in the audio, enabling
more structured audio-scene reasoning. Second, we propose an Audio-Guided
Attention module that captures interactions between candidate objects and
relational speech cues, improving target discrimination in cluttered scenes. To
support benchmarking, we synthesize audio descriptions for standard 3DVG
datasets, including ScanRefer, Sr3D, and Nr3D. Experimental results demonstrate
that Audio-3DVG not only achieves new state-of-the-art performance in
audio-based grounding, but also competes with text-based methods-highlighting
the promise of integrating spoken language into 3D vision tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 偏好强化学习在奖励信号难以明确的环境中表现优异，但存在收敛速度慢的问题。现有方法在预训练和微调时使用不同损失函数可能导致优化不可靠。

Method: 提出残差奖励模型（RRM），将真实奖励分解为先验奖励和学习奖励两部分。先验奖励可以是用户猜测或逆强化学习得到的奖励，学习奖励通过偏好训练。

Result: 在Meta-World环境中的实验表明，RRM显著提升了PbRL方法的性能，且适用于多种先验奖励类型。在真实机器人任务中也表现出色，学习速度更快。

Conclusion: RRM方法有效结合先验知识，显著提升了偏好强化学习的性能和收敛速度，适用于多种任务和场景。

Abstract: Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL) provides a way to learn
high-performance policies in environments where the reward signal is hard to
specify, avoiding heuristic and time-consuming reward design. However, PbRL can
suffer from slow convergence speed since it requires training in a reward
model. Prior work has proposed learning a reward model from demonstrations and
fine-tuning it using preferences. However, when the model is a neural network,
using different loss functions for pre-training and fine-tuning can pose
challenges to reliable optimization. In this paper, we propose a method to
effectively leverage prior knowledge with a Residual Reward Model (RRM). An RRM
assumes that the true reward of the environment can be split into a sum of two
parts: a prior reward and a learned reward. The prior reward is a term
available before training, for example, a user's ``best guess'' reward
function, or a reward function learned from inverse reinforcement learning
(IRL), and the learned reward is trained with preferences. We introduce
state-based and image-based versions of RRM and evaluate them on several tasks
in the Meta-World environment suite. Experimental results show that our method
substantially improves the performance of a common PbRL method. Our method
achieves performance improvements for a variety of different types of prior
rewards, including proxy rewards, a reward obtained from IRL, and even a
negated version of the proxy reward. We also conduct experiments with a Franka
Panda to show that our method leads to superior performance on a real robot. It
significantly accelerates policy learning for different tasks, achieving
success in fewer steps than the baseline. The videos are presented at

Result: 实验表明，该方法提高了分类器引导的稳定性，同时保持了样本多样性和视觉质量。

Conclusion: 该研究推动了生成模型中条件采样技术的发展，使更多类型的分类器可用作引导分类器。

Abstract: Classifier guidance is intended to steer a diffusion process such that a
given classifier reliably recognizes the generated data point as a certain
class. However, most classifier guidance approaches are restricted to robust
classifiers, which were specifically trained on the noise of the diffusion
forward process. We extend classifier guidance to work with general,
non-robust, classifiers that were trained without noise. We analyze the
sensitivity of both non-robust and robust classifiers to noise of the diffusion
process on the standard CelebA data set, the specialized SportBalls data set
and the high-dimensional real-world CelebA-HQ data set. Our findings reveal
that non-robust classifiers exhibit significant accuracy degradation under
noisy conditions, leading to unstable guidance gradients. To mitigate these
issues, we propose a method that utilizes one-step denoised image predictions
and implements stabilization techniques inspired by stochastic optimization
methods, such as exponential moving averages. Experimental results demonstrate
that our approach improves the stability of classifier guidance while
maintaining sample diversity and visual quality. This work contributes to
advancing conditional sampling techniques in generative models, enabling a
broader range of classifiers to be used as guidance classifiers.

Conclusion: 通过模拟人脑资源管理策略，CLAI框架为构建更高效、鲁棒和智能的AI系统提供了新思路。

Abstract: The escalating computational costs of Large Language Model (LLM) inference
have become a critical barrier to their widespread and sustainable deployment.
While existing optimization strategies are effective, they are predominantly
based on statistical heuristics or architectural modifications, lacking a
guiding cognitive theory to manage the inference process itself. This paper
aims to bridge this gap by introducing a novel paradigm: the Cognitive
Load-Aware Inference (CLAI) framework, which operationalizes principles from
Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) and neuroscience for LLM inference. We formalize
the concepts of Intrinsic Cognitive Load, Extraneous Cognitive Load, and
Germane Cognitive Load into quantifiable LLM metrics ($ICL_{LLM}$, $ECL_{LLM}$,
and $GCL_{LLM}$), thereby reframing the inference process as a cognitive
economics optimization problem: based on the intrinsic complexity of a problem
($ICL_{LLM}$), minimize wasteful computation ($ECL_{LLM}$), and strategically
allocate the token budget to productive reasoning ($GCL_{LLM}$). We propose two
implementation paths: CLAI-Prompt, a zero-shot method that guides a base LLM
through cognitive control steps via a structured meta-prompt, and CLAI-Tune, a
fine-tuned model that internalizes these principles for spontaneous cognitive
economy. Across a range of benchmarks in complex reasoning, long-context
question answering, and code generation, our methods achieve significant
reductions in token consumption (up to 45\%) without sacrificing accuracy.
Furthermore, CLAI-Tune exhibits an emergent ability to autonomously decompose
difficult problems, a key characteristic of human expert cognition. This work
demonstrates that by emulating the brain's resource management strategies, we
can build more efficient, robust, and capable artificial intelligence systems.

Result: 方法在准确性和延迟预测上表现优异，为学习DAG拓扑提供了新见解。

Conclusion: 通过改进拓扑表示，新方法有效解决了GNN和transformer的局限性，提升了预测性能。

Abstract: The growing use of deep learning necessitates efficient network design and
deployment, making neural predictors vital for estimating attributes such as
accuracy and latency. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and transformers
have shown promising performance in representing neural architectures. However,
each of both methods has its disadvantages. GNNs lack the capabilities to
represent complicated features, while transformers face poor generalization
when the depth of architecture grows. To mitigate the above issues, we rethink
neural architecture topology and show that sibling nodes are pivotal while
overlooked in previous research. We thus propose a novel predictor leveraging
the strengths of GNNs and transformers to learn the enhanced topology. We
introduce a novel token mixer that considers siblings, and a new channel mixer
named bidirectional graph isomorphism feed-forward network. Our approach
consistently achieves promising performance in both accuracy and latency
prediction, providing valuable insights for learning Directed Acyclic Graph
(DAG) topology. The code is available at https://github.com/XuRuihan/NNFormer.

Method: 采用强化学习（RL）方法，结合链式思维追踪和平衡安全性与任务完成的奖励信号，设计了三个关键步骤：轻量级SFT预热、混合提示训练和防止推理能力退化的奖励函数。

Result: TARS训练的模型在模糊查询上分配更多计算资源，实现了更好的安全性与拒绝的平衡，并提升了对抗攻击的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: TARS为训练LLM对抗越狱和有害请求提供了一种有效的开放式方法。

Abstract: Reasoning methods that adaptively allocate test-time compute have advanced
LLM performance on easy to verify domains such as math and code. In this work,
we study how to utilize this approach to train models that exhibit a degree of
robustness to safety vulnerabilities, and show that doing so can provide
benefits. We build a recipe called $\textit{TARS}$ (Training Adaptive Reasoners
for Safety), a reinforcement learning (RL) approach that trains models to
reason about safety using chain-of-thought traces and a reward signal that
balances safety with task completion. To build TARS, we identify three critical
design choices: (1) a "lightweight" warmstart SFT stage, (2) a mix of harmful,
harmless, and ambiguous prompts to prevent shortcut behaviors such as too many
refusals, and (3) a reward function to prevent degeneration of reasoning
capabilities during training. Models trained with TARS exhibit adaptive
behaviors by spending more compute on ambiguous queries, leading to better
safety-refusal trade-offs. They also internally learn to better distinguish
between safe and unsafe prompts and attain greater robustness to both white-box
(e.g., GCG) and black-box attacks (e.g., PAIR). Overall, our work provides an
effective, open recipe for training LLMs against jailbreaks and harmful
requests by reasoning per prompt.

Result: 幽灵扩展严格减少近似误差，且在收敛后与原始模型一致；训练加速且保持渐近行为。

Conclusion: 该框架为架构层面的干预提供了理论基础，优化了早期训练性能而不影响最终结果。

Abstract: Recent studies have proposed interpreting the training process from an
ergodic perspective. Building on this foundation we present a unified framework
for understanding and accelerating the training of deep neural networks via
stochastic gradient descent. By analyzing the geometric landscape of the
objective function we introduce a practical diagnostic, the running estimate of
the largest Lyapunov exponent, which provably distinguishes genuine convergence
toward stable minimizers from mere statistical stabilization near saddle
points. We then propose a ghost category extension for standard classifiers
that adds auxiliary ghost output nodes so the model gains extra descent
directions that open a lateral corridor around narrow loss barriers and enable
the optimizer to bypass poor basins during the early training phase. We show
that this extension strictly reduces approximation error and that after
sufficient convergence the ghost dimensions collapse and the extended model's
invariant law coincides with that of the original and there exists a path in
the enlarged parameter space along which the total loss does not increase while
the original loss decreases by an arbitrary margin. Taken together these
results provide a principled architecture level intervention that accelerates
early stage trainability while preserving asymptotic behavior.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has become a powerful tool for complex
decision-making in machine learning and AI. However, traditional methods often
assume perfect action execution, overlooking the uncertainties and deviations
between an agent's selected actions and the actual system response. In
real-world applications, such as robotics, mechatronics, and communication
networks, execution mismatches arising from system dynamics, hardware
constraints, and latency can significantly degrade performance. This work
advances AI by developing a novel control-optimized DRL framework that
explicitly models and compensates for action execution mismatches, a challenge
largely overlooked in existing methods. Our approach establishes a structured
two-stage process: determining the desired action and selecting the appropriate
control signal to ensure proper execution. It trains the agent while accounting
for action mismatches and controller corrections. By incorporating these
factors into the training process, the AI agent optimizes the desired action
with respect to both the actual control signal and the intended outcome,
explicitly considering execution errors. This approach enhances robustness,
ensuring that decision-making remains effective under real-world uncertainties.
Our approach offers a substantial advancement for engineering practice by
bridging the gap between idealized learning and real-world implementation. It
equips intelligent agents operating in engineering environments with the
ability to anticipate and adjust for actuation errors and system disturbances
during training. We evaluate the framework in five widely used open-source
mechanical simulation environments we restructured and developed to reflect
real-world operating conditions, showcasing its robustness against
uncertainties and offering a highly practical and efficient solution for
control-oriented applications.

Conclusion: RoboEval通过揭示失败原因，提供了更深入、可操作的机器人操作理解，强调了超越单纯成功率的评估工具的必要性。

Abstract: We present RoboEval, a simulation benchmark and structured evaluation
framework designed to reveal the limitations of current bimanual manipulation
policies. While prior benchmarks report only binary task success, we show that
such metrics often conceal critical weaknesses in policy behavior -- such as
poor coordination, slipping during grasping, or asymmetric arm usage. RoboEval
introduces a suite of tiered, semantically grounded tasks decomposed into
skill-specific stages, with variations that systematically challenge spatial,
physical, and coordination capabilities. Tasks are paired with fine-grained
diagnostic metrics and 3000+ human demonstrations to support imitation
learning. Our experiments reveal that policies with similar success rates
diverge in how tasks are executed -- some struggle with alignment, others with
temporally consistent bimanual control. We find that behavioral metrics
correlate with success in over half of task-metric pairs, and remain
informative even when binary success saturates. By pinpointing when and how
policies fail, RoboEval enables a deeper, more actionable understanding of
robotic manipulation -- and highlights the need for evaluation tools that go
beyond success alone.

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-agent systems manipulation have demonstrated a
rising demand for the implementation of multi-UAV systems in urban areas, which
are always subjected to the presence of static and dynamic obstacles. Inspired
by the collective behavior of tilapia fish and pigeons, the focus of the
presented research is on the introduction of a nature-inspired collision-free
formation control for a multi-UAV system, considering the obstacle avoidance
maneuvers. The developed framework in this study utilizes a semi-distributed
control approach, in which, based on a probabilistic Lloyd's algorithm, a
centralized guidance algorithm works for optimal positioning of the UAVs, while
a distributed control approach has been used for the intervehicle collision and
obstacle avoidance. Further, the presented framework has been extended to the
3D space with a novel definition of 3D maneuvers. Finally, the presented
framework has been applied to multi-UAV systems in 2D and 3D scenarios, and the
obtained results demonstrated the validity of the presented method in dynamic
environments with stationary and moving obstacles.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了两种新指标L-AP和P-AP，用于更全面地评估实时3D物体检测系统，考虑了硬件差异和运动规划的影响，并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D物体检测研究通常忽略速度与精度之间的权衡，以及硬件差异和运动规划的影响，这对自动驾驶系统的实时应用至关重要。

Method: 引入延迟感知AP（L-AP）和规划感知AP（P-AP）作为新指标，结合nuPlan数据集评估模型，并通过延迟感知超参数优化（L-HPO）开发高性能模型。

Result: 实验证明新指标的有效性，并优化了硬件和模型选择，同时纠正了‘点云越多性能越好’的错误假设。

Conclusion: 新指标为实时3D物体检测提供了更全面的评估方法，优化了自动驾驶系统的性能。

Abstract: High-accuracy and low-latency 3D object detection is essential for autonomous
driving systems. While previous studies on 3D object detection often evaluate
performance based on mean average precision (mAP) and latency, they typically
fail to address the trade-off between speed and accuracy, such as 60.0 mAP at
100 ms vs 61.0 mAP at 500 ms. A quantitative assessment of the trade-offs
between different hardware devices and accelerators remains unexplored, despite
being critical for real-time applications. Furthermore, they overlook the
impact on collision avoidance in motion planning, for example, 60.0 mAP leading
to safer motion planning or 61.0 mAP leading to high-risk motion planning. In
this paper, we introduce latency-aware AP (L-AP) and planning-aware AP (P-AP)
as new metrics, which consider the physical world such as the concept of time
and physical constraints, offering a more comprehensive evaluation for
real-time 3D object detection. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our metrics
for the entire autonomous driving system using nuPlan dataset, and evaluate 3D
object detection models accounting for hardware differences and accelerators.
We also develop a state-of-the-art performance model for real-time 3D object
detection through latency-aware hyperparameter optimization (L-HPO) using our
metrics. Additionally, we quantitatively demonstrate that the assumption "the
more point clouds, the better the recognition performance" is incorrect for
real-time applications and optimize both hardware and model selection using our
metrics.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种隐式注入3D几何特征的模块，显著提升了Vision-Language-Action (VLA)模型在空间理解任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Vision-Language Models (VLMs)缺乏精确的空间理解能力，需要额外的3D输入，而本文旨在通过隐式方法解决这一问题。

Method: 利用现成的视觉几何基础模型，设计了一个即插即用的模块，隐式注入3D几何特征到VLA模型中。

Result: 在五个空间挑战任务中，该方法显著提升了VLA模型的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法无需额外传感器或缺陷估计，有效增强了VLA模型的空间理解能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a promising framework for
enabling generalist robots capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting in the
real world. These models usually build upon pretrained Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), which excel at semantic understanding due to large-scale text
pretraining. However, VLMs typically lack precise spatial understanding
capabilities, as they are primarily tuned on 2D image-text pairs without 3D
supervision. To address this limitation, recent approaches have incorporated
explicit 3D inputs such as point clouds or depth maps, but this necessitates
additional depth sensors or defective estimation. In contrast, our work
introduces a plug-and-play module that implicitly injects 3D geometry features
into VLA models by leveraging an off-the-shelf visual geometry foundation
models. We design five spatially challenging tasks that require precise spatial
understanding ability to validate effectiveness of our method. Extensive
evaluations show that our method significantly improves the performance of
state-of-the-art VLA models across diverse scenarios.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合机器学习和传统算法的眼动追踪方法，解决了手术机器人导航中的眼动估计问题，提高了精度和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有眼动估计技术依赖额外传感器或面部检测，且在手术环境中易受遮挡和光线变化影响，限制了术前导航的准确性和一致性。

Method: 结合机器学习和传统算法，无需依赖标志点，能在不同光照和阴影条件下稳定检测虹膜并估计视线方向。

Result: 实验显示，眼动方向估计平均误差为0.58度，基于估计方向的机械臂运动控制平均误差为2.08度。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了手术机器人导航的精确性和稳定性，解决了现有技术的局限性。

Abstract: Ophthalmic surgical robots offer superior stability and precision by reducing
the natural hand tremors of human surgeons, enabling delicate operations in
confined surgical spaces. Despite the advancements in developing vision- and
force-based control methods for surgical robots, preoperative navigation
remains heavily reliant on manual operation, limiting the consistency and
increasing the uncertainty. Existing eye gaze estimation techniques in the
surgery, whether traditional or deep learning-based, face challenges including
dependence on additional sensors, occlusion issues in surgical environments,
and the requirement for facial detection. To address these limitations, this
study proposes an innovative eye localization and tracking method that combines
machine learning with traditional algorithms, eliminating the requirements of
landmarks and maintaining stable iris detection and gaze estimation under
varying lighting and shadow conditions. Extensive real-world experiment results
show that our proposed method has an average estimation error of 0.58 degrees
for eye orientation estimation and 2.08-degree average control error for the
robotic arm's movement based on the calculated orientation.

Motivation: 现有基于激光雷达和摄像头的解决方案在视觉遮挡环境中性能不佳，计算开销大且成本高，而毫米波雷达传感器虽成本低但存在点云稀疏、噪声和误检问题。

Method: 提出RaGNNarok框架，利用图神经网络实时增强雷达点云，适用于复杂动态环境，并在低成本设备上高效运行。

Result: 在三种不同环境中测试了定位、SLAM和自主导航任务，表现出高可靠性和泛化能力，推理时间仅7.3毫秒。

Conclusion: RaGNNarok为低成本室内移动机器人提供了一种鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Low-cost indoor mobile robots have gained popularity with the increasing
adoption of automation in homes and commercial spaces. However, existing lidar
and camera-based solutions have limitations such as poor performance in
visually obscured environments, high computational overhead for data
processing, and high costs for lidars. In contrast, mmWave radar sensors offer
a cost-effective and lightweight alternative, providing accurate ranging
regardless of visibility. However, existing radar-based localization suffers
from sparse point cloud generation, noise, and false detections. Thus, in this
work, we introduce RaGNNarok, a real-time, lightweight, and generalizable graph
neural network (GNN)-based framework to enhance radar point clouds, even in
complex and dynamic environments. With an inference time of just 7.3 ms on the
low-cost Raspberry Pi 5, RaGNNarok runs efficiently even on such
resource-constrained devices, requiring no additional computational resources.
We evaluate its performance across key tasks, including localization, SLAM, and
autonomous navigation, in three different environments. Our results demonstrate
strong reliability and generalizability, making RaGNNarok a robust solution for
low-cost indoor mobile robots.

Abstract: Modern warehouse automation systems rely on fleets of intelligent robots that
generate vast amounts of data -- most of which remains unannotated. This paper
develops a self-supervised domain adaptation pipeline that leverages
real-world, unlabeled data to improve perception models without requiring
manual annotations. Our work focuses specifically on estimating the pose and
shape of boxes and presents a correct-and-certify pipeline for self-supervised
box pose and shape estimation. We extensively evaluate our approach across a
range of simulated and real industrial settings, including adaptation to a
large-scale real-world dataset of 50,000 images. The self-supervised model
significantly outperforms models trained solely in simulation and shows
substantial improvements over a zero-shot 3D bounding box estimation baseline.

Result: 生成的视频效果与真实演示相当，性能随生成质量提升，优于关键点预测等方法。

Conclusion: AI生成的视频可作为机器人操作的有效监督来源。

Abstract: This work introduces Robots Imitating Generated Videos (RIGVid), a system
that enables robots to perform complex manipulation tasks--such as pouring,
wiping, and mixing--purely by imitating AI-generated videos, without requiring
any physical demonstrations or robot-specific training. Given a language
command and an initial scene image, a video diffusion model generates potential
demonstration videos, and a vision-language model (VLM) automatically filters
out results that do not follow the command. A 6D pose tracker then extracts
object trajectories from the video, and the trajectories are retargeted to the
robot in an embodiment-agnostic fashion. Through extensive real-world
evaluations, we show that filtered generated videos are as effective as real
demonstrations, and that performance improves with generation quality. We also
show that relying on generated videos outperforms more compact alternatives
such as keypoint prediction using VLMs, and that strong 6D pose tracking
outperforms other ways to extract trajectories, such as dense feature point
tracking. These findings suggest that videos produced by a state-of-the-art
off-the-shelf model can offer an effective source of supervision for robotic
manipulation.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an innovative vector quantization based action
tokenizer built upon the largest-scale action trajectory dataset to date,
leveraging over 100 times more data than previous approaches. This extensive
dataset enables our tokenizer to capture rich spatiotemporal dynamics,
resulting in a model that not only accelerates inference but also generates
smoother and more coherent action outputs. Once trained, the tokenizer can be
seamlessly adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks in a zero-shot manner,
from short-horizon reactive behaviors to long-horizon planning. A key finding
of our work is that the domain gap between synthetic and real action
trajectories is marginal, allowing us to effectively utilize a vast amount of
synthetic data during training without compromising real-world performance. To
validate our approach, we conducted extensive experiments in both simulated
environments and on real robotic platforms. The results demonstrate that as the
volume of synthetic trajectory data increases, the performance of our tokenizer
on downstream tasks improves significantly-most notably, achieving up to a 30%
higher success rate on two real-world tasks in long-horizon scenarios. These
findings highlight the potential of our action tokenizer as a robust and
scalable solution for real-time embodied intelligence systems, paving the way
for more efficient and reliable robotic control in diverse application

Result: 仿真和实验表明，PI-WAN在预测精度、跟踪性能和鲁棒性上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: PI-WAN有效结合物理与数据驱动方法，显著提升四旋翼在未知环境中的性能。

Abstract: Accurate dynamics modeling is essential for quadrotors to achieve precise
trajectory tracking in various applications. Traditional physical
knowledge-driven modeling methods face substantial limitations in unknown
environments characterized by variable payloads, wind disturbances, and
external perturbations. On the other hand, data-driven modeling methods suffer
from poor generalization when handling out-of-distribution (OoD) data,
restricting their effectiveness in unknown scenarios. To address these
challenges, we introduce the Physics-Informed Wind-Adaptive Network (PI-WAN),
which combines knowledge-driven and data-driven modeling methods by embedding
physical constraints directly into the training process for robust quadrotor
dynamics learning. Specifically, PI-WAN employs a Temporal Convolutional
Network (TCN) architecture that efficiently captures temporal dependencies from
historical flight data, while a physics-informed loss function applies physical
principles to improve model generalization and robustness across previously
unseen conditions. By incorporating real-time prediction results into a model
predictive control (MPC) framework, we achieve improvements in closed-loop
tracking performance. Comprehensive simulations and real-world flight
experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms baseline methods in terms
of prediction accuracy, tracking precision, and robustness to unknown
environments.

Conclusion: HumanoidGen填补了双手机器人操作任务的空白，为相关研究提供了新基准。

Abstract: For robotic manipulation, existing robotics datasets and simulation
benchmarks predominantly cater to robot-arm platforms. However, for humanoid
robots equipped with dual arms and dexterous hands, simulation tasks and
high-quality demonstrations are notably lacking. Bimanual dexterous
manipulation is inherently more complex, as it requires coordinated arm
movements and hand operations, making autonomous data collection challenging.
This paper presents HumanoidGen, an automated task creation and demonstration
collection framework that leverages atomic dexterous operations and LLM
reasoning to generate relational constraints. Specifically, we provide spatial
annotations for both assets and dexterous hands based on the atomic operations,
and perform an LLM planner to generate a chain of actionable spatial
constraints for arm movements based on object affordances and scenes. To
further improve planning ability, we employ a variant of Monte Carlo tree
search to enhance LLM reasoning for long-horizon tasks and insufficient
annotation. In experiments, we create a novel benchmark with augmented
scenarios to evaluate the quality of the collected data. The results show that
the performance of the 2D and 3D diffusion policies can scale with the
generated dataset. Project page is https://openhumanoidgen.github.io.

Conclusion: 未来需关注复杂性管理、几何无关表示、制造约束集成和多物理场协同设计的进展。

Abstract: Inverse design in nanophotonics, the computational discovery of structures
achieving targeted electromagnetic (EM) responses, has become a key tool for
recent optical advances. Traditional intuition-driven or iterative optimization
methods struggle with the inherently high-dimensional, non-convex design spaces
and the substantial computational demands of EM simulations. Recently, machine
learning (ML) has emerged to address these bottlenecks effectively. This review
frames ML-enhanced inverse design methodologies through the lens of
representation learning, classifying them into two categories: output-side and
input-side approaches. Output-side methods use ML to learn a representation in
the solution space to create a differentiable solver that accelerates
optimization. Conversely, input-side techniques employ ML to learn compact,
latent-space representations of feasible device geometries, enabling efficient
global exploration through generative models. Each strategy presents unique
trade-offs in data requirements, generalization capacity, and novel design
discovery potentials. Hybrid frameworks that combine physics-based optimization
with data-driven representations help escape poor local optima, improve
scalability, and facilitate knowledge transfer. We conclude by highlighting
open challenges and opportunities, emphasizing complexity management,
geometry-independent representations, integration of fabrication constraints,
and advancements in multiphysics co-designs.

Abstract: Accurate molecular property predictions require 3D geometries, which are
typically obtained using expensive methods such as density functional theory
(DFT). Here, we attempt to obtain molecular geometries by relying solely on
machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) models. To this end, we first
curate a large-scale molecular relaxation dataset comprising 3.5 million
molecules and 300 million snapshots. Then MLIP foundation models are trained
with supervised learning to predict energy and forces given 3D molecular
structures. Once trained, we show that the foundation models can be used in
different ways to obtain geometries either explicitly or implicitly. First, it
can be used to obtain low-energy 3D geometries via geometry optimization,
providing relaxed 3D geometries for downstream molecular property predictions.
To mitigate potential biases and enhance downstream predictions, we introduce
geometry fine-tuning based on the relaxed 3D geometries. Second, the foundation
models can be directly fine-tuned for property prediction when ground truth 3D
geometries are available. Our results demonstrate that MLIP foundation models
trained on relaxation data can provide valuable molecular geometries that
benefit property predictions.

Conclusion: VLTL-Bench填补了现有研究的不足，为可验证的NL-to-LTL翻译方法提供了方法论支持。

Abstract: Empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art natural-language (NL) to
temporal-logic (TL) translation systems reveals near-perfect performance on
existing benchmarks. However, current studies measure only the accuracy of the
translation of NL logic into formal TL, ignoring a system's capacity to ground
atomic propositions into new scenarios or environments. This is a critical
feature, necessary for the verification of resulting formulas in a concrete
state space. Consequently, most NL-to-TL translation frameworks propose their
own bespoke dataset in which the correct grounding is known a-priori, inflating
performance metrics and neglecting the need for extensible, domain-general
systems. In this paper, we introduce the Verifiable Linear Temporal Logic
Benchmark ( VLTL-Bench), a unifying benchmark that measures verification and
verifiability of automated NL-to-LTL translation. The dataset consists of three
unique state spaces and thousands of diverse natural language specifications
and corresponding formal specifications in temporal logic. Moreover, the
benchmark contains sample traces to validate the temporal logic expressions.
While the benchmark directly supports end-to-end evaluation, we observe that
many frameworks decompose the process into i) lifting, ii) grounding, iii)
translation, and iv) verification. The benchmark provides ground truths after
each of these steps to enable researches to improve and evaluate different
substeps of the overall problem. To encourage methodologically sound advances
in verifiable NL-to-LTL translation approaches, we release VLTL-Bench here:

Result: 仿真显示CaaS显著提升服务率并降低切换开销。

Conclusion: CaaS是管理多星座DS2D通信的高效可持续解决方案。

Abstract: Direct-satellite-to-device (DS2D) communication is emerging as a promising
solution for global mobile service extension, leveraging the deployment of
satellite constellations. However, the challenge of managing DS2D connectivity
for multi-constellations becomes outstanding, including high interference and
frequent handovers caused by multi-coverage overlap and rapid satellite
movement. Moreover, existing approaches primarily operate within
single-constellation shell, which inherently limits the ability to exploit the
vast potential of multi-constellation connectivity provision, resulting in
suboptimal DS2D service performances. To address these challenges, this article
proposes a Constellation as a Service (CaaS) framework, which treats the entire
multi-constellation infrastructure as a shared resource pool and dynamically
forms optimal sub-constellations (SCs) for each DS2D service region. The
formation of each SC integrates satellites from various orbits to provide
tailored connectivity based on user demands, guided by two innovative
strategies: predictive satellite beamforming using generative artificial
intelligence (GenAI) and pre-configured handover path for efficient satellite
access and mobility management. Simulation results demonstrate that CaaS
significantly improves satellite service rates while reducing handover
overhead, making it an efficient and continuable solution for managing DS2D
connectivity in multi-constellation environments.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为“不连贯性”的度量方法，用于在没有正确实现（oracle）的情况下量化LLM生成代码的错误概率，实验证明其高效且可靠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM生成的代码可能存在语法正确但事实错误的问题，需要一种无需oracle的方法来评估其正确性。

Method: 提出“不连贯性”作为错误概率的下界估计，并通过实验验证其有效性。

Result: 实验显示，该方法能自动识别约三分之二的错误程序，且无假阳性报告，与oracle评估结果高度一致。

Conclusion: 不连贯性评估可替代oracle评估，为LLM生成代码的正确性提供可靠度量。

Abstract: Generating code from natural language specifications is one of the most
successful applications of Large Language Models (LLMs). Yet, they hallucinate:
LLMs produce outputs that may be grammatically correct but are factually
incorrect. Without an existing, correct implementation (i.e., an oracle), can
we quantify how likely the generated program is correct?
  In this paper, we propose a measure of incorrectness, called incoherence,
that can be estimated efficiently in the absence of an oracle and provides a
lower bound on the error, i.e., the probability that the LLM-generated program
for that specification is incorrect. Our experiments demonstrate an
extraordinary effectiveness. For the average code generation task, our
incoherence-based methodology can automatically identify about two-thirds of
incorrect programs without reports of false positives. In fact, an oracle-based
evaluation of LLMs can be reliably replaced by an incoherence-based evaluation.
In particular, we find a very strong agreement between the ranking of LLMs by
the number of programs deemed correct via an oracle (pass@1) and the ranking of
LLMs by the number of programs deemed correct via our incoherence.

### [236] [Integrating Universal Generative AI Platforms in Educational Labs to Foster Critical Thinking and Digital Literacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00007)
*Vasiliy Znamenskiy,Rafael Niyazov,Joel Hernandez*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 提出了一种将生成式人工智能（GenAI）平台融入实验室活动的新教育框架，旨在培养本科生的批判性思维和数字素养。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 认识到对大型语言模型（LLM）不加批判依赖的局限性和风险，重新将GenAI定义为研究主题和认知工具。

Method: 学生制定学科特定的提示，并评估GenAI生成的文本、图像和视频响应。在非理科专业的普通天文学课程中进行了试点。

Result: 试点显示学生参与度高且能进行批判性反思，许多学生在课后继续活动并在研究研讨会上展示成果。

Conclusion: 结构化AI互动在教育中很重要，结合反思性评估方法可提升学习效果，提出了可复制的跨学科AI整合实验室模型。

Abstract: This paper presents a new educational framework for integrating generative
artificial intelligence (GenAI) platforms such as ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini
into laboratory activities aimed at developing critical thinking and digital
literacy among undergraduate students. Recognizing the limitations and risks of
uncritical reliance on large language models (LLMs), the proposed pedagogical
model reframes GenAI as a research subject and cognitive tool. Students
formulate discipline-specific prompts and evaluate GenAI-generated responses in
text, image, and video modalities. A pilot implementation in a general
astronomy course for non-science majors demonstrated high levels of engagement
and critical reflection, with many students continuing the activity after class
and presenting results at a research symposium. The results highlight the
importance of structured AI interactions in education and suggest that GenAI
can improve learning outcomes when combined with reflective assessment methods.
The study proposes a replicable model for interdisciplinary AI-integrated lab
work, adaptable to scientific disciplines. See the guide to learning activities
based on Generative-Ai platforms: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15555802

*Grey Kuling,Marinka Zitnik*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: KUL-KT是一种受生物启发的知识追踪架构，结合了Hebbian记忆编码和基于梯度的巩固方法，具有可扩展性和输入无关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过模拟神经系统的记忆巩固机制，改进学生建模，实现持续学习和自然遗忘。

Method: 采用时间衰减的Hebbian记忆更新和Loss-aligned Internal Target (LIT)方法，结合快速Hebbian记忆和慢速线性网络。

Result: 在十个公开KT基准测试中表现优异，训练速度更快且内存占用更少，实际课堂部署中显著提升学习效果。

Conclusion: KUL-KT是一种高效、灵活且可扩展的个性化学习框架。

Abstract: We introduce KUL-KT, a biologically inspired architecture for knowledge
tracing (KT), combining Hebbian memory encoding with gradient-based
consolidation in a scalable, input-agnostic framework. KUL-KT adapts the
principle of memory consolidation in neural systems, to student modeling by
introducing two key innovations: (i) a time-decaying Hebbian memory update that
enables graceful forgetting, and (ii) a novel Loss-aligned Internal Target
(LIT) method to compute an ideal internal state, allowing continual learning
without backpropagation through time. The architecture consists of a fast
Hebbian memory that captures each learner interaction via a single associative
update, and a slower linear network that consolidates recalled samples through
gradient descent. This design enables few-shot personalization and natural
forgetting without storing raw data or relying on large cohort training.
Operating entirely in embedding space, KUL-KT supports both structured
(tabular) and unstructured (short-answer) inputs. Empirically, KUL-KT
outperforms strong baselines on ten public KT benchmarks in rank-sensitive
metrics such as nDCG and Recall@10. In a classroom deployment, KUL-KT
personalized quizzes from short-answer data, leading to improved
learner-perceived helpfulness and reduced difficulty (p < 0.05). Ablation
studies confirm that Hebbian decay and LIT are critical for continual
adaptation. Compared to a strong graph-based KT model, KUL-KT trains 1.75x
faster and uses 99.01\% less memory. These results position KUL-KT as a
biologically grounded, memory-efficient, and input-flexible framework for
personalized learning at scale.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 本文探讨了生成式人工智能对编程教育的变革，提出通过代码理解和执行（而非单纯编码）来改进教学方法，并推荐使用可视化工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究生成式AI对编程教育的影响，探索更有效的教学方法。

Method: 综述相关研究，提出基于代码理解和可视化的教学方法，并结合学生反馈验证。

Result: 可视化工具能提升学生对代码的理解，学生反馈支持其纳入教学。

Conclusion: 建议在编程教学中融入可视化工具，以深化学生对代码的理解和执行能力。

Abstract: Computer programming is undergoing a true transformation driven by powerful
new tools for automatic source code generation based on large language models.
This transformation is also manifesting in introductory programming courses at
universities around the world, generating an in-depth debate about how
programming content should be taught, learned, and assessed in the context of
generative artificial intelligence.
  This article aims, on the one hand, to review the most relevant studies on
this issue, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages identified in the
specialized literature. On the other hand, it proposes enriching teaching and
learning methodologies by focusing on code comprehension and execution rather
than on mere coding or program functionality. In particular, it advocates for
the use of visual representations of code and visual simulations of its
execution as effective tools for teaching, learning, and assessing programming,
thus fostering a deeper understanding among students.
  Finally, the opinions of students who took the object-oriented programming
course are presented to provide preliminary context supporting the
incorporation of visual simulations in Java (or other languages) as part of the
training process.

methods aimed at uncovering hidden patterns among the SM constants, or
potentially used as building blocks for a deeper underlying law that connects
all parameters of the SM through a small set of fundamental constants.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 论文提出两种新型复数Hopfield神经网络（CvHNNs），通过相位和幅度量化增加状态数，扩展应用范围。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有复数Hopfield神经网络的状态数有限，限制了其应用潜力。

Method: 第一种CvHNN基于矩形坐标表示，使用天花板型激活函数；第二种基于极坐标表示，同样采用相位和幅度量化。

Result: 提出的CvHNNs显著增加了状态数，优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 相位和幅度量化的CvHNNs扩展了Hopfield神经网络的应用潜力。

Abstract: This research paper introduces two novel complex-valued Hopfield neural
networks (CvHNNs) that incorporate phase and magnitude quantization. The first
CvHNN employs a ceiling-type activation function that operates on the
rectangular coordinate representation of the complex net contribution. The
second CvHNN similarly incorporates phase and magnitude quantization but
utilizes a ceiling-type activation function based on the polar coordinate
representation of the complex net contribution. The proposed CvHNNs, with their
phase and magnitude quantization, significantly increase the number of states
compared to existing models in the literature, thereby expanding the range of
potential applications for CvHNNs.

*Madison Cotteret,Christopher J. Kymn,Hugh Greatorex,Martin Ziegler,Elisabetta Chicca,Friedrich T. Sommer*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于稀疏二进制分布式编码的连续吸引子网络（CANs），解决了传统模型在稳定性和分辨率之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统连续吸引子网络（CANs）对噪声和异质性非常敏感，导致稳定性和分辨率之间的困境。

Method: 采用稀疏二进制分布式编码，基于随机特征嵌入，模拟网格细胞样编码。

Result: 理论和仿真表明，该方法能同时实现高稳定性和高分辨率，并可扩展到非线性流形。

Conclusion: 该研究为大脑如何高分辨率、稳定地表示连续变量提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Continuous attractor networks (CANs) are widely used to model how the brain
temporarily retains continuous behavioural variables via persistent recurrent
activity, such as an animal's position in an environment. However, this memory
mechanism is very sensitive to even small imperfections, such as noise or
heterogeneity, which are both common in biological systems. Previous work has
shown that discretising the continuum into a finite set of discrete attractor
states provides robustness to these imperfections, but necessarily reduces the
resolution of the represented variable, creating a dilemma between stability
and resolution. We show that this stability-resolution dilemma is most severe
for CANs using unimodal bump-like codes, as in traditional models. To overcome
this, we investigate sparse binary distributed codes based on random feature
embeddings, in which neurons have spatially-periodic receptive fields. We
demonstrate theoretically and with simulations that such grid-cell-like codes
enable CANs to achieve both high stability and high resolution simultaneously.
The model extends to embedding arbitrary nonlinear manifolds into a CAN, such
as spheres or tori, and generalises linear path integration to integration
along freely-programmable on-manifold vector fields. Together, this work
provides a theory of how the brain could robustly represent continuous
variables with high resolution and perform flexible computations over
task-relevant manifolds.

Conclusion: Transformer架构在符号音乐节拍跟踪中具有潜力，未来可与自动音乐转录系统结合以提升音乐分析和乐谱生成。

Abstract: Beat tracking in musical performance MIDI is a challenging and important task
for notation-level music transcription and rhythmical analysis, yet existing
methods primarily focus on audio-based approaches. This paper proposes an
end-to-end transformer-based model for beat and downbeat tracking in
performance MIDI, leveraging an encoder-decoder architecture for
sequence-to-sequence translation of MIDI input to beat annotations. Our
approach introduces novel data preprocessing techniques, including dynamic
augmentation and optimized tokenization strategies, to improve accuracy and
generalizability across different datasets. We conduct extensive experiments
using the A-MAPS, ASAP, GuitarSet, and Leduc datasets, comparing our model
against state-of-the-art hidden Markov models (HMMs) and deep learning-based
beat tracking methods. The results demonstrate that our model outperforms
existing symbolic music beat tracking approaches, achieving competitive
F1-scores across various musical styles and instruments. Our findings highlight
the potential of transformer architectures for symbolic beat tracking and
suggest future integration with automatic music transcription systems for
enhanced music analysis and score generation.

Method: 利用大语言模型（LLM）进行特征提取，并结合传统声学和语义特征。

Result: 在SW1挑战中，该方法取得了74%的准确率，排名第一。

approach leverages large language model (LLM) as the primary tool for feature
extraction, alongside conventional acoustic and semantic features. The proposed
method achieves an accuracy of 74\% on the test set, ranking first in the SW1

TL;DR: 提出了一种支持多步交互的TTS方法，允许用户直观快速地细化合成语音，模拟语音导演与演员的互动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TTS系统缺乏对合成语音风格的细粒度迭代优化，无法满足用户对语音风格的精确需求。

Method: 提出了一种多步交互的TTS方法，模拟语音导演与演员的互动关系，支持用户对合成语音进行迭代风格优化。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能够根据用户指示实现迭代风格优化，展示了多步交互能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为TTS系统提供了更灵活的语音风格优化能力，提升了用户体验。

Abstract: Voice directors often iteratively refine voice actors' performances by
providing feedback to achieve the desired outcome. While this iterative
feedback-based refinement process is important in actual recordings, it has
been overlooked in text-to-speech synthesis (TTS). As a result, fine-grained
style refinement after the initial synthesis is not possible, even though the
synthesized speech often deviates from the user's intended style. To address
this issue, we propose a TTS method with multi-step interaction that allows
users to intuitively and rapidly refine synthetized speech. Our approach models
the interaction between the TTS model and its user to emulate the relationship
between voice actors and voice directors. Experiments show that the proposed
model with its corresponding dataset enable iterative style refinements in
accordance with users' directions, thus demonstrating its multi-interaction
capability. Sample audios are available: https://ntt-hilab-gensp.

TL;DR: CTFT-Net是一种用于语音超分辨率的复杂时频变换网络，通过同时重建幅度和相位，显著提升了语音质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音超分辨率方法主要关注幅度重建，而忽略了相位重建对感知质量的重要性。

Method: CTFT-Net结合了复杂全局注意力块和复杂Conformer模块，建模音素间和频率间依赖关系，并采用时域和多分辨率频域损失函数。

Result: 在VCTK数据集上，CTFT-Net在极端上采样任务（2 kHz到48 kHz）中优于现有模型（如NU-Wave、WSRGlow等），有效重建高频且无噪声伪影。

Conclusion: CTFT-Net通过复杂域重建和新型网络结构，显著提升了语音超分辨率的性能和质量。

Abstract: Speech super-resolution (SSR) enhances low-resolution speech by increasing
the sampling rate. While most SSR methods focus on magnitude reconstruction,
recent research highlights the importance of phase reconstruction for improved
perceptual quality. Therefore, we introduce CTFT-Net, a Complex Time-Frequency
Transformation Network that reconstructs both magnitude and phase in complex
domains for improved SSR tasks. It incorporates a complex global attention
block to model inter-phoneme and inter-frequency dependencies and a complex
conformer to capture long-range and local features, improving frequency
reconstruction and noise robustness. CTFT-Net employs time-domain and
multi-resolution frequency-domain loss functions for better generalization.
Experiments show CTFT-Net outperforms state-of-the-art models (NU-Wave,
WSRGlow, NVSR, AERO) on the VCTK dataset, particularly for extreme upsampling
(2 kHz to 48 kHz), reconstructing high frequencies effectively without noisy

### [246] [MuteSwap: Silent Face-based Voice Conversion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00498)
*Yifan Liu,Yu Fang,Zhouhan Lin*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: MuteSwap框架通过视觉输入实现无声视频的语音转换，解决了传统方法依赖音频输入的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语音转换依赖干净音频输入，但在无声视频或嘈杂环境中不可行，因此需要仅基于视觉输入的解决方案。

Method: 提出MuteSwap框架，利用对比学习对齐跨模态身份，并通过最小化互信息分离共享视觉特征。

Result: MuteSwap在语音合成和身份转换中表现优异，尤其在嘈杂环境下优于依赖音频的方法。

Conclusion: MuteSwap证明了仅基于视觉输入的语音转换的可行性，并展示了其训练方法的有效性。

Abstract: Conventional voice conversion modifies voice characteristics from a source
speaker to a target speaker, relying on audio input from both sides. However,
this process becomes infeasible when clean audio is unavailable, such as in
silent videos or noisy environments. In this work, we focus on the task of
Silent Face-based Voice Conversion (SFVC), which does voice conversion entirely
from visual inputs. i.e., given images of a target speaker and a silent video
of a source speaker containing lip motion, SFVC generates speech aligning the
identity of the target speaker while preserving the speech content in the
source silent video. As this task requires generating intelligible speech and
converting identity using only visual cues, it is particularly challenging. To
address this, we introduce MuteSwap, a novel framework that employs contrastive
learning to align cross-modality identities and minimize mutual information to
separate shared visual features. Experimental results show that MuteSwap
achieves impressive performance in both speech synthesis and identity
conversion, especially under noisy conditions where methods dependent on audio
input fail to produce intelligible results, demonstrating both the
effectiveness of our training approach and the feasibility of SFVC.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型混合架构MambAttention，结合Mamba和共享时频多头注意力模块，显著提升了单通道语音增强的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有序列模型（如LSTM和Mamba）在训练集上过拟合的问题，探索混合Mamba与时频注意力模型的潜力。

Method: 提出MambAttention架构，结合Mamba和共享时频多头注意力模块，并使用VB-DemandEx数据集进行训练。

Result: 在VB-DemandEx数据集上表现优异，并在两个域外数据集（DNS 2020和EARS-WHAM_v2）上显著优于现有模型。

Conclusion: MambAttention模型在泛化性能上表现最佳，共享时频注意力模块对性能提升至关重要。

Abstract: With the advent of new sequence models like Mamba and xLSTM, several studies
have shown that these models match or outperform state-of-the-art models in
single-channel speech enhancement, automatic speech recognition, and
self-supervised audio representation learning. However, prior research has
demonstrated that sequence models like LSTM and Mamba tend to overfit to the
training set. To address this issue, previous works have shown that adding
self-attention to LSTMs substantially improves generalization performance for
single-channel speech enhancement. Nevertheless, neither the concept of hybrid
Mamba and time-frequency attention models nor their generalization performance
have been explored for speech enhancement. In this paper, we propose a novel
hybrid architecture, MambAttention, which combines Mamba and shared time- and
frequency-multi-head attention modules for generalizable single-channel speech
enhancement. To train our model, we introduce VoiceBank+Demand Extended
(VB-DemandEx), a dataset inspired by VoiceBank+Demand but with more challenging
noise types and lower signal-to-noise ratios. Trained on VB-DemandEx, our
proposed MambAttention model significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art LSTM-, xLSTM-, Mamba-, and Conformer-based systems of similar
complexity across all reported metrics on two out-of-domain datasets: DNS 2020
and EARS-WHAM_v2, while matching their performance on the in-domain dataset
VB-DemandEx. Ablation studies highlight the role of weight sharing between the
time- and frequency-multi-head attention modules for generalization
performance. Finally, we explore integrating the shared time- and
frequency-multi-head attention modules with LSTM and xLSTM, which yields a
notable performance improvement on the out-of-domain datasets. However, our
MambAttention model remains superior on both out-of-domain datasets across all
reported evaluation metrics.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）对人类合作行为的影响，发现LLMs在评估合作行为时存在差异，可能影响长期合作动态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着人类越来越依赖LLMs支持社会决策，研究其长期对社会合作的影响变得迫切。

Method: 通过21种LLMs评估不同社交情境下的合作行为，并结合进化博弈论模型分析合作动态。

Result: LLMs在评估合作行为时对良好对手表现一致，但对声誉不佳的个体存在差异，这些差异显著影响合作率。

Conclusion: 研究强调需要谨慎调整LLM规范，以维护人类合作行为。

Abstract: Humans increasingly rely on large language models (LLMs) to support decisions
in social settings. Previous work suggests that such tools shape people's moral
and political judgements. However, the long-term implications of LLM-based
social decision-making remain unknown. How will human cooperation be affected
when the assessment of social interactions relies on language models? This is a
pressing question, as human cooperation is often driven by indirect
reciprocity, reputations, and the capacity to judge interactions of others.
Here, we assess how state-of-the-art LLMs judge cooperative actions. We provide
21 different LLMs with an extensive set of examples where individuals cooperate
-- or refuse cooperating -- in a range of social contexts, and ask how these
interactions should be judged. Furthermore, through an evolutionary
game-theoretical model, we evaluate cooperation dynamics in populations where
the extracted LLM-driven judgements prevail, assessing the long-term impact of
LLMs on human prosociality. We observe a remarkable agreement in evaluating
cooperation against good opponents. On the other hand, we notice within- and
between-model variance when judging cooperation with ill-reputed individuals.
We show that the differences revealed between models can significantly impact
the prevalence of cooperation. Finally, we test prompts to steer LLM norms,
showing that such interventions can shape LLM judgements, particularly through
goal-oriented prompts. Our research connects LLM-based advices and long-term
social dynamics, and highlights the need to carefully align LLM norms in order
to preserve human cooperation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于网络的代币化生态系统中信任问题，如链下资产数据验证和监管合规性。

Conclusion: 结合AI治理、多智能体系统和区块链，显著增强代币化资产生态系统的信任，为实践者提供安全合规的框架。

Abstract: Alternative Assets tokenization is transforming non-traditional financial
instruments are represented and traded on the web. However, ensuring
trustworthiness in web-based tokenized ecosystems poses significant challenges,
from verifying off-chain asset data to enforcing regulatory compliance. This
paper proposes an AI-governed agent architecture that integrates intelligent
agents with blockchain to achieve web-trustworthy tokenization of alternative
assets. In the proposed architecture, autonomous agents orchestrate the
tokenization process (asset verification, valuation, compliance checking, and
lifecycle management), while an AI-driven governance layer monitors agent
behavior and enforces trust through adaptive policies and cryptoeconomic
incentives. We demonstrate that this approach enhances transparency, security,
and compliance in asset tokenization, addressing key concerns around data
authenticity and fraud. A case study on tokenizing real estate assets
illustrates how the architecture mitigates risks (e.g., fraudulent listings and
money laundering) through real-time AI anomaly detection and on-chain
enforcement. Our evaluation and analysis suggest that combining AI governance
with multi-agent systems and blockchain can significantly bolster trust in
tokenized asset ecosystems. This work offers a novel framework for trustworthy
asset tokenization on the web and provides insights for practitioners aiming to
deploy secure, compliant tokenization platforms.

### [250] [AI-Hybrid TRNG: Kernel-Based Deep Learning for Near-Uniform Entropy Harvesting from Physical Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00145)
*Hasan Yiğit*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: AI-Hybrid TRNG是一个深度学习框架，直接从物理噪声中提取接近均匀的熵，无需量子设备或昂贵的射频接收器。它通过低成本射频前端和CPU时序抖动生成高熵32位流，并通过NIST SP 800-22测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统随机数生成器依赖专用硬件，成本高且体积大。AI-Hybrid TRNG旨在通过深度学习框架，利用低成本硬件实现高质量的随机数生成。

Method: 采用动态内外网络结构，结合自适应自然源和重新播种技术，生成不可预测的随机序列。无需量化步骤，直接输出高熵流。

Result: 生成的随机数通过NIST SP 800-22测试和19项定制统计测试，满足加密标准。模型体积小（<0.5 MB），适用于资源受限平台。

Conclusion: AI-Hybrid TRNG通过脱离专用硬件限制，扩展了高质量随机数生成器的应用范围，适用于安全系统、加密协议、嵌入式设备等领域。

Abstract: AI-Hybrid TRNG is a deep-learning framework that extracts near-uniform
entropy directly from physical noise, eliminating the need for bulky quantum
devices or expensive laboratory-grade RF receivers. Instead, it relies on a
low-cost, thumb-sized RF front end, plus CPU-timing jitter, for training, and
then emits 32-bit high-entropy streams without any quantization step.
  Unlike deterministic or trained artificial intelligence random number
generators (RNGs), our dynamic inner-outer network couples adaptive natural
sources and reseeding, yielding truly unpredictable and autonomous sequences.
Generated numbers pass the NIST SP 800-22 battery better than a CPU-based
method. It also passes nineteen bespoke statistical tests for both bit- and
integer-level analysis. All results satisfy cryptographic standards, while
forward and backward prediction experiments reveal no exploitable biases. The
model's footprint is below 0.5 MB, making it deployable on MCUs and FPGA soft
cores, as well as suitable for other resource-constrained platforms.
  By detaching randomness quality from dedicated hardware, AI-Hybrid TRNG
broadens the reach of high-integrity random number generators across secure
systems, cryptographic protocols, embedded and edge devices, stochastic
simulations, and server applications that need randomness.

Result: 证明了SPV协议在部分连接、敌对中继网络和传播延迟下的活性和安全性，并提出了低带宽优化方案。

Conclusion: 本文为安全的SPV实现提供了蓝图，并反驳了关于非验证客户端的常见误解。

Abstract: This paper presents a complete formal specification, protocol description,
and mathematical proof structure for Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) as
originally defined in the Bitcoin whitepaper \cite{nakamoto2008}. In stark
contrast to the misrepresentations proliferated by popular implementations, we
show that SPV is not only secure under bounded adversarial assumptions but
strictly optimal for digital cash systems requiring scalable and verifiable
transaction inclusion. We reconstruct the SPV protocol from first principles,
grounding its verification model in symbolic automata, Merkle membership
relations, and chain-of-proof dominance predicates. Through rigorous
probabilistic and game-theoretic analysis, we derive the economic bounds within
which the protocol operates securely and verify its liveness and safety
properties under partial connectivity, hostile relay networks, and adversarial
propagation delay. Our specification further introduces low-bandwidth
optimisations such as adaptive polling and compressed header synchronisation
while preserving correctness. This document serves both as a blueprint for
secure SPV implementation and a rebuttal of common misconceptions surrounding
non-validating clients.

*Yinghao Wu,Liyan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: BadViM是一种针对Vision Mamba（ViM）的新型后门攻击框架，利用共振频率触发器和隐藏状态对齐损失，成功实现高攻击成功率，同时对常见防御措施表现出强韧性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究ViM架构的安全性，尤其是其对后门攻击的脆弱性，填补该领域的空白。

Method: 提出BadViM框架，结合共振频率触发器（RFT）和隐藏状态对齐损失，设计隐蔽且分布式的触发器。

Result: 实验显示BadViM攻击成功率高，且能保持干净数据的准确性，同时对PatchDrop等防御措施具有强韧性。

Conclusion: ViM架构对后门攻击存在显著脆弱性，BadViM框架为未来防御研究提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Vision State Space Models (SSMs), particularly architectures like Vision
Mamba (ViM), have emerged as promising alternatives to Vision Transformers
(ViTs). However, the security implications of this novel architecture,
especially their vulnerability to backdoor attacks, remain critically
underexplored. Backdoor attacks aim to embed hidden triggers into victim
models, causing the model to misclassify inputs containing these triggers while
maintaining normal behavior on clean inputs. This paper investigates the
susceptibility of ViM to backdoor attacks by introducing BadViM, a novel
backdoor attack framework specifically designed for Vision Mamba. The proposed
BadViM leverages a Resonant Frequency Trigger (RFT) that exploits the frequency
sensitivity patterns of the victim model to create stealthy, distributed
triggers. To maximize attack efficacy, we propose a Hidden State Alignment loss
that strategically manipulates the internal representations of model by
aligning the hidden states of backdoor images with those of target classes.
Extensive experimental results demonstrate that BadViM achieves superior attack
success rates while maintaining clean data accuracy. Meanwhile, BadViM exhibits
remarkable resilience against common defensive measures, including PatchDrop,
PatchShuffle and JPEG compression, which typically neutralize normal backdoor
attacks.

Abstract: In a world where deepfakes and cloned voices are emerging as sophisticated
attack vectors, organizations require a new security mindset: Sensorial Zero
Trust [9]. This article presents a scientific analysis of the need to
systematically doubt information perceived through the senses, establishing
rigorous verification protocols to mitigate the risks of fraud based on
generative artificial intelligence. Key concepts, such as Out-of-Band
verification, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as forensic collaborators,
cryptographic provenance, and human training, are integrated into a framework
that extends Zero Trust principles to human sensory information. The approach
is grounded in empirical findings and academic research, emphasizing that in an
era of AI-generated realities, even our eyes and ears can no longer be
implicitly trusted without verification. Leaders are called to foster a culture
of methodological skepticism to protect organizational integrity in this new
threat landscape.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于物理感知的风格迁移方法，用于解决内联全息成像中的逆问题，无需高质量的真实数据集即可重建物体的复振幅。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习方法需要高质量的真实数据集，而实际应用中这类数据难以获取。本文旨在通过物理线索实现自适应学习。

Method: 利用物体到传感器的距离作为衍射图案中的隐式风格，通过风格域构建循环图像翻译，仅需强度测量数据集即可学习逆映射操作。

Result: 方法成功重建了动态流动的红细胞形态，展示了其在实时、无标记成像中的潜力。

Conclusion: 该方法为难以获取真实数据的成像应用提供了一种实用的学习策略。

Abstract: Inline holographic imaging presents an ill-posed inverse problem of
reconstructing objects' complex amplitude from recorded diffraction patterns.
Although recent deep learning approaches have shown promise over classical
phase retrieval algorithms, they often require high-quality ground truth
datasets of complex amplitude maps to achieve a statistical inverse mapping
operation between the two domains. Here, we present a physics-aware style
transfer approach that interprets the object-to-sensor distance as an implicit
style within diffraction patterns. Using the style domain as the intermediate
domain to construct cyclic image translation, we show that the inverse mapping
operation can be learned in an adaptive manner only with datasets composed of
intensity measurements. We further demonstrate its biomedical applicability by
reconstructing the morphology of dynamically flowing red blood cells,
highlighting its potential for real-time, label-free imaging. As a framework
that leverages physical cues inherently embedded in measurements, the presented
method offers a practical learning strategy for imaging applications where
ground truth is difficult or impossible to obtain.

Result: 提出两种组织策略：内部治理重构和外部行动者网络参与，以促进负责任的AI采纳。

Conclusion: 问责是网络化组合的关系性和涌现属性，需通过多理论整合实现全球接受的AI应用。

Abstract: This study explores how AI-powered digital innovations are reshaping
organisational accountability in a transnational governance context. As AI
systems increasingly mediate decision-making in domains such as auditing and
financial reporting, traditional mechanisms of accountability, based on
control, transparency, and auditability, are being destabilised. We integrate
the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), Actor-Network Theory (ANT), and
institutional theory to examine how organisations adopt AI technologies in
response to regulatory, ethical, and cultural pressures that transcend national
boundaries. We argue that accountability is co-constructed within global
socio-technical networks, shaped not only by user perceptions but also by
governance logics and normative expectations. Extending TAM, we incorporate
compliance and legitimacy as key factors in perceived usefulness and usability.
Drawing on ANT, we reconceptualise accountability as a relational and emergent
property of networked assemblages. We propose two organisational strategies
including internal governance reconfiguration and external actor-network
engagement to foster responsible, legitimate, and globally accepted AI adoption
in the accounting domain.

cardiovascular diseases, aiding physicians in improving diagnostic and
therapeutic quality. A novel tracking framework based on a Siamese network with
dual attention mechanisms combines self- and cross-attention strategies for
robust guidewire tip tracking. This design handles visual ambiguities, tissue

localization error of 0.421 $\pm$ 0.138 mm, with a maximum error of 1.736 mm,
and a mean Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.782. The framework maintains an
average processing speed of 57.2 frames per second, meeting the temporal
demands of endovascular imaging. Further validations with robotic platforms for

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学领域数据获取困难且隐私要求严格，阻碍机器学习应用。

Method: Med-LSDM在3D域操作，利用去标识语义图和扩散模型生成合成数据。

Result: 模型在3D-FID和Dice分数上表现优异，接近真实数据。

Conclusion: 合成数据与真实数据差距小，适用于数据增强。

Abstract: In the medical domain, acquiring large datasets is challenging due to both
accessibility issues and stringent privacy regulations. Consequently, data
availability and privacy protection are major obstacles to applying machine
learning in medical imaging. To address this, our study proposes the Med-LSDM
(Latent Semantic Diffusion Model), which operates directly in the 3D domain and
leverages de-identified semantic maps to generate synthetic data as a method of
privacy preservation and data augmentation. Unlike many existing methods that
focus on generating 2D slices, Med-LSDM is designed specifically for 3D
semantic image synthesis, making it well-suited for applications requiring full
volumetric data. Med-LSDM incorporates a guiding mechanism that controls the 3D
image generation process by applying a diffusion model within the latent space
of a pre-trained VQ-GAN. By operating in the compressed latent space, the model
significantly reduces computational complexity while still preserving critical
3D spatial details. Our approach demonstrates strong performance in 3D semantic
medical image synthesis, achieving a 3D-FID score of 0.0054 on the conditional
Duke Breast dataset and similar Dice scores (0.70964) to those of real images
(0.71496). These results demonstrate that the synthetic data from our model
have a small domain gap with real data and are useful for data augmentation.

Abstract: Accurate fetal birth weight (FBW) estimation is essential for optimizing
delivery decisions and reducing perinatal mortality. However, clinical methods
for FBW estimation are inefficient, operator-dependent, and challenging to
apply in cases of complex fetal anatomy. Existing deep learning methods are
based on 2D standard ultrasound (US) images or videos that lack spatial
information, limiting their prediction accuracy. In this study, we propose the
first method for directly estimating FBW from 3D fetal US volumes. Our approach
integrates a multi-scale feature fusion network (MFFN) and a synthetic
sample-based learning framework (SSLF). The MFFN effectively extracts and fuses
multi-scale features under sparse supervision by incorporating channel
attention, spatial attention, and a ranking-based loss function. SSLF generates
synthetic samples by simply combining fetal head and abdomen data from
different fetuses, utilizing semi-supervised learning to improve prediction
performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior
performance, with a mean absolute error of $166.4\pm155.9$ $g$ and a mean
absolute percentage error of $5.1\pm4.6$%, outperforming existing methods and
approaching the accuracy of a senior doctor. Code is available at:

Abstract: In this paper, we present the VMSE U-Net and VM-Unet CBAM+ model, two
cutting-edge deep learning architectures designed to enhance medical image
segmentation. Our approach integrates Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) and
Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) techniques into the traditional VM
U-Net framework, significantly improving segmentation accuracy, feature
localization, and computational efficiency. Both models show superior
performance compared to the baseline VM-Unet across multiple datasets. Notably,
VMSEUnet achieves the highest accuracy, IoU, precision, and recall while
maintaining low loss values. It also exhibits exceptional computational
efficiency with faster inference times and lower memory usage on both GPU and

valuable tool for medical image analysis. These findings highlight its
potential for real-world clinical applications, emphasizing the importance of

Motivation: 传统迭代方法和学习型展开方法在医学图像配准中存在收敛性不足和内存消耗大的问题。

Method: 采用深度平衡模型（DEQ），将配准问题转化为平衡寻找问题，保持恒定内存使用。

Result: 在脑MRI和肺CT数据集上表现优异，内存消耗显著降低，且收敛稳定。

Conclusion: DEQReg通过平衡机制，弥合了传统优化方法与现代学习型方法之间的差距。

Abstract: Deformable medical image registration is traditionally formulated as an
optimization problem. While classical methods solve this problem iteratively,
recent learning-based approaches use recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to mimic
this process by unrolling the prediction of deformation fields in a fixed
number of steps. However, classical methods typically converge after sufficient
iterations, but learning-based unrolling methods lack a theoretical convergence
guarantee and show instability empirically. In addition, unrolling methods have
a practical bottleneck at training time: GPU memory usage grows linearly with
the unrolling steps due to backpropagation through time (BPTT). To address both
theoretical and practical challenges, we propose DEQReg, a novel registration
framework based on Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQ), which formulates registration
as an equilibrium-seeking problem, establishing a natural connection between
classical optimization and learning-based unrolling methods. DEQReg maintains
constant memory usage, enabling theoretically unlimited iteration steps.
Through extensive evaluation on the public brain MRI and lung CT datasets, we
show that DEQReg can achieve competitive registration performance, while
substantially reducing memory consumption compared to state-of-the-art
unrolling methods. We also reveal an intriguing phenomenon: the performance of
existing unrolling methods first increases slightly then degrades irreversibly
when the inference steps go beyond the training configuration. In contrast,
DEQReg achieves stable convergence with its inbuilt equilibrium-seeking
mechanism, bridging the gap between classical optimization-based and modern
learning-based registration methods.

Conclusion: MTCNet通过运动-拓扑引导策略，显著提升了4D二尖瓣分割的准确性和一致性。

Abstract: Mitral regurgitation is one of the most prevalent cardiac disorders.
Four-dimensional (4D) ultrasound has emerged as the primary imaging modality
for assessing dynamic valvular morphology. However, 4D mitral valve (MV)
analysis remains challenging due to limited phase annotations, severe motion
artifacts, and poor imaging quality. Yet, the absence of inter-phase dependency
in existing methods hinders 4D MV analysis. To bridge this gap, we propose a
Motion-Topology guided consistency network (MTCNet) for accurate 4D MV
ultrasound segmentation in semi-supervised learning (SSL). MTCNet requires only
sparse end-diastolic and end-systolic annotations. First, we design a
cross-phase motion-guided consistency learning strategy, utilizing a
bi-directional attention memory bank to propagate spatio-temporal features.
This enables MTCNet to achieve excellent performance both per- and inter-phase.
Second, we devise a novel topology-guided correlation regularization that
explores physical prior knowledge to maintain anatomically plausible.
Therefore, MTCNet can effectively leverage structural correspondence between
labeled and unlabeled phases. Extensive evaluations on the first largest 4D MV
dataset, with 1408 phases from 160 patients, show that MTCNet performs superior
cross-phase consistency compared to other advanced methods (Dice: 87.30%, HD:
1.75mm). Both the code and the dataset are available at

Motivation: 现有MRI重建技术在高加速因子下可能遗漏临床相关的小且罕见病理信息，导致假阴性诊断。

Method: 提出SDR方法，通过生成语义多样性增强的重建图像，确保所有重建与测量数据一致。使用fastMRI+数据集训练目标检测器进行自动评估。

Result: SDR显著降低了假阴性诊断的概率（召回率提高），并提升了平均精度。

Conclusion: SDR方法在保留临床相关信息方面优于现有技术，代码已开源。

Abstract: In recent years, accelerated MRI reconstruction based on deep learning has
led to significant improvements in image quality with impressive results for
high acceleration factors. However, from a clinical perspective image quality
is only secondary; much more important is that all clinically relevant
information is preserved in the reconstruction from heavily undersampled data.
In this paper, we show that existing techniques, even when considering
resampling for diffusion-based reconstruction, can fail to reconstruct small
and rare pathologies, thus leading to potentially wrong diagnosis decisions
(false negatives). To uncover the potentially missing clinical information we
propose ``Semantically Diverse Reconstructions'' (\SDR), a method which, given
an original reconstruction, generates novel reconstructions with enhanced
semantic variability while all of them are fully consistent with the measured
data. To evaluate \SDR automatically we train an object detector on the
fastMRI+ dataset. We show that \SDR significantly reduces the chance of
false-negative diagnoses (higher recall) and improves mean average precision
compared to the original reconstructions. The code is available on

Abstract: Image segmentation plays a vital role in the medical field by isolating
organs or regions of interest from surrounding areas. Traditionally,
segmentation models are trained on a specific organ or a disease, limiting
their ability to handle other organs and diseases. At present, few advanced
models can perform multi-organ or multi-disease segmentation, offering greater
flexibility. Also, recently, prompt-based image segmentation has gained
attention as a more flexible approach. It allows models to segment areas based
on user-provided prompts. Despite these advances, there has been no dedicated
work on prompt-based interactive multi-organ and multi-disease segmentation,
especially for Chest X-rays. This work presents two main contributions: first,
generating doodle prompts by medical experts of a collection of datasets from
multiple sources with 23 classes, including 6 organs and 17 diseases,
specifically designed for prompt-based Chest X-ray segmentation. Second, we
introduce Prompt2SegCXR, a lightweight model for accurately segmenting multiple
organs and diseases from Chest X-rays. The model incorporates multi-stage
feature fusion, enabling it to combine features from various network layers for
better spatial and semantic understanding, enhancing segmentation accuracy.
Compared to existing pre-trained models for prompt-based image segmentation,
our model scores well, providing a reliable solution for segmenting Chest
X-rays based on user prompts.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于物理约束的深度学习框架，用于加速心脏T1映射，减少扫描时间并提高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MOLLI方法扫描时间长且易受呼吸运动影响，现有深度学习方法忽视物理约束，限制了泛化能力。

Method: 利用物理信息神经ODE建模时间动态，开发连续时间LSTM-ODE模型，支持稀疏数据采集。

Result: 实验显示该方法在原生和对比后序列中均表现优越，物理约束显著优于纯数据驱动方法。

Conclusion: 该框架成功结合物理约束与深度学习，为T1映射提供了高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Spin-lattice relaxation time ($T_1$) is an important biomarker in cardiac
parametric mapping for characterizing myocardial tissue and diagnosing
cardiomyopathies. Conventional Modified Look-Locker Inversion Recovery (MOLLI)
acquires 11 breath-hold baseline images with interleaved rest periods to ensure
mapping accuracy. However, prolonged scanning can be challenging for patients
with poor breathholds, often leading to motion artifacts that degrade image
quality. In addition, $T_1$ mapping requires voxel-wise nonlinear fitting to a
signal recovery model involving an iterative estimation process. Recent studies
have proposed deep-learning approaches for rapid $T_1$ mapping using shortened
sequences to reduce acquisition time for patient comfort. Nevertheless,
existing methods overlook important physics constraints, limiting
interpretability and generalization. In this work, we present an accelerated,
end-to-end $T_1$ mapping framework leveraging Physics-Informed Neural Ordinary
Differential Equations (ODEs) to model temporal dynamics and address these
challenges. Our method achieves high-accuracy $T_1$ estimation from a sparse
subset of baseline images and ensures efficient null index estimation at test
time. Specifically, we develop a continuous-time LSTM-ODE model to enable
selective Look-Locker (LL) data acquisition with arbitrary time lags.
Experimental results show superior performance in $T_1$ estimation for both
native and post-contrast sequences and demonstrate the strong benefit of our
physics-based formulation over direct data-driven $T_1$ priors.

Motivation: 提高术后OCT扫描中对不同类型ERM手术的分类准确性，辅助临床决策。

Method: 采用ResNet18 CNN架构，结合能量裁剪和小波去噪预处理，并引入可调小波单元（OrthLatt-UwU和PR-Relax-UwU）优化模型。

Result: 预处理后输入准确率达72%，可调小波单元进一步提升至76%和78%，优于人类评分者的50%。

Conclusion: CNN模型结合可调小波单元在ERM手术分类中表现出潜力，为临床提供更可靠的分类结果。

Abstract: In this study, we developed deep learning-based method to classify the type
of surgery performed for epiretinal membrane (ERM) removal, either internal
limiting membrane (ILM) removal or ERM-alone removal. Our model, based on the
ResNet18 convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, utilizes
postoperative optical coherence tomography (OCT) center scans as inputs. We
evaluated the model using both original scans and scans preprocessed with
energy crop and wavelet denoising, achieving 72% accuracy on preprocessed
inputs, outperforming the 66% accuracy achieved on original scans. To further
improve accuracy, we integrated tunable wavelet units with two key adaptations:
Orthogonal Lattice-based Wavelet Units (OrthLatt-UwU) and Perfect
Reconstruction Relaxation-based Wavelet Units (PR-Relax-UwU). These units
allowed the model to automatically adjust filter coefficients during training
and were incorporated into downsampling, stride-two convolution, and pooling
layers, enhancing its ability to distinguish between ERM-ILM removal and
ERM-alone removal, with OrthLattUwU boosting accuracy to 76% and PR-Relax-UwU
increasing performance to 78%. Performance comparisons showed that our AI model
outperformed a trained human grader, who achieved only 50% accuracy in
classifying the removal surgery types from postoperative OCT scans. These
findings highlight the potential of CNN based models to improve clinical
decision-making by providing more accurate and reliable classifications. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first work to employ tunable wavelets for
classifying different types of ERM removal surgery.

Abstract: Early detection and diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy is one of the current
research focuses in ophthalmology. However, due to the subtle features of
micro-lesions and their susceptibility to background interference, ex-isting
detection methods still face many challenges in terms of accuracy and
robustness. To address these issues, a lightweight and high-precision detection
model based on the improved YOLOv8n, named YOLO-KFG, is proposed. Firstly, a
new dynamic convolution KWConv and C2f-KW module are designed to improve the
backbone network, enhancing the model's ability to perceive micro-lesions.
Secondly, a fea-ture-focused diffusion pyramid network FDPN is designed to
fully integrate multi-scale context information, further improving the model's
ability to perceive micro-lesions. Finally, a lightweight shared detection head
GSDHead is designed to reduce the model's parameter count, making it more
deployable on re-source-constrained devices. Experimental results show that
compared with the base model YOLOv8n, the improved model reduces the parameter
count by 20.7%, increases mAP@0.5 by 4.1%, and improves the recall rate by
7.9%. Compared with single-stage mainstream algorithms such as YOLOv5n and
YOLOv10n, YOLO-KFG demonstrates significant advantages in both detection
accuracy and efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管深度学习模型在颅内动脉瘤检测上有所改进，但高假阳性率仍是临床应用的障碍。研究旨在通过解剖学后处理进一步减少假阳性。

Method: 使用两种深度学习模型（CPM-Net和3D-CNN-TR）训练开源CTA数据，并应用基于解剖学的后处理（如脑、动脉、静脉分割掩码）去除假阳性。

Result: 后处理方法显著降低了假阳性率（CPM-Net降低70.6%，3D-CNN-TR降低51.6%），且未减少真阳性。

Conclusion: 基于解剖学的后处理可提升深度学习模型的性能，为动脉瘤检测的临床应用提供了潜力。

Abstract: Introduction: Deep learning (DL) models can help detect intracranial
aneurysms on CTA, but high false positive (FP) rates remain a barrier to
clinical translation, despite improvement in model architectures and strategies
like detection threshold tuning. We employed an automated, anatomy-based,
heuristic-learning hybrid artery-vein segmentation post-processing method to
further reduce FPs. Methods: Two DL models, CPM-Net and a deformable 3D
convolutional neural network-transformer hybrid (3D-CNN-TR), were trained with
1,186 open-source CTAs (1,373 annotated aneurysms), and evaluated with 143
held-out private CTAs (218 annotated aneurysms). Brain, artery, vein, and
cavernous venous sinus (CVS) segmentation masks were applied to remove possible
FPs in the DL outputs that overlapped with: (1) brain mask; (2) vein mask; (3)
vein more than artery masks; (4) brain plus vein mask; (5) brain plus vein more
than artery masks. Results: CPM-Net yielded 139 true-positives (TP); 79
false-negative (FN); 126 FP. 3D-CNN-TR yielded 179 TP; 39 FN; 182 FP. FPs were
commonly extracranial (CPM-Net 27.3%; 3D-CNN-TR 42.3%), venous (CPM-Net 56.3%;
3D-CNN-TR 29.1%), arterial (CPM-Net 11.9%; 3D-CNN-TR 53.3%), and non-vascular
(CPM-Net 25.4%; 3D-CNN-TR 9.3%) structures. Method 5 performed best, reducing
CPM-Net FP by 70.6% (89/126) and 3D-CNN-TR FP by 51.6% (94/182), without
reducing TP, lowering the FP/case rate from 0.88 to 0.26 for CPM-NET, and from
1.27 to 0.62 for the 3D-CNN-TR. Conclusion: Anatomy-based, interpretable
post-processing can improve DL-based aneurysm detection model performance. More
broadly, automated, domain-informed, hybrid heuristic-learning processing holds
promise for improving the performance and clinical acceptance of aneurysm
detection models.

Abstract: Objectives Parametric tissue mapping enables quantitative cardiac tissue
characterization but is limited by inter-observer variability during manual
delineation. Traditional approaches relying on average relaxation values and
single cutoffs may oversimplify myocardial complexity. This study evaluates
whether deep learning (DL) can achieve segmentation accuracy comparable to
inter-observer variability, explores the utility of statistical features beyond
mean T1/T2 values, and assesses whether machine learning (ML) combining
multiple features enhances disease detection. Materials & Methods T1 and T2
maps were manually segmented. The test subset was independently annotated by
two observers, and inter-observer variability was assessed. A DL model was
trained to segment left ventricle blood pool and myocardium. Average (A), lower
quartile (LQ), median (M), and upper quartile (UQ) were computed for the
myocardial pixels and employed in classification by applying cutoffs or in ML.
Dice similarity coefficient (DICE) and mean absolute percentage error evaluated
segmentation performance. Bland-Altman plots assessed inter-user and
model-observer agreement. Receiver operating characteristic analysis determined
optimal cutoffs. Pearson correlation compared features from model and manual
segmentations. F1-score, precision, and recall evaluated classification
performance. Wilcoxon test assessed differences between classification methods,
with p < 0.05 considered statistically significant. Results 144 subjects were
split into training (100), validation (15) and evaluation (29) subsets.
Segmentation model achieved a DICE of 85.4%, surpassing inter-observer
agreement. Random forest applied to all features increased F1-score (92.7%, p <
0.001). Conclusion DL facilitates segmentation of T1/ T2 maps. Combining
multiple features with ML improves disease detection.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of brain tumors in MRI scans is essential for reliable
clinical diagnosis and effective treatment planning. Recently, diffusion models
have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in image generation and segmentation
tasks. This paper introduces a novel approach to corrective segmentation based
on diffusion models. We propose DMCIE (Diffusion Model with Concatenation of
Inputs and Errors), a novel framework for accurate brain tumor segmentation in
multi-modal MRI scans. We employ a 3D U-Net to generate an initial segmentation
mask, from which an error map is generated by identifying the differences
between the prediction and the ground truth. The error map, concatenated with
the original MRI images, are used to guide a diffusion model. Using multimodal
MRI inputs (T1, T1ce, T2, FLAIR), DMCIE effectively enhances segmentation
accuracy by focusing on misclassified regions, guided by the original inputs.
Evaluated on the BraTS2020 dataset, DMCIE outperforms several state-of-the-art
diffusion-based segmentation methods, achieving a Dice Score of 93.46 and an
HD95 of 5.94 mm. These results highlight the effectiveness of error-guided
diffusion in producing precise and reliable brain tumor segmentations.

Motivation: 解决地下分析任务分散、模型专用的问题，提出统一框架。

Method: 两阶段训练：自监督表示学习与对抗微调，结合提示条件推理。

Result: GEM在多种任务中表现优异，如火星雷达地层分析、地震解释等。

Conclusion: GEM为可扩展、人机交互的地球物理AI奠定了基础。

Abstract: Understanding Earth's subsurface is critical for energy transition, natural
hazard mitigation, and planetary science. Yet subsurface analysis remains
fragmented, with separate models required for structural interpretation,
stratigraphic analysis, geobody segmentation, and property modeling-each
tightly coupled to specific data distributions and task formulations. We
introduce the Geological Everything Model 3D (GEM), a unified generative
architecture that reformulates all these tasks as prompt-conditioned inference
along latent structural frameworks derived from subsurface imaging. This
formulation moves beyond task-specific models by enabling a shared inference
mechanism, where GEM propagates human-provided prompts-such as well logs,
masks, or structural sketches-along inferred structural frameworks to produce
geologically coherent outputs. Through this mechanism, GEM achieves zero-shot
generalization across tasks with heterogeneous prompt types, without retraining
for new tasks or data sources. This capability emerges from a two-stage
training process that combines self-supervised representation learning on
large-scale field seismic data with adversarial fine-tuning using mixed prompts
and labels across diverse subsurface tasks. GEM demonstrates broad
applicability across surveys and tasks, including Martian radar stratigraphy
analysis, structural interpretation in subduction zones, full seismic
stratigraphic interpretation, geobody delineation, and property modeling. By
bridging expert knowledge with generative reasoning in a structurally aware
manner, GEM lays the foundation for scalable, human-in-the-loop geophysical
AI-transitioning from fragmented pipelines to a vertically integrated,
promptable reasoning system. Project page: https://douyimin.github.io/GEM

Motivation: 现有方法主要优化工具表示，忽视了精确查询理解的重要性，MassTool旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用两塔架构（工具使用检测塔和工具检索塔），结合QC-GCN、SUIM和AdaKT模块，多任务联合优化。

Result: 实验证明MassTool显著提高了检索准确性。

Conclusion: MassTool通过精确查询理解和多任务学习，为工具检索提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Tool retrieval is a critical component in enabling large language models
(LLMs) to interact effectively with external tools. It aims to precisely filter
the massive tools into a small set of candidates for the downstream
tool-augmented LLMs. However, most existing approaches primarily focus on
optimizing tool representations, often neglecting the importance of precise
query comprehension. To address this gap, we introduce MassTool, a multi-task
search-based framework designed to enhance both query representation and tool
retrieval accuracy. MassTool employs a two-tower architecture: a tool usage
detection tower that predicts the need for function calls, and a tool retrieval
tower that leverages a query-centric graph convolution network (QC-GCN) for
effective query-tool matching. It also incorporates search-based user intent
modeling (SUIM) to handle diverse and out-of-distribution queries, alongside an
adaptive knowledge transfer (AdaKT) module for efficient multi-task learning.
By jointly optimizing tool usage detection loss, list-wise retrieval loss, and
contrastive regularization loss, MassTool establishes a robust dual-step
sequential decision-making pipeline for precise query understanding. Extensive
experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in improving retrieval accuracy. Our
code is available at https://github.com/wxydada/MassTool.

Result: 提出未来研究方向，即通过AI代理在聊天中辅助群体决策，以实现更自然的决策环境。

Conclusion: 呼吁重新定位群体推荐系统研究，利用AI技术提升实用性，推动其在实际中的广泛应用。

Abstract: More than twenty-five years ago, first ideas were developed on how to design
a system that can provide recommendations to groups of users instead of
individual users. Since then, a rich variety of algorithmic proposals were
published, e.g., on how to acquire individual preferences, how to aggregate
them, and how to generate recommendations for groups of users. However, despite
the rich literature on the topic, barely any examples of real-world group
recommender systems can be found. This lets us question common assumptions in
academic research, in particular regarding communication processes in a group
and how recommendation-supported decisions are made. In this essay, we argue
that these common assumptions and corresponding system designs often may not
match the needs or expectations of users. We thus call for a reorientation in
this research area, leveraging the capabilities of modern Generative AI
assistants like ChatGPT. Specifically, as one promising future direction, we
envision group recommender systems to be systems where human group members
interact in a chat and an AI-based group recommendation agent assists the
decision-making process in an agentic way. Ultimately, this shall lead to a
more natural group decision-making environment and finally to wider adoption of
group recommendation systems in practice.

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has enabled the development
of autonomous web agents capable of navigating and interacting with real

instability and inconsistency of existing benchmarks, which often rely on
dynamic content or oversimplified simulations. In this work, we introduce
WebArXiv, a static and time-invariant benchmark comprising 275 web-based tasks
grounded in the arXiv platform. WebArXiv ensures reproducible and reliable
evaluation by anchoring tasks in fixed web snapshots with deterministic ground
truths and standardized action trajectories. Through behavioral analysis, we
identify a common failure mode, Rigid History Reflection, where agents
over-rely on fixed interaction histories. To address this, we propose a
lightweight dynamic reflection mechanism that allows agents to selectively
retrieve relevant past steps during decision-making. We evaluate ten
state-of-the-art web agents on WebArXiv. Results demonstrate clear performance
differences across agents and validate the effectiveness of our proposed
reflection strategy.

Abstract: Modern firms face a flood of dense, unstructured reports. Turning these
documents into usable insights takes heavy effort and is far from agile when
quick answers are needed. VTS-AI tackles this gap. It integrates Visual
Thinking Strategies, which emphasize evidence-based observation, linking, and
thinking, into AI agents, so the agents can extract business insights from
unstructured text, tables, and images at scale. The system works in three tiers
(micro, meso, macro). It tags issues, links them to source pages, and rolls
them into clear action levers stored in a searchable YAML file. In tests on an
18-page business report, VTS-AI matched the speed of a one-shot ChatGPT prompt
yet produced richer findings: page locations, verbatim excerpts, severity
scores, and causal links. Analysts can accept or adjust these outputs in the
same IDE, keeping human judgment in the loop. Early results show VTS-AI spots
the direction of key metrics and flags where deeper number-crunching is needed.
Next steps include mapping narrative tags to financial ratios, adding
finance-tuned language models through a Model-Context Protocol, and building a
Risk & Safety Layer to stress-test models and secure data. These upgrades aim
to make VTS-AI a production-ready, audit-friendly tool for rapid business

Motivation: 随着半导体技术节点的进步，传统SVRF开发方法因设计规则复杂化而失效，亟需一种新方法填补专业知识缺口。

Method: 采用AST嵌入和RAG技术，结合领域知识进行代码生成，并通过结构验证确保语义准确性。

Result: 在740条DRC规则测试中，代码生成准确性提升了40%。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅优化了SVRF开发效率，还减少了人工纠错，显著提升了生产力。

Abstract: Standard Verification Rule Format (SVRF) is essential for semiconductor
applications like Design Rule Check (DRC), Layout Versus Schematic (LVS), and
Optical Proximity Correction (OPC) and it faces challenges as advancing nodes
create complex design rules that renders traditional SVRF development
ineffective and highlight an expertise gap. This paper introduces a novel
methodology integrating Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) embedding and
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for enhanced SVRF code synthesis, ensuring
semantic accuracy and error minimization through structural validation with
domain-specific insights for precise code generation.
  We evaluate different T5-based models and propose an innovative SVRF-specific
scoring framework that complements standard metrics like BLEU and ROUGE-L. In
our approach, AST provides rigorous structural validation, while RAG infuses
relevant domain knowledge, effectively enhancing the code generation workflow.
  Testing on a comprehensive benchmark of 740 DRC rule implementations, our
methodology demonstrates up to a 40\% improvement in code generation accuracy
compared to basic text-based fine-tuning process. This fusion of industry
expertise with advanced coding strategies not only optimizes SVRF development
under limited dataset constraints but also creates a more intuitive and
efficient coding environment. Consequently, users can rapidly iterate through
design cycles, reduce manual error correction, and significantly improve
overall productivity.

TL;DR: iPanda是一个利用大语言模型（LLMs）自动化协议一致性测试的端到端框架，显著提高了测试代码生成的效率和成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统协议一致性测试方法依赖人工创建测试用例和脚本，效率低下且劳动密集。LLMs的文本理解和代码生成能力为自动化提供了新机会。

Method: iPanda结合关键词生成测试用例和基于检索增强的代码生成方法，并通过迭代自校正机制优化生成的测试脚本。

Result: 实验表明，iPanda在测试代码生成的成功率（Pass@1）上比纯LLM方法提高了4.675至10.751倍。

Conclusion: iPanda为协议一致性测试提供了一种高效、自动化的解决方案，显著优于传统和纯LLM方法。

Abstract: Conformance testing is essential for ensuring that protocol implementations
comply with their specifications. However, traditional testing approaches
involve manually creating numerous test cases and scripts, making the process
labor-intensive and inefficient. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated impressive text comprehension and code generation abilities,
providing promising opportunities for automation. In this paper, we propose
iPanda, the first end-to-end framework that leverages LLMs to automate protocol
conformance testing. Given a protocol specification document and its
implementation, iPanda first employs a keyword-based method to automatically
generate comprehensive test cases. Then, it utilizes a code-based
retrieval-augmented generation approach to effectively interpret the
implementation and produce executable test code. To further enhance code
quality, iPanda incorporates an iterative self-correction mechanism to refine
generated test scripts interactively. Finally, by executing and analyzing the
generated tests, iPanda systematically verifies compliance between
implementations and protocol specifications. Comprehensive experiments on
various protocols show that iPanda significantly outperforms pure LLM-based
approaches, improving the success rate (Pass@1) of test-code generation by
factors ranging from 4.675 times to 10.751 times.

TL;DR: 研究探讨AI助手对代码可维护性的影响，发现AI辅助开发能提升速度和代码健康度，但未显著降低可维护性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管AI助手如GitHub Copilot和Cursor提高了开发效率，但其对代码可维护性的影响尚不明确，需进一步研究。

Method: 通过两阶段实验，151名参与者（95%为专业开发者）分别在有/无AI辅助下开发功能，随后由其他参与者维护代码。

Result: AI辅助开发显著提升开发速度（中位减少30.7%时间），但对可维护性影响有限，仅习惯性用户代码健康度显著提升。

Conclusion: AI助手能有效加速开发且未损害可维护性，未来需关注代码膨胀和认知债务等潜在风险。

Abstract: [Context] AI assistants, like GitHub Copilot and Cursor, are transforming
software engineering. While several studies highlight productivity
improvements, their impact on maintainability requires further investigation.
[Objective] This study investigates whether co-development with AI assistants
affects software maintainability, specifically how easily other developers can
evolve the resulting source code. [Method] We conducted a two-phase controlled
experiment involving 151 participants, 95% of whom were professional
developers. In Phase 1, participants added a new feature to a Java web
application, with or without AI assistance. In Phase 2, a randomized controlled
trial, new participants evolved these solutions without AI assistance.
[Results] AI-assisted development in Phase 1 led to a modest speedup in
subsequent evolution and slightly higher average CodeHealth. Although neither
difference was significant overall, the increase in CodeHealth was
statistically significant when habitual AI users completed Phase 1. For Phase
1, we also observed a significant effect that corroborates previous
productivity findings: using an AI assistant yielded a 30.7% median decrease in
task completion time. Moreover, for habitual AI users, the mean speedup was
55.9%. [Conclusions] Our study adds to the growing evidence that AI assistants
can effectively accelerate development. Moreover, we did not observe warning
signs of degraded code-level maintainability. We recommend that future research
focus on risks such as code bloat from excessive code generation and the
build-up of cognitive debt as developers invest less mental effort during
implementation.

TL;DR: 提出一种通过抵押索赔和递归验证游戏确保AI代理正确性的协议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在动态、低信任环境中，无法通过预先规范或集中监督确保AI代理的正确性。

Method: 任务发布为意图，解决者竞争完成，验证者事后检查正确性，挑战者可抵押触发验证。

Result: 激励对齐时，正确性成为纳什均衡。

Conclusion: 该协议通过经济激励确保AI代理的正确性。

Abstract: Correctness is an emergent property of systems where exposing error is
cheaper than committing it. In dynamic, low-trust environments, autonomous AI
agents benefit from delegating work to sub-agents, yet correctness cannot be
assured through upfront specification or centralized oversight. We propose a
protocol that enforces correctness through collateralized claims in a recursive
verification game. Tasks are published as intents, and solvers compete to
fulfill them. Selected solvers carry out tasks under risk, with correctness
checked post hoc by verifiers. Any challenger can challenge a result by staking
against it to trigger the verification process. Incorrect agents are slashed
and correct opposition is rewarded, with an escalation path that penalizes
erroneous verifiers themselves. When incentives are aligned across solvers,
challengers, and verifiers, falsification conditions make correctness the Nash
equilibrium.

TL;DR: 本文研究了随机方法（如归一化流、条件流匹配和整流流）在生成语音韵律中的有效性，证明其效果优于传统确定性方法，并能模拟人类语音的变异性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成语音韵律是文本到语音合成的挑战，尤其是为了可解释性和可控性而显式建模韵律参数的系统。

Method: 比较了随机方法（归一化流、条件流匹配、整流流）与传统确定性基线及人类语音样本。

Result: 随机方法生成的韵律与人类语音相当，并能通过调节采样温度提供额外的可控性。

Conclusion: 随机方法在生成自然韵律和可控性方面表现优异，适用于语音合成任务。

Abstract: While generative methods have progressed rapidly in recent years, generating
expressive prosody for an utterance remains a challenging task in
text-to-speech synthesis. This is particularly true for systems that model
prosody explicitly through parameters such as pitch, energy, and duration,
which is commonly done for the sake of interpretability and controllability. In
this work, we investigate the effectiveness of stochastic methods for this
task, including Normalizing Flows, Conditional Flow Matching, and Rectified
Flows. We compare these methods to a traditional deterministic baseline, as
well as to real human realizations. Our extensive subjective and objective
evaluations demonstrate that stochastic methods produce natural prosody on par
with human speakers by capturing the variability inherent in human speech.
Further, they open up additional controllability options by allowing the
sampling temperature to be tuned.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种电路-算法协同设计框架，用于音频信号分类中的可学习模拟前端（AFE），通过联合优化后端分类器和AFE的传递函数实现系统级优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将AFE和后端分类器分开设计效果不理想，本文旨在通过联合优化提升性能。

Method: 采用SNR感知训练循环调整模拟带通滤波器（BPF）的传递函数参数，并使用协同设计损失函数LBPF优化滤波器组和分类器。

Result: 在SKY130 130nm CMOS工艺中实现，优化设计在5 dB至20 dB的输入信号SNR范围内，10关键词分类任务准确率达90.5%-94.2%，功耗和电容面积分别减少8.7%和12.9%。

Conclusion: 提出的协同设计方法显著优于传统方法，实现了系统级优化和资源节省。

Abstract: This paper presents a circuit-algorithm co-design framework for learnable
analog front-end (AFE) in audio signal classification. Designing AFE and
backend classifiers separately is a common practice but non-ideal, as shown in
this paper. Instead, this paper proposes a joint optimization of the backend
classifier with the AFE's transfer function to achieve system-level optimum.
More specifically, the transfer function parameters of an analog bandpass
filter (BPF) bank are tuned in a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)-aware training
loop for the classifier. Using a co-design loss function LBPF, this work shows
superior optimization of both the filter bank and the classifier. Implemented
in open-source SKY130 130nm CMOS process, the optimized design achieved
90.5%-94.2% accuracy for 10-keyword classification task across a wide range of
input signal SNR from 5 dB to 20 dB, with only 22k classifier parameters.
Compared to conventional approach, the proposed audio AFE achieves 8.7% and
12.9% reduction in power and capacitor area respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MAGs无法表示循环因果关系，限制了其应用范围。本文旨在解决这一局限性。

Method: 提出并研究了σ-MAGs，分析了其性质，并给出了其马尔可夫等价类的特征。

Result: σ-MAGs能够表示包含潜在变量和循环因果关系的图结构，扩展了传统MAGs的能力。

Conclusion: σ-MAGs为研究循环因果关系提供了新的工具，扩展了因果发现的理论基础。

Abstract: Maximal Ancestral Graphs (MAGs) provide an abstract representation of
Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) with latent (selection) variables. These
graphical objects encode information about ancestral relations and
d-separations of the DAGs they represent. This abstract representation has been
used amongst others to prove the soundness and completeness of the FCI
algorithm for causal discovery, and to derive a do-calculus for its output. One
significant inherent limitation of MAGs is that they rule out the possibility
of cyclic causal relationships. In this work, we address that limitation. We
introduce and study a class of graphical objects that we coin
''$\sigma$-Maximal Ancestral Graphs'' (''$\sigma$-MAGs''). We show how these
graphs provide an abstract representation of (possibly cyclic) Directed Graphs
(DGs) with latent (selection) variables, analogously to how MAGs represent
DAGs. We study the properties of these objects and provide a characterization
of their Markov equivalence classes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在复杂科学工作流中因内存、规划和工具集成限制而难以应用的问题。

Method: 动态构建代理，利用有限状态自动机（FSA）记忆实现状态跟踪和上下文感知决策。

Result: SciBORG在物理和虚拟硬件中验证了可靠执行、自适应规划和可解释状态转换。

Conclusion: 记忆和状态感知是代理规划和可靠性的关键，为复杂环境中的AI代理部署提供了通用基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have enabled powerful advances in natural
language understanding and generation. Yet their application to complex,
real-world scientific workflows remain limited by challenges in memory,
planning, and tool integration. Here, we introduce SciBORG (Scientific Bespoke
Artificial Intelligence Agents Optimized for Research Goals), a modular agentic
framework that allows LLM-based agents to autonomously plan, reason, and
achieve robust and reliable domain-specific task execution. Agents are
constructed dynamically from source code documentation and augmented with
finite-state automata (FSA) memory, enabling persistent state tracking and
context-aware decision-making. This approach eliminates the need for manual
prompt engineering and allows for robust, scalable deployment across diverse
applications via maintaining context across extended workflows and to recover
from tool or execution failures. We validate SciBORG through integration with
both physical and virtual hardware, such as microwave synthesizers for
executing user-specified reactions, with context-aware decision making and
demonstrate its use in autonomous multi-step bioassay retrieval from the
PubChem database utilizing multi-step planning, reasoning, agent-to-agent
communication and coordination for execution of exploratory tasks. Systematic
benchmarking shows that SciBORG agents achieve reliable execution, adaptive
planning, and interpretable state transitions. Our results show that memory and
state awareness are critical enablers of agentic planning and reliability,
offering a generalizable foundation for deploying AI agents in complex
environments.

Motivation: 现有的移动边缘AI推理策略无法处理cAI系统中DNN和Transformer的并发推理需求，因此需要一种新的调度方法。

Method: Twill框架采用任务亲和性感知的集群映射和迁移、优先级感知的任务冻结/解冻以及动态电压频率调整（DVFS）技术。

Result: 在Nvidia Jetson Orin NX平台上，Twill将推理延迟平均降低了54%，同时满足功耗预算。

Conclusion: Twill有效解决了cAI系统在移动边缘平台上的调度挑战，显著提升了性能和能效。

Abstract: Compound AI (cAI) systems chain multiple AI models to solve complex problems.
cAI systems are typically composed of deep neural networks (DNNs),
transformers, and large language models (LLMs), exhibiting a high degree of
computational diversity and dynamic workload variation. Deploying cAI services
on mobile edge platforms poses a significant challenge in scheduling concurrent
DNN-transformer inference tasks, which arrive dynamically in an unknown
sequence. Existing mobile edge AI inference strategies manage multi-DNN or
transformer-only workloads, relying on design-time profiling, and cannot handle
concurrent inference of DNNs and transformers required by cAI systems. In this
work, we address the challenge of scheduling cAI systems on heterogeneous
mobile edge platforms. We present Twill, a run-time framework to handle
concurrent inference requests of cAI workloads through task affinity-aware
cluster mapping and migration, priority-aware task freezing/unfreezing, and
DVFS, while minimizing inference latency within power budgets. We implement and
deploy our Twill framework on the Nvidia Jetson Orin NX platform. We evaluate
Twill against state-of-the-art edge AI inference techniques over contemporary
DNNs and LLMs, reducing inference latency by 54% on average, while honoring
power budgets.

Abstract: The long-standing vision of intelligent cities is to create efficient,
livable, and sustainable urban environments using big data and artificial
intelligence technologies. Recently, the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs)
has opened new ways toward realizing this vision. With powerful semantic
understanding and reasoning capabilities, LLMs can be deployed as intelligent
agents capable of autonomously solving complex problems across domains. In this
article, we focus on Urban LLM Agents, which are LLM-powered agents that are
semi-embodied within the hybrid cyber-physical-social space of cities and used
for system-level urban decision-making. First, we introduce the concept of
urban LLM agents, discussing their unique capabilities and features. Second, we
survey the current research landscape from the perspective of agent workflows,
encompassing urban sensing, memory management, reasoning, execution, and
learning. Third, we categorize the application domains of urban LLM agents into
five groups: urban planning, transportation, environment, public safety, and
urban society, presenting representative works in each group. Finally, we
discuss trustworthiness and evaluation issues that are critical for real-world
deployment, and identify several open problems for future research. This survey
aims to establish a foundation for the emerging field of urban LLM agents and
to provide a roadmap for advancing the intersection of LLMs and urban
intelligence. A curated list of relevant papers and open-source resources is

Motivation: 传统方法依赖表格化BRDF数据，而神经隐式表示虽灵活但频域行为理解不足，需改进以实现更高保真度的渲染。

Method: 提出频率校正损失函数，结合球谐函数，构建通用且自适应的重建与编辑流程。

Result: 实验表明，FreNBRDF在材料外观重建和编辑上优于现有方法，提高了下游任务的结构化和可解释性。

Conclusion: FreNBRDF通过频域优化，显著提升了神经材料建模的保真度和适应性。

Abstract: Accurate material modeling is crucial for achieving photorealistic rendering,
bridging the gap between computer-generated imagery and real-world photographs.
While traditional approaches rely on tabulated BRDF data, recent work has
shifted towards implicit neural representations, which offer compact and
flexible frameworks for a range of tasks. However, their behavior in the
frequency domain remains poorly understood. To address this, we introduce
FreNBRDF, a frequency-rectified neural material representation. By leveraging
spherical harmonics, we integrate frequency-domain considerations into neural
BRDF modeling. We propose a novel frequency-rectified loss, derived from a
frequency analysis of neural materials, and incorporate it into a generalizable
and adaptive reconstruction and editing pipeline. This framework enhances
fidelity, adaptability, and efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
\ours improves the accuracy and robustness of material appearance
reconstruction and editing compared to state-of-the-art baselines, enabling
more structured and interpretable downstream tasks and applications.

Result: 实验证明，该方法在性能上匹配或超越现有技术，同时支持更复杂的数据依赖关系。

Conclusion: 该算法在高效性和表达能力上取得了显著进展，展示了其在现实应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Despite growing interest in process analysis and mining for data-aware
specifications, alignment-based conformance checking for declarative process
models has focused on pure control-flow specifications, or mild data-aware
extensions limited to numerical data and variable-to-constant comparisons. This
is not surprising: finding alignments is computationally hard, even more so in
the presence of data dependencies. In this paper, we challenge this problem in
the case where the reference model is captured using data-aware Declare with
general data types and data conditions. We show that, unexpectedly, it is
possible to compute data-aware optimal alignments in this rich setting,
enjoying at once efficiency and expressiveness. This is achieved by carefully
combining the two best-known approaches to deal with control flow and data
dependencies when computing alignments, namely A* search and SMT solving.
Specifically, we introduce a novel algorithmic technique that efficiently
explores the search space, generating descendant states through the application
of repair actions aiming at incrementally resolving constraint violations. We
prove the correctness of our algorithm and experimentally show its efficiency.
The evaluation witnesses that our approach matches or surpasses the performance
of the state of the art while also supporting significantly more expressive
data dependencies, showcasing its potential to support real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统人为可靠性分析（HRA）方法依赖专家判断，存在主观性和可重复性差的问题，且难以评估人机界面设计对操作员表现的影响。

Method: 通过AutoGraph构建界面嵌入知识图（IE-KG），结合实证行为数据，自动化识别HFE并评估界面设计风险。

Result: InSight-R提高了HFE识别的客观性和可解释性，为动态实时人为可靠性评估提供了可扩展的途径。

Conclusion: 该框架为界面设计优化提供了实用见解，并推动了机制驱动的HRA方法的发展。

Abstract: Human reliability remains a critical concern in safety-critical domains such
as nuclear power, where operational failures are often linked to human error.
While conventional human reliability analysis (HRA) methods have been widely
adopted, they rely heavily on expert judgment for identifying human failure
events (HFEs) and assigning performance influencing factors (PIFs). This
reliance introduces challenges related to reproducibility, subjectivity, and
limited integration of interface-level data. In particular, current approaches
lack the capacity to rigorously assess how human-machine interface design
contributes to operator performance variability and error susceptibility. To
address these limitations, this study proposes a framework for risk-informed
human failure event identification and interface-induced risk assessment driven
by AutoGraph (InSight-R). By linking empirical behavioral data to the
interface-embedded knowledge graph (IE-KG) constructed by the automated
graph-based execution framework (AutoGraph), the InSight-R framework enables
automated HFE identification based on both error-prone and time-deviated
operational paths. Furthermore, we discuss the relationship between
designer-user conflicts and human error. The results demonstrate that InSight-R
not only enhances the objectivity and interpretability of HFE identification
but also provides a scalable pathway toward dynamic, real-time human
reliability assessment in digitalized control environments. This framework
offers actionable insights for interface design optimization and contributes to
the advancement of mechanism-driven HRA methodologies.

Result: AI-DCS平台通过情感识别和语言适应，支持学生对不同政治观点的理解。

Conclusion: AI支持的策略可减少情感极化，同时保护学习者自主性，对公民教育和HCI有重要意义。

Abstract: Political polarization undermines democratic civic education by exacerbating
identity-based resistance to opposing viewpoints. Emerging AI technologies
offer new opportunities to advance interventions that reduce polarization and
promote political open-mindedness. We examined novel design strategies that
leverage adaptive and emotionally-responsive civic narratives that may sustain
students' emotional engagement in stories, and in turn, promote
perspective-taking toward members of political out-groups. Drawing on theories
from political psychology and narratology, we investigate how affective
computing techniques can support three storytelling mechanisms: transportation
into a story world, identification with characters, and interaction with the
storyteller. Using a design-based research (DBR) approach, we iteratively
developed and refined an AI-mediated Digital Civic Storytelling (AI-DCS)
platform. Our prototype integrates facial emotion recognition and attention
tracking to assess users' affective and attentional states in real time.
Narrative content is organized around pre-structured story outlines, with
beat-by-beat language adaptation implemented via GPT-4, personalizing
linguistic tone to sustain students' emotional engagement in stories that
center political perspectives different from their own. Our work offers a
foundation for AI-supported, emotionally-sensitive strategies that address
affective polarization while preserving learner autonomy. We conclude with
implications for civic education interventions, algorithmic literacy, and HCI
challenges associated with AI dialogue management and affect-adaptive learning
environments.

Conclusion: 提出以用户为中心的视觉隐私设计建议，强调数据责任。

Abstract: Blind and low vision (BLV) individuals use Generative AI (GenAI) tools to
interpret and manage visual content in their daily lives. While such tools can
enhance the accessibility of visual content and so enable greater user
independence, they also introduce complex challenges around visual privacy. In
this paper, we investigate the current practices and future design preferences
of blind and low vision individuals through an interview study with 21
participants. Our findings reveal a range of current practices with GenAI that
balance privacy, efficiency, and emotional agency, with users accounting for
privacy risks across six key scenarios, such as self-presentation,
indoor/outdoor spatial privacy, social sharing, and handling professional
content. Our findings reveal design preferences, including on-device
processing, zero-retention guarantees, sensitive content redaction,
privacy-aware appearance indicators, and multimodal tactile mirrored
interaction methods. We conclude with actionable design recommendations to
support user-centered visual privacy through GenAI, expanding the notion of
privacy and responsible handling of others data.

Conclusion: 研究表明，第一人称视频与可视化分析的结合对射击训练有显著价值，并可推广至其他精准运动。

Abstract: Marksmanship practices are required in various professions, including police,
military personnel, hunters, as well as sports shooters, such as Olympic
shooting, biathlon, and modern pentathlon. The current form of training and
coaching is mostly based on repetition, where the coach does not see through
the eyes of the shooter, and analysis is limited to stance and accuracy
post-session. In this study, we present a shooting visualization system and
evaluate its perceived effectiveness for both novice and expert shooters. To
achieve this, five composite visualizations were developed using first-person
shooting video recordings enriched with overlaid metrics and graphical
summaries. These views were evaluated with 10 participants (5 expert marksmen,

interpretation tasks, pairwise preference comparisons, and semi-structured
interviews. The results show that a dashboard-style composite view, combining
raw video with a polar plot and selected graphs, was preferred in 9 of 10 cases
and supported understanding across skill levels. The insights gained from this
design study point to the broader value of integrating first-person video with
visual analytics for coaching, and we suggest directions for applying this
approach to other precision-based sports.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索AI工具在客服代表与客户互动中的实际影响，理解AI整合的复杂性。

Method: 通过实地考察和半结构化访谈13名客服代表。

Result: AI减轻了打字和记忆等传统负担，但也引入了学习、合规和心理等新负担。

Conclusion: 研究深化了对AI在组织中整合的理解，并强调了客服代表为适应新系统所做的努力和负担。

Abstract: The integration of various AI tools creates a complex socio-technical
environment where employee-customer interactions form the core of work
practices. This study investigates how customer service representatives (CSRs)
at the power grid service customer service call center perceive AI assistance
in their interactions with customers. Through a field visit and semi-structured
interviews with 13 CSRs, we found that AI can alleviate some traditional
burdens during the call (e.g., typing and memorizing) but also introduces new
burdens (e.g., earning, compliance, psychological burdens). This research
contributes to a more nuanced understanding of AI integration in organizational
settings and highlights the efforts and burdens undertaken by CSRs to adapt to
the updated system.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLM）在模拟社交媒体政治话语时的行为，发现其输出更反映内部优化动态而非用户行为，导致结构性偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLM在模拟政治话语时的表现及其潜在影响，特别是在内容审核和政策建模中的应用。

Method: 基于2024年美国总统选举期间的2100万次X平台互动，构建了1186个真实用户的LLM代理，比较零样本和少样本初始化下的回复行为。

Result: 发现更丰富的上下文提高了内部一致性，但也加剧了极化、风格化信号和有害语言，并出现“生成夸张”现象。

Conclusion: LLM的输出更依赖内部优化而非用户行为，其作为社会代理的可靠性受到挑战。

Abstract: We investigate how Large Language Models (LLMs) behave when simulating
political discourse on social media. Leveraging 21 million interactions on X
during the 2024 U.S. presidential election, we construct LLM agents based on
1,186 real users, prompting them to reply to politically salient tweets under
controlled conditions. Agents are initialized either with minimal ideological
cues (Zero Shot) or recent tweet history (Few Shot), allowing one-to-one
comparisons with human replies. We evaluate three model families (Gemini,
Mistral, and DeepSeek) across linguistic style, ideological consistency, and
toxicity. We find that richer contextualization improves internal consistency
but also amplifies polarization, stylized signals, and harmful language. We
observe an emergent distortion that we call "generation exaggeration": a
systematic amplification of salient traits beyond empirical baselines. Our
analysis shows that LLMs do not emulate users, they reconstruct them. Their
outputs, indeed, reflect internal optimization dynamics more than observed
behavior, introducing structural biases that compromise their reliability as
social proxies. This challenges their use in content moderation, deliberative
simulations, and policy modeling.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何将自然语言处理（NLP）中的大型语言模型范式应用于生物语言建模，强调了结构评估的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于理解NLP的成功如何有效迁移到生物领域，尤其是考虑到自然语言和生物语言在结构相关性上的根本差异。

Method: 方法包括将生物分子的3D结构视为句子的语义内容，并考虑残基或碱基之间的强相关性，同时验证自回归生成范式在生物语言建模中的适用性。

Result: 结果表明，结构评估在生物语言建模中至关重要，且自回归范式在此领域具有适用性。

Conclusion: 结论指出，通过重新定义生物系统中的语言概念，可以更有效地将NLP技术应用于生物序列建模。

Abstract: The paradigm of large language models in natural language processing (NLP)
has also shown promise in modeling biological languages, including proteins,
RNA, and DNA. Both the auto-regressive generation paradigm and evaluation
metrics have been transferred from NLP to biological sequence modeling.
However, the intrinsic structural correlations in natural and biological
languages differ fundamentally. Therefore, we revisit the notion of language in
biological systems to better understand how NLP successes can be effectively
translated to biological domains. By treating the 3D structure of biomolecules
as the semantic content of a sentence and accounting for the strong
correlations between residues or bases, we highlight the importance of
structural evaluation and demonstrate the applicability of the auto-regressive
paradigm in biological language modeling. Code can be found at

Abstract: Synthesizing realistic microstructure images conditioned on processing
parameters is crucial for understanding process-structure relationships in
materials design. However, this task remains challenging due to limited
training micrographs and the continuous nature of processing variables. To
overcome these challenges, we present a novel process-aware generative modeling
approach based on Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large (SD3.5-Large), a state-of-the-art
text-to-image diffusion model adapted for microstructure generation. Our method
introduces numeric-aware embeddings that encode continuous variables (annealing
temperature, time, and magnification) directly into the model's conditioning,
enabling controlled image generation under specified process conditions and
capturing process-driven microstructural variations. To address data scarcity
and computational constraints, we fine-tune only a small fraction of the
model's weights via DreamBooth and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), efficiently
transferring the pre-trained model to the materials domain. We validate realism
using a semantic segmentation model based on a fine-tuned U-Net with a VGG16
encoder on 24 labeled micrographs. It achieves 97.1% accuracy and 85.7% mean
IoU, outperforming previous methods. Quantitative analyses using physical
descriptors and spatial statistics show strong agreement between synthetic and
real microstructures. Specifically, two-point correlation and lineal-path
errors remain below 2.1% and 0.6%, respectively. Our method represents the
first adaptation of SD3.5-Large for process-aware microstructure generation,
offering a scalable approach for data-driven materials design.

*Omar Claflin*

TL;DR: 论文提出神经网络信息编码的双重空间假设，开发了同时捕获特征身份和整合的架构，显著提升了重建性能和减少了错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏自编码器（SAE）方法假设激活可通过线性叠加分解为稀疏、可解释特征，但未能消除多义性且存在行为错误，因此提出双重编码假设。

Method: 开发了顺序和联合训练架构，同时捕获特征身份和整合模式，联合训练显著提升了性能。

Result: 联合训练重建性能提升41.3%，KL散度错误减少51.6%，非线性组件（3%参数）独立提升16.5%。干预实验显示整合特征对实验操作敏感且影响模型输出。

Conclusion: 研究为神经网络双重编码、非线性特征交互提供了系统证据，并提出了从后验特征分析到集成计算设计的架构范式转变。

Abstract: Current sparse autoencoder (SAE) approaches to neural network
interpretability assume that activations can be decomposed through linear
superposition into sparse, interpretable features. Despite high reconstruction
fidelity, SAEs consistently fail to eliminate polysemanticity and exhibit
pathological behavioral errors. We propose that neural networks encode
information in two complementary spaces compressed into the same substrate:
feature identity and feature integration. To test this dual encoding
hypothesis, we develop sequential and joint-training architectures to capture
identity and integration patterns simultaneously. Joint training achieves 41.3%
reconstruction improvement and 51.6% reduction in KL divergence errors. This
architecture spontaneously develops bimodal feature organization: low squared
norm features contributing to integration pathways and the rest contributing
directly to the residual. Small nonlinear components (3% of parameters) achieve
16.5% standalone improvements, demonstrating parameter-efficient capture of
computational relationships crucial for behavior. Additionally, intervention
experiments using 2x2 factorial stimulus designs demonstrated that integration
features exhibit selective sensitivity to experimental manipulations and
produce systematic behavioral effects on model outputs, including significant
interaction effects across semantic dimensions. This work provides systematic
evidence for (1) dual encoding in neural representations, (2) meaningful
nonlinearly encoded feature interactions, and (3) introduces an architectural
paradigm shift from post-hoc feature analysis to integrated computational
design, establishing foundations for next-generation SAEs.
