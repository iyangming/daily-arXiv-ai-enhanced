They also require human grounding in multi-modal environments,\nwhich can be ad-hoc, rigid, and brittle. Neural networks are good at extracting\nrich contextual information from multi-modal data, but lack interpretable\nstructures for reasoning.\n  Objectives: CALM aims to bridge the gap between logic and neural perception,\ncreating an analog logic that can reason over multi-modal inputs. Without this\nintegration, AI systems remain either brittle or unstructured, unable to\ngeneralize robustly to real-world tasks. In CALM, symbolic predicates evaluate\nto analog truth values computed by neural networks and constrained search.\n  Methods: CALM represents each predicate using a domain tree, which\niteratively refines its analog truth value when the contextual groundings of\nits entities are determined. The iterative refinement is predicted by neural\nnetworks capable of capturing multi-modal information and is filtered through a\nsymbolic reasoning module to ensure constraint satisfaction.\n  Results: In fill-in-the-blank object placement tasks, CALM achieved 92.2%\naccuracy, outperforming classical logic (86.3%) and LLM (59.4%) baselines.

Previous approaches use ad-hoc steps tailored to only specific\nmap styles. Recent machine learning-based text spotters (e.g., for scene\nimages) have the potential to solve these challenges because of their\nflexibility in supporting various types of text instances. However, these\nmethods remain challenges in extracting precise image features for predicting\nevery sub-component (boundary points and characters) in a text instance. This\nis critical because map text can be lengthy and highly rotated with complex\nbackgrounds, posing difficulties in detecting relevant image features from a\nrough text region. This paper proposes PALETTE, an end-to-end text spotter for\nscanned historical maps of a wide variety. PALETTE introduces a novel\nhyper-local sampling module to explicitly learn localized image features around\nthe target boundary points and characters of a text instance for detection and\nrecognition. PALETTE also enables hyper-local positional embeddings to learn\nspatial interactions between boundary points and characters within and across\ntext instances. In addition, this paper presents a novel approach to\nautomatically generate synthetic map images, SynthMap+, for training text\nspotters for historical maps. The experiment shows that PALETTE with SynthMap+\noutperforms SOTA text spotters on two new benchmark datasets of historical\nmaps, particularly for long and angled text. We have deployed PALETTE with\nSynthMap+ to process over 60,000 maps in the David Rumsey Historical Map\ncollection and generated over 100 million text labels to support map searching.\nThe project is released at\nhttps://github.com/kartta-foundation/mapkurator-palette-doc.", "AI": {"tldr": "PALETTE是一种端到端文本识别器，用于扫描历史地图，通过超局部采样模块和合成数据训练，显著提升了长文本和倾斜文本的识别效果。", "motivation": "历史地图中的文本包含丰富的地理、历史和文化信息，但传统方法难以处理多样化的地图风格和复杂背景。", "method": "提出PALETTE，引入超局部采样模块学习文本实例的边界点和字符特征，并结合合成数据SynthMap+进行训练。", "result": "PALETTE在历史地图数据集上优于现有方法，成功处理了6万张地图并生成1亿多个文本标签。", "conclusion": "PALETTE为历史地图文本识别提供了高效解决方案，支持大规模地图搜索应用。"}}

In the context of\nWhole Slide Image (WSI) classification, FL faces significant challenges,\nincluding heterogeneous computational resources across participating medical\ninstitutes and privacy concerns. To address these challenges, we propose\nFedWSIDD, a novel FL paradigm that leverages dataset distillation (DD) to learn\nand transmit synthetic slides. On the server side, FedWSIDD aggregates\nsynthetic slides from participating centres and distributes them across all\ncentres. On the client side, we introduce a novel DD algorithm tailored to\nhistopathology datasets which incorporates stain normalisation into the\ndistillation process to generate a compact set of highly informative synthetic\nslides. These synthetic slides, rather than model parameters, are transmitted\nto the server. After communication, the received synthetic slides are combined\nwith original slides for local tasks. Extensive experiments on multiple WSI\nclassification tasks, including CAMELYON16 and CAMELYON17, demonstrate that\nFedWSIDD offers flexibility for heterogeneous local models, enhances local WSI\nclassification performance, and preserves patient privacy. This makes it a\nhighly effective solution for complex WSI classification tasks.
