When an AI system is engineered for deductively\nwatertight guarantees (demonstrable certainty about the error-free nature of\nits outputs) -- as in classical symbolic AI -- its operational domain must be\nnarrowly circumscribed and pre-structured. Conversely, a system that can input\nhigh-dimensional data to produce rich information outputs -- as in contemporary\ngenerative models -- necessarily relinquishes the possibility of zero-error\nperformance, incurring an irreducible risk of errors or misclassification. By\nmaking this previously implicit trade-off explicit and open to rigorous\nverification, the conjecture significantly reframes both engineering ambitions\nand philosophical expectations for AI. After reviewing the historical\nmotivations for this tension, the article states the conjecture in\ninformation-theoretic form and contextualises it within broader debates in\nepistemology, formal verification, and the philosophy of technology. It then\noffers an analysis of its implications and consequences, drawing on notions of\nunderdetermination, prudent epistemic risk, and moral responsibility.

Previous\nwork~\\cite{rahmani2024synthetic} showed that synthetic test collections have\nthe potential to be used for system evaluation, however, more analysis is\nneeded to validate this claim. In this paper, we thoroughly investigate the\nreliability of synthetic test collections constructed using LLMs, where LLMs\nare used to generate synthetic queries, labels, or both.

Central to AniMaker's approach are two key technical\ncomponents: MCTS-Gen in Photography Agent, an efficient Monte Carlo Tree Search\n(MCTS)-inspired strategy that intelligently navigates the candidate space to\ngenerate high-potential clips while optimizing resource usage; and AniEval in\nReviewer Agent, the first framework specifically designed for multi-shot\nanimation evaluation, which assesses critical aspects such as story-level\nconsistency, action completion, and animation-specific features by considering\neach clip in the context of its preceding and succeeding clips.

Generative AI (GAI) technologies, such\nas large language models (LLMs) and image generation tools, are increasingly\nintegrated into applications aimed at enhancing human social experiences.\nDespite their growing presence, little is known about how these technologies\ninfluence social interactions. This scoping review investigates how GAI-based\napplications are currently designed to facilitate social interaction, what\nforms of social engagement they target, and which design and evaluation\nmethodologies designers use to create and evaluate them. Through an analysis of\n30 studies published since 2020, we identify key trends in application domains\nincluding storytelling, socio-emotional skills training, reminiscence,\ncollaborative learning, music making, and general conversation. We highlight\nthe role of participatory and co-design approaches in fostering both effective\ntechnology use and social engagement, while also examining socio-ethical\nconcerns such as cultural bias and accessibility.

The\nchallenge lies in the existing shallow safety alignment techniques: they only\ndetect harm in the immediate prompt and do not reason about long-range intent,\nleaving them blind to malicious intent that emerges over a sequence of\nseemingly benign instructions. We therefore propose adding an external monitor\nthat observes the conversation at a higher granularity. To facilitate our study\nof monitoring decomposition attacks, we curate the largest and most diverse\ndataset to date, including question-answering, text-to-image, and agentic\ntasks. We verify our datasets by testing them on frontier LLMs and show an 87%\nattack success rate on average on GPT-4o. This confirms that decomposition\nattack is broadly effective. Additionally, we find that random tasks can be\ninjected into the decomposed subtasks to further obfuscate malicious intents.\nTo defend in real time, we propose a lightweight sequential monitoring\nframework that cumulatively evaluates each subtask. We show that a carefully\nprompt engineered lightweight monitor achieves a 93% defense success rate,\nbeating reasoning models like o3 mini as a monitor.
