When an AI system is engineered for deductively\nwatertight guarantees (demonstrable certainty about the error-free nature of\nits outputs) -- as in classical symbolic AI -- its operational domain must be\nnarrowly circumscribed and pre-structured. Conversely, a system that can input\nhigh-dimensional data to produce rich information outputs -- as in contemporary\ngenerative models -- necessarily relinquishes the possibility of zero-error\nperformance, incurring an irreducible risk of errors or misclassification. By\nmaking this previously implicit trade-off explicit and open to rigorous\nverification, the conjecture significantly reframes both engineering ambitions\nand philosophical expectations for AI. After reviewing the historical\nmotivations for this tension, the article states the conjecture in\ninformation-theoretic form and contextualises it within broader debates in\nepistemology, formal verification, and the philosophy of technology. It then\noffers an analysis of its implications and consequences, drawing on notions of\nunderdetermination, prudent epistemic risk, and moral responsibility.

The measured point cloud is registered with the\nreference CAD model, followed by an error analysis conducted at three\nhierarchical levels: global, part, and feature. At the global level, the error\nanalysis evaluates the overall deviation of the scanned point cloud from the\nreference CAD model. At the part level, error analysis is performed on these\npatches underlying the point clouds. We propose a novel optimization-based\nprimitive refinement method to obtain a set of meaningful patches of point\nclouds. Two basic operations, splitting and merging, are introduced to refine\nthe coarse primitives. At the feature level, error analysis is performed on\ncircular holes, which are commonly found in CAD models. To facilitate it, a\ntwo-stage algorithm is introduced for the detection of circular holes. First,\nedge points are identified using a tensor-voting algorithm. Then, multiple\ncircles are fitted through a hypothesize-and-clusterize framework, ensuring\naccurate detection and analysis of the circular features.

We evaluate\nGigaVideo-1 on the VBench-2.0 benchmark using Wan2.1 as the baseline across 17\nevaluation dimensions. Experiments show that GigaVideo-1 consistently improves\nperformance on almost all the dimensions with an average gain of about 4% using\nonly 4 GPU-hours.

Our\ncontributions include: (1) A two-stage PTQ strategy that combines\nblock-reconstruction-based optimization for fast, stable initial quantization\nand local dependency capture, followed by a global calibration of quantization\nparameters to minimize accuracy loss. (2) A Statistically-Driven Global Affine\nCalibration (GAC) method that enables the network to compensate for cumulative\nstatistical distortions arising from factors such as neglected BN layer\neffects, even reducing the error of existing PTQ methods on video matting tasks\nup to 20%. (3) An Optical Flow Assistance (OFA) component that leverages\ntemporal and semantic priors from frames to guide the PTQ process, enhancing\nthe model's ability to distinguish moving foregrounds in complex scenes and\nultimately achieving near full-precision performance even under ultra-low-bit\nquantization. Comprehensive quantitative and visual results show that our\nPTQ4VM achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy performance across different\nbit-widths compared to the existing quantization methods. We highlight that the\n4-bit PTQ4VM even achieves performance close to the full-precision counterpart\nwhile enjoying 8x FLOP savings.", "AI": {"tldr": "本文提出了一种专为视频抠图模型设计的后训练量化（PTQ）框架PTQ4VM，通过两阶段策略、全局仿射校准和光流辅助组件，显著提升了量化模型的精度和时序一致性，在低比特量化下接近全精度性能。", "motivation": "视频抠图在资源受限设备上部署时面临计算密集型模型的挑战，现有的后训练量化方法在精度和时序一致性上存在不足。", "method": "提出两阶段PTQ策略（块重建优化和全局校准）、统计驱动的全局仿射校准（GAC）方法，以及光流辅助（OFA）组件。", "result": "PTQ4VM在不同比特宽度下均达到最先进精度，4比特量化下性能接近全精度模型，计算量减少8倍。", "conclusion": "PTQ4VM为视频抠图量化提供了高效解决方案，显著提升了量化模型的实用性和性能。"}}

Across leading commercial (GPT-4o, Claude 4\nSonnet, Gemini 2.5 Flash) and open-source models (Gemma-2 27B, Gemma-3,\nMistral-24B), we find that adding realistic context such as company names,\nculture descriptions from public careers pages, and selective hiring\nconstraints (e.g.,``only accept candidates in the top 10\\%\") induces\nsignificant racial and gender biases (up to 12\\% differences in interview\nrates). When these biases emerge, they consistently favor Black over White\ncandidates and female over male candidates across all tested models and\nscenarios. Moreover, models can infer demographics and become biased from\nsubtle cues like college affiliations, with these biases remaining invisible\neven when inspecting the model's chain-of-thought reasoning. To address these\nlimitations, our internal bias mitigation identifies race and gender-correlated\ndirections and applies affine concept editing at inference time. Despite using\ndirections from a simple synthetic dataset, the intervention generalizes\nrobustly, consistently reducing bias to very low levels (typically under 1\\%,\nalways below 2.5\\%) while largely maintaining model performance.

Also, this\nalgorithm ensures the camera ends up at a suboptimal (if the optimal one is\nunreachable) location among the locations already searched, with limited energy\navailable for moving the camera. Unlike a simple brute force approach, the\nalgorithm enables the camera to explore space more efficiently by adapting the\nsearch policy from learning the environment. With the aid of an image averaging\ntechnique, this algorithm, in use of a solo camera, achieves the observation\naccuracy in eye-to-hand configurations to a desirable extent without filtering\nout high-frequency information in the original image. An automated\nmanufacturing application has been simulated and the results show the success\nof this algorithm's improvement of observation precision with limited energy.", "AI": {"tldr": "提出一种算法优化眼到手配置中相机位置，通过探索工作空间找到噪声最小的位置，提升观测精度。", "motivation": "现有研究多关注控制和观测架构，但相机位置对图像质量的影响被忽视，尤其在制造环境中噪声水平因位置不同而变化。", "method": "设计相机移动策略算法，结合图像平均技术，高效搜索最优或次优位置，确保有限能量下的观测精度。", "result": "模拟制造应用显示，该算法在有限能量下显著提升观测精度，且保留高频信息。", "conclusion": "该算法有效优化相机位置选择，提升眼到手配置的观测质量，适用于自动化制造任务。"}}

It\nenables the scalable generation of high-quality, controllable and\nphotorealistic 3D assets with accurate physical properties and real-world scale\nin the Unified Robotics Description Format (URDF) at low cost. These assets can\nbe directly imported into various physics simulation engines for fine-grained\nphysical control, supporting downstream tasks in training and evaluation.\nEmbodiedGen is an easy-to-use, full-featured toolkit composed of six key\nmodules: Image-to-3D, Text-to-3D, Texture Generation, Articulated Object\nGeneration, Scene Generation and Layout Generation. EmbodiedGen generates\ndiverse and interactive 3D worlds composed of generative 3D assets, leveraging\ngenerative AI to address the challenges of generalization and evaluation to the\nneeds of embodied intelligence related research.

Given a candidate solution $\\hat{x}$\nproduced by an algorithm of the user's choice, we propose inverting the\nsolution by running the unconditional probability flow ODE in reverse starting\nfrom $\\hat{x}$, and then using the resulting latent as an initialization for\nDPS. We evaluate our wrapper on hard inverse problems like large box\nin-painting and super-resolution with high upscaling. Whereas state-of-the-art\nbaselines visibly fail, we find that applying our wrapper on top of these\nbaselines significantly boosts sample quality and measurement consistency. We\ncomplement these findings with theory proving that on certain multimodal data\ndistributions, ReGuidance simultaneously boosts the reward and brings the\ncandidate solution closer to the data manifold.

Such fundamental\ndisparities in the nature of the data have limited neural networks from\nachieving a comparable level of success in scientific applications as seen in\nother fields. Neural operators are a principled way to generalize neural\nnetworks to mappings between function spaces, offering a pathway to replicate\ndeep learning's transformative impact on scientific problems. For instance,\nneural operators can learn solution operators for entire classes of PDEs, e.g.,\nphysical systems with different boundary conditions, coefficient functions, and\ngeometries. A key factor in deep learning's success has been the careful\nengineering of neural architectures through extensive empirical testing.\nTranslating these neural architectures into neural operators allows operator\nlearning to enjoy these same empirical optimizations. However, prior neural\noperator architectures have often been introduced as standalone models, not\ndirectly derived as extensions of existing neural network architectures. In\nthis paper, we identify and distill the key principles for constructing\npractical implementations of mappings between infinite-dimensional function\nspaces. Using these principles, we propose a recipe for converting several\npopular neural architectures into neural operators with minimal modifications.\nThis paper aims to guide practitioners through this process and details the\nsteps to make neural operators work in practice.
